[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:08.029 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.280 align:middle line:10%
And I'm eminently excited
to bring you a special guest

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.250 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be chatting
with Ira Israel.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:84%
My wife Laurentine met
Ira at a spiritual center

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.380 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles a
number of years ago.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And since then, we've
crossed paths many times.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.440 align:middle line:84%
He is a psychotherapist,
counselor,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and mindfulness
relationship expert,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and he's taught mindfulness
to psychologists,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:84%
medical practitioners,
attorneys, everyday people all

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a
fantastic book called

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:84%
"How to Overcome Your Childhood
Now That You're an Adult."

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a fantastic read,
and it's something

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.327 align:middle line:84%
that is very important in
this day and age, I think,

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:50.985 align:middle line:84%
as we start to reflect on how
we've been shaped as a human

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and how we can overcome some
of the trauma and challenges

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that we may have been exposed
to in our younger years.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Ira.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> James, thank you
for having me here.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm excited to chat.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So where I normally start
most conversations is really

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:90%
around this idea of--

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I find that most people
have some form of catalyst

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:84%
or something that happened
to then that sort of put them

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.910 align:middle line:84%
on this trajectory of
being, in your case,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
in the mindfulness sort
of space or industry.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
How did that start
for you, and what

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:90%
was this journey like for you?

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> In January of 1985, I was
a passenger in a car accident,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and my face was
blown off my head,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and my femur was
shattered into 200 pieces.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Normally, some of the bone
pierces the femoral artery

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.250 align:middle line:90%
and you bleed out in 50 seconds.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And instead, a
doctor was called in.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
He was called in
to amputate my leg.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I just
read this article.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
A Swiss doctor named Zichal
has this contraption.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to amputate.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put him in traction
and put him back together.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So over the next
couple of years,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I started asking, like,
what's the meaning of life,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.548 align:middle line:84%
and why is the world so messed
up, and all these things.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And I went on this journey that
I didn't know I was going on.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It actually took 25 years,
which I'm not proud of.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I feel like a slow learner.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:84%
But for the first eight
years, I studied philosophy.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And then in Thailand in '94, I--

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:90%
again, this is my idiocy.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I walked into a door frame
because I'm tall, right?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And a woman healed
me with her hands.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I started thinking,
like, maybe all this philosophy

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:90%
is kind of misguided.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's other things.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So then I started
studying spirituality.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So I studied Buddhism,
Hinduism, Kabbalah.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, eight years
later, I started studying--

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I was in a relationship.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It was not going swimmingly.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
studying psychology.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So over those 25 years-- and
I had gone to film school,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and I had gone to
yoga teacher training.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.975 align:middle line:90%
I got into meditation.

00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I was teaching yoga

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
at Rodney Yee's yoga studio
and a woman walked in

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:90%
and she put her hands down.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how insane this
sounds, but I heard a voice.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And it said, OK,
it's time to teach.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, you've been
indulgent for 25 years.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
You've been just
studying all this stuff.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.740 align:middle line:90%
Now it's time to give back.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting,
because during those 25 years,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:84%
if you looked at my
life from the outside,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
you'd be like, oh
yea, the poor soul.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
He's in an ashram in India
or he's in a cafe in Paris

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
or-- like, you know, it wasn't
a terrible life, but it was--

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:84%
there was no, like, central
focus other than, like, Ira

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.360 align:middle line:84%
indulgently
questioning everything.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, right from
that point in time,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.480 align:middle line:90%
I put an ad on Craigslist.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I hired a cinematographer
and a director

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and I made "Yoga for
Depression and Anxiety."

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.370 align:middle line:84%
It became a bestseller
three months later,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.245 align:middle line:84%
and then I made "Mindfulness
for Depression."

00:04:03.245 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I made "Mindfulness
for Anxiety."

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And then it everything collapsed
into this, like, perfect--

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
this is who you're
supposed to be.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's fascinating
to me because I see--

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
when I have patients in my
office now, when they come in,

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I can kind of get a feel--

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:84%
like, oh yeah,
that was me when I

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
was at the beginning or the
middle or kind of the end.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And something will
come together.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what it
is, but the universe

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.198 align:middle line:84%
will give you
information, and then

00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
you'll become who
you're supposed to be.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It's really interesting
because I study

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:90%
how your mind represses things.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they come up
at different times.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But the repressions--
you know, what

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Freud said about repressions--
whatever's repressed

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:90%
comes back thricefold.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So I've worked hard in therapy
and with plant medicine

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and with shamans and
healers and things

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
so that I've integrated
the pain, because somebody

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.238 align:middle line:90%
told me--

00:05:07.238 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:84%
you remember certain things
from being in the hospital.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Someone told me that the most
painful thing a woman can

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:84%
experience is
natural childbirth,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and the most painful
experience a man can experience

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:90%
is a femur broken.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It takes a piano from
five stories dropped down.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Your femur's the largest
bone in your body.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:90%
It's the strongest thing.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the top of
mine was just--

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:90%
it was just fragments, pieces.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I obviously was
in a lot of pain.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:90%
But there was, you know--

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you an
interesting story.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
15 years later, I was
in a yoga class, right?

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:90%
And I went to this gentleman.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to name his name.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But people will know who he
is when I tell the story.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.627 align:middle line:84%
So I had moved to Santa Barbara
to study Buddhism and Hinduism.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And people said, you got
to do yoga with this guy.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:90%
You gotta do yoga with this guy.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So I go to this class,
and I'm a hardcore purist

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:90%
about everything.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And so after about 20 minutes,
the guy shuts off the lights

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and he plays "I Will
Survive," and he

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:90%
says, "Dance on your mat."

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was not open to
that, and I just, like--

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.428 align:middle line:90%
I rolled up my mat and left.

00:06:24.428 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that
guy's a weirdo, man.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not into that
California bullshit.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Like, I want to do yoga, man.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was
just, like, crazy.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.183 align:middle line:84%
So like a year and
a half later, I

00:06:35.183 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
was like, OK, people are
saying, you got to go back.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't do that all time.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:90%
You got to go back.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:90%
You got to go back.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And I went back.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And he remembered
me from walking out.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And he had asked at
the beginning of class,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:90%
does anyone have any injuries?

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I told him about my
injuries and whatnot.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's two years later, right?

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Pigeon Pose
on the left side.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:84%
The guy hasn't touched
me all class, right?

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:90%
He's my size, 200 pounds.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:90%
He comes over.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:84%
My leg's in front
of me like this.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
He puts his weight on my back,
and he whispers in my ear,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
"I remember that you have an
issue with your left leg."

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.585 align:middle line:84%
And I snapped back into the car
screaming, "Don't let me die.

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to die."

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:90%
And so your mind--

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I was saying that to
a paramedic, you know?

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's, like,
the glimpse I have

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.307 align:middle line:84%
of the week that's been
repressed where someone drilled

00:07:45.307 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:84%
a hole through my
leg and other people

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
were putting things in here and
putting my face back together

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and doing all this stuff.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But, you know,
it's not a contest.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's stupid
for me to say I

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:90%
experienced this terrible pain.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm with patients every day,
and I cry about their traumas

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:90%
more than I--

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:84%
or as much as I cry
about my traumas.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:90%
This is life, you know?

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:90%
We want to be loved.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:90%
We don't have good tools.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Things happen, and
it's very traumatizing.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And the best we can do is
nurture our own resilience so

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that we can show up and
have some understanding

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and create a narrative and
transmute our own suffering

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
into making the
world a better place

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
by not doing the
natural thing of paying

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
our suffering forward, by
showing up in a way and saying,

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.390 align:middle line:84%
no, my mind is telling me
to go and hurt that person.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And instead, I'm
going to forgive them.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I want that person
to have a great life.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's awesome.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Can we stay a little bit on
the story of this car crash,

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.160 align:middle line:84%
because it seems like a
big sort of point for you

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.660 align:middle line:90%
in your journey.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:90%
After that crash happened--

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:90%
so you had this leg issue.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You also talk about the face,
and it went through, and then

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the
emotions that you

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
went through sort of in
the first immediate years

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:90%
after that?

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing that was most
transformational was that--

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
so I would go out for years
after, and people would say,

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.440 align:middle line:84%
hey, how'd you get
that scar on your face?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Or it'd be like I'd be out
at some place or I even--

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Some woman came up
to me in a bar once.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:84%
She said, what happened
to your face, you know?

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.632 align:middle line:84%
And people-- and I
meet them all time,

00:09:55.632 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:90%
people who have facial scars.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:84%
It's very traumatizing
because that's

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.837 align:middle line:90%
your facade to the world.

00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:03.170 align:middle line:90%
You're like this is your person.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And mine was-- it took
five different surgeries

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to put it back together so that
I have some kind of semblance

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.515 align:middle line:90%
of a normal smile.

00:10:11.515 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm very fortunate to have
not had my teeth blown out.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So I always would
say, kind of proudly,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I was almost killed
in a car accident.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So for about 25
years until I started

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
getting more and more into
compassion and Buddhism

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:90%
and things like that--

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.798 align:middle line:84%
and finally, I took
a course, and you had

00:10:33.798 --> 00:10:35.090 align:middle line:90%
to tell the story of your life.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.967 align:middle line:84%
And someone said, OK,
what happened here?

00:10:39.967 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I was almost
killed in a car accident.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
gentleman who was tasked

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:90%
with deconstructing the story.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I was almost
killed in a car accident.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.105 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, you weren't.

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, actually,
my femur was shattered.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:90%
My face was blown off my head.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
They didn't notify my
parents because they didn't

00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:90%
think I was going to live.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Trust me, I was almost
killed in a car accident.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no, you weren't.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:90%
We went back and forth.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, he says,
there was a car accident.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything else you added.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:90%
You can't be almost pregnant.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:90%
You can't be almost dead.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:90%
You're either alive or dead.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.960 align:middle line:90%
There was a car accident.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:90%
So language creates reality.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
The way you choose
to frame your life--

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're either the
hero of your story

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:90%
or you're the victim.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And for those first 25 years,
I realized in that instant

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that I was sucking
people into my drama,

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to get them
to be empathetic,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and I just made a
conscious choice, like, no.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So when people ask me now, it's
like, there was a car accident.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Language creates reality.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really we have to
be impeccable in the words

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
that we choose
because we're trying

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.210 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate authentic
love, and you can't do

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:90%
that if you're just a facade.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That was probably one of the
most profound parts of the book

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.133 align:middle line:84%
of yours that I read,
this realization that you

00:12:12.133 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:90%
weren't almost killed.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can't almost
be pregnant, right?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:90%
You can't almost be killed.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:90%
You're either alive or dead.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.565 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I was in a car
accident or even positive--

00:12:21.565 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I survived a car
accident would be even

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:90%
more of a positive spin on it.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was
also this part--

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean to labor on this.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to more things.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But you actually looked up the
gentleman that was with you.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.928 align:middle line:84%
So this was in
your teens, right?

00:12:35.928 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you could
mention that as well.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So you were 18 at the
time or something, or 19.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And so at that age, I mean, I've
been in cars with 18-year-olds.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.858 align:middle line:90%
People drive like losers.

00:12:45.858 --> 00:12:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've
got your feet pushed

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.025 align:middle line:84%
through the bottom of the floor
because you're like, slow down,

00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:90%
slow down, buddy, you know?

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And so to go back and apologize
to someone, first of all,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:90%
or to find them--

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, difficult. But
then to muster up the courage

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
to do that and to
do it authentically

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.195 align:middle line:84%
and to really make
peace with that is huge.

00:13:03.195 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Tell me that process.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:90%
So how old were you?

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.457 align:middle line:84%
Like, what went
through your mind?

00:13:06.457 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And then how much later
was it when you finally

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:90%
reconciled this?

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had been
studying compassion,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and the term that I use
in the book is at onement

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
or atonement, and the
key tool is forgiveness.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
So I took a compassion
workshop, and it was fascinating

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:90%
because I had been having--

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:90%
I'll be frank here.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
If during the first 25 years
after the car accident--

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:90%
this is so embarrassing--

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.110 align:middle line:84%
if someone had said, I'm sorry,
you have pancreatic cancer,

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
die in two months--

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I had this vengeance fantasy
of going to find this driver

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and doing to his face
what happened to mine.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And I would find myself,
like, in the middle

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.650 align:middle line:84%
of the night sometimes just
having these horrible--

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, like, the
world isn't just

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:90%
and this whole terrible thing.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And there was something
that Fred Luskin, who

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
wrote "Forgive
for Good--" he was

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.117 align:middle line:90%
speaking about these topics.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I went home from
the conference that night,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote a letter to the
guy, the driver of the car.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:90%
And I just put it away.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mean to
send it or anything.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I woke up the next
morning, and I read it,

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.012 align:middle line:84%
and I was just like,
let me check out

00:14:29.012 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:90%
what's on the internet.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So I googled him,
found him on Facebook,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and I set up a second
Ira Israel account

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
so he would see
it's me, but I just

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:84%
didn't want him to see my
whole life or anything.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And I sent the letter.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I just told them what I'd done
for those 25 years and things

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
that I was feeling and
whatnot, and I went to work.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And I came home.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
It was probably, like,
6 o'clock at night.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK, let me check
this other Facebook account.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, I received
an equally long letter.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It was very-- and I
started to read it,

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and it was really heartfelt.
And it's surprising to everybody

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
when you show up
in a certain way.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, I can't tell you,
James, be vulnerable, right?

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.110 align:middle line:84%
But if I show up
in a certain way,

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.170 align:middle line:90%
I can inspire you or enroll you.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know how much
personal work this person

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
had done over the past
25 years or something.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But he showed up
like a gentleman.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And we went back and forth for
a week talking about our lives.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the week, he
had told me how sorry he was.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason I
just felt compelled,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and I just wrote
in all capitals,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:84%
"If it helps you in any
way, I forgive you."

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And I closed the account,
and I deleted the account,

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and I never had any of those
machinations or anything.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, all-- like, it's just--
it was the wildest thing.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just, like, all
of the negativity.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's why in the book
I talk about this irony--

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
because your mind was built to
create resentments-- woulda,

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:90%
coulda, shoulda, didn'ts.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
things that show up

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
as the causes of suffering,
because you're trying

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:90%
to change the unchangeable.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I can't go back to
1985, and if I did,

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
something worse might
have happened, right?

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But your mind is this incredible
machine that looks at the past

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:84%
and says, wow, that
was really traumatic.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
let that happen again.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.359 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to lift weights or
I'm going to be this person

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.160 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to get
rich or I'll show them

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and you do this
whole crazy thing.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And you-- I wanted to write
a book about authenticity

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
because I felt
that we become what

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:28.349 align:middle line:84%
we love and we become what we
hate and both are inauthentic.

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's a part
of us that wants

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
to be loved by our parents
and the people around us.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:90%
So we emulate.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:90%
We imitate them.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
If they're, you know--
and then there's

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
this part that is trying
to individuate and become

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:90%
our own selves.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So we get tattoos,
and we have long hair,

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
or we buy-- if they
have a German car,

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
we buy an American
car, you know?

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this conflict,
I feel, in all of us

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
that we want to be loved,
but we want to be our own--

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:90%
we want to have our own agency.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And forgiveness is
a huge part of that.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
quote by Lily Tomlin

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.690 align:middle line:90%
that I quote in the book.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.370 align:middle line:84%
"Forgiveness means giving up all
hope of having a better past."

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So your mind does
this incredible thing

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:84%
where it's constantly trying
to, like, rewrite your history.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're only causing
your own suffering

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.230 align:middle line:84%
because it's like trying to jam
a square peg into a round hole.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:90%
You can't change the past.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if you're out
there and you're like, well,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll show them that they
shouldn't have mistreated me

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:84%
because I'll be famous and
I'll be rich and I'll do these

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
things, you'll get there and
then you'll realize that those

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:90%
people don't--

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:90%
you don't exist to them.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So you've lived your whole life
for this inauthentic reason,

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
like, this vengeance fairy tale
or this, like, I'll show them.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So I really hope that, in
my classes and in the book

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and on the DVDs, that
I inspire people just

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:84%
to question their whys,
why they're doing things,

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:16.260 align:middle line:84%
and then realize that
there is a set of tools

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:84%
available to keep us at the high
end of our happiness spectrums.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that correlates
strongly with happiness

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.155 align:middle line:84%
is the quality of our
intimate relationships,

00:19:25.155 --> 00:19:28.003 align:middle line:84%
how we connect
with other people.

00:19:28.003 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Money-- nobody wants worked
really hard on their tombstone.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if we go across
the street right now,

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.210 align:middle line:84%
there'll be kids in
cafes with earbuds

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
on just thinking that
they're working really hard--

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:44.940 align:middle line:84%
and so this whole American
fiction of, like, homeownership

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and going into debt
and all these things

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that keep people amped up
and in fight or flight mode

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and not sleeping well and then
eventually cancer or depression

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.120 align:middle line:90%
or these things.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We really have to just
sit down and question

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
all the underlying
systems in our culture

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and see which ones are
bringing out the best in us

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and making us compassionate,
loving, authentic human beings.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a big system to unravel.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Before we jump to
this depression

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and our modern landscape of
everything that we've created,

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
which I really want
to get to, I want

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:84%
to stay for a little bit
on this topic of sort

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:84%
of the primary caregivers and
how they can impact your life.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So you talk about how when we're
young, we do a lot of things

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.120 align:middle line:90%
to get love and approval.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And then when we're
older, we sort of wonder

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.377 align:middle line:84%
why we're doing things or
what's the best thing we should

00:20:41.377 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
do in our life, and
we're questioning,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:90%
how can we be authentic?

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Also, maybe we could talk
about if you've grown up

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
or if people have grown
up in an environment that

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.150 align:middle line:84%
is being potentially abusive
or with a narcissistic parent

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
or with a split
personality or bipolar

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:middle line:84%
parent, what experiences
they may have had as a child,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:84%
how they would have
coped with that,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and then as you
get into adulthood,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
how do you start
to heal or unravel

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.760 align:middle line:84%
some of the trauma that could
have happened in that time

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and make sense of your life
now that you're an adult?

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you hold a baby up to a
mirror, its eyes go like this.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
because it has no self.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So we are creatures of language,
and there's this individuation

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:84%
process where a baby
finally is like,

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
you know, looking at
the mirror and then

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:84%
finally looking at the mother
and realizing that it's not

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.770 align:middle line:90%
at one with the mother.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And we individuate in
America very abruptly.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Science says-- medicine
says that breastfeeding

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:90%
for 18 months is optimum.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:90%
I was born in 1966.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors went
to my parents and said,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.520 align:middle line:84%
we have this chemical
formula that's

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.980 align:middle line:90%
superior to mother's milk.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole
swath of people

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.380 align:middle line:90%
who were never breastfed.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that correlates to
our poor attachment dynamics

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
later in life because we're
interdependent beings.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you are put down as
a baby and allowed to-- you

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:84%
know, they allow babies to
cry themselves out, right?

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's essentially
the baby assimilates

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.920 align:middle line:90%
that as you're killing me.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.152 align:middle line:90%
Like, I can't survive alone.

00:22:27.152 --> 00:22:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, don't worry,
we'll be back in eight hours.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.068 align:middle line:84%
But the baby doesn't
speak English.

00:22:31.068 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So the baby's just thinking,
like, I'm dying, right?

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And they cry itself
out until it sleeps.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
that when you're

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
fired 35 years
later from your job

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:84%
or when your boyfriend or
girlfriend cheats on you,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
it reopens the primal
abandonment wound.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So my main interest
is how people

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.600 align:middle line:84%
feel betrayed by
their own parents,

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.925 align:middle line:84%
because it's all babies want
is to be loved unconditionally.

00:22:57.925 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:90%
That's all they want.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:90%
They want to be safe.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:01.597 align:middle line:90%
They want to be held.

00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:90%
They want to be fed.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:90%
They want to be cleaned, right?

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:90%
And in our culture--

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, I have friends
who send their kids

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.583 align:middle line:84%
to these schools
at two years old.

00:23:09.583 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, yeah, they
have a really high acceptance

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:90%
rate for Harvard.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, your kid
wants to play with clay.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Your kid is not concerned about
going to Harvard in 16 years.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, why are you putting
all this pressure, you know?

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:84%
So there's a component of
our highly competitive brand

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
of capitalism, which has
influenced parenting.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing, as
I mentioned in our book,

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
parenting comes in
waves, ebbs and flows.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So after World War
II, what I noticed

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:84%
was that parents
were really afraid

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Cold War of Russia,
bombing, another Hitler.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:84%
They lived through all
this terrible stuff.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I find that a lot of
people in that generation

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
were emotionally withholding
and they had these conceptions

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that if our kids become
doctors and lawyers,

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
then when the second Hilter
comes, we'll be ready.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:84%
They just had this whole
other thing happening.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And I also say in the book-- and
I'll say this right upfront--

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, we have
to say, our parents

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.193 align:middle line:84%
did the best that they could
with the tools that they had.

00:24:18.193 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
If you're walking around
blaming your parents,

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.693 align:middle line:84%
you're only hurting
yourself, right?

00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:84%
They did the best
that they could.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, the irony is, if
parents want to really help

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:84%
the growth of their children,
at some point in time,

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.227 align:middle line:84%
they should say
something like this--

00:24:34.227 --> 00:24:35.310 align:middle line:90%
we could have done better.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's this-- like,
that's fascinating to me

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that, for us, we have to
always say my parents did

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:90%
the best that they could.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that I
always take into account--

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how this
will go over, but it's karma.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you
believe in karma, then

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.740 align:middle line:90%
you chose those people, right?

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.257 align:middle line:90%
So that to me really helps.

00:25:01.257 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask people-- if they
come in and they're just like,

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.048 align:middle line:84%
this terrible thing happened,
this terrible thing happened,

00:25:06.048 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and my father did this, my
mother did this, I'm like, OK.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.500 align:middle line:84%
When-- after it's all
over, I'll be like,

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:84%
so why did your soul--
what did your soul

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.310 align:middle line:84%
need to learn that they chose
to be incarnated by these two

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.110 align:middle line:90%
people?

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So you think part of the
process of deciphering meaning

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:84%
out of having potentially
abusive parents is to question

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
in retrospect, what was I here
to learn from that experience?

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I
mentioned in the book,

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%
as we spoke about before--

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:84%
so his holiness the Dalai Lama I
sat with at various conferences

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and things, and
people say, you know,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:90%
who's your greatest teacher?

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And as the spokesperson
for Buddhism in the West,

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:84%
the answer has to be the
Buddha is my greatest teacher.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:90%
And what does he say?

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:01.750 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese-- who bludgeoned
with ax handles two million

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:90%
of his followers, right?

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's his greatest teacher.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So for me, owning your life
means reframing it to say,

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm here today.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm safe.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Yes, my face was blown
off my head 33 years ago.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I had this
kind of relationship

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:84%
with my parents or this
person or this was humiliating

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.080 align:middle line:90%
or this or something.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But instead of fighting
reality, a reality

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can't
change, the sooner

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:84%
you own it is the
sooner you'll let

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:90%
go of all those resentments.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And those resentments
are now the adage

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.990 align:middle line:90%
from the 12-step program.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Resentment is like poking
yourself in the eye

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for your
parents to go blind.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Resentment is like
drinking poison and waiting

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.850 align:middle line:84%
for your older brother, who
kicked your ass every day,

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.020 align:middle line:90%
to get sick.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.160 align:middle line:90%
He's not going to get sick.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:90%
You're only poisoning yourself.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
So you have to forgive
all these people

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and say they did
the best they could.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And listen, I know it's a hard
pill to swallow, you know?

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.350 align:middle line:90%
It took me 25 years.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just like-- and when
the trauma is really close--

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
I know of a few people
who knew they were going

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:84%
to be assaulted, and
they spoke to the person

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
who was about to do harm to
them and forgave them then.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.790 align:middle line:84%
But those people are a lot
more sophisticated than I am.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.192 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.192 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, I
think the Dalai Lama--

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's incredible.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.587 align:middle line:84%
For him to say something
like that is profound,

00:27:44.587 --> 00:27:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and I think it takes
someone like that

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:90%
to say something like that.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for that.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we covered
that quite well.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll just-- one other thing.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So again, my whole
interest is consciousness

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.320 align:middle line:90%
and the human mind.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that our primary desire
is to be loved unconditionally.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And we grew up in
this crazy society

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.430 align:middle line:84%
which only gives us tools
to gain love conditionally.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually in this
giant resentment factory

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.600 align:middle line:84%
because we can never have
what our hearts crave, right?

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I studied this
psychiatrist who

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
says that language,
even just talking,

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.880 align:middle line:84%
estranges us from the
real phenomenon of being.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's really an
interesting concept,

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.270 align:middle line:84%
because in America, Sonja
Lyubomirsky, who lives down

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:35.910 align:middle line:84%
the street, she wrote a
book, "The How of Happiness,"

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and she talks about
the Hedonic treadmill.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So all the things
that were taught

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
by social media and the
media that will make us happy

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.090 align:middle line:90%
actually make us miserable.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And ironically, I
live in a culture

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.140 align:middle line:84%
with the inalienable
right to pursue happiness.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is the worst
thing ever, right?

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.930 align:middle line:90%
You cannot pursue happiness.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not-- it's a ramification.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is a byproduct.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So what you need to
do is sleep correctly,

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.160 align:middle line:84%
have loving relationships,
eat well, get some exercise.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not brain surgery.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet 100 million
prescriptions

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.570 align:middle line:84%
for antidepressants are
written in this country

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.400 align:middle line:90%
of 330 million people.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:84%
22 million Americans take
antidepressants every day,

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think it's
some rogue gene that

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:90%
just afflicts Americans.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to look
at our school system.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at this
nuclear family or the

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
being raised by a
single mom or single dad

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and then working 80 hours a
week and being proud of it.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is an insane
time we're living in.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:90%
All of us have our phones.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of the times
they're under our pillows

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anyone who
doesn't go to the bathroom

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:84%
without an iPad or
something in there.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you just have
those five minutes of,

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:90%
like, you know, a little just--

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.540 align:middle line:90%
it's crazy, right?

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.030 align:middle line:84%
If aliens came down
and looked at--

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.340 align:middle line:84%
just they went into
Abbot Kinney where

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.252 align:middle line:84%
you were yesterday
in Intelligentsia

00:29:58.252 --> 00:30:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and looked at everyone
with their sunglasses on

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:00.990 align:middle line:90%
and their iPods--

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.010 align:middle line:90%
no one's looking at each other.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:90%
You can't say anything.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.070 align:middle line:90%
They're frowning.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:84%
They're like-- they're
paying $8 for coffee.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like, none of
this makes sense, right?

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean-- and we do it every day.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we've designed--

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.680 align:middle line:90%
OK, maybe a deeper question.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you're
willing to answer this.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.940 align:middle line:84%
This system we designed
around education--

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.030 align:middle line:84%
primary education,
secondary, college, whatever

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:30.780 align:middle line:90%
we call it between countries--

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:36.540 align:middle line:84%
this capitalistic consumerist
society and this produced GDP,

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.970 align:middle line:84%
produced economic output at
any cost-- think about it.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We measure a company--
a country's success

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:90%
on GDP, right?

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.006 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is a fiction.

00:30:43.006 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It has no
correlation to anything.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.350 align:middle line:84%
But if there's a mother at
home looking after a child,

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:84%
there's no economic
output for that.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.920 align:middle line:84%
If she goes back
into the workforce

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and puts her child in daycare,
it's a double economic output.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
There's money going
into the daycare.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.997 align:middle line:84%
There's money
coming from the job.

00:30:57.997 --> 00:31:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the greatest
contributing factors to GDP is

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.930 align:middle line:90%
car accidents.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.900 align:middle line:84%
There's really
terrible things that

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.450 align:middle line:84%
contribute to our
domestic product

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.985 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, like, things
being destroyed and ambulances

00:31:11.985 --> 00:31:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and all the billion
dollar industries--

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure pornography.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's-- like, GDP
is a stupid measurement.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because there was
a debate last Friday night

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:84%
between Slavoj Zizek, the
philosopher, and Jordan

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Peterson.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- the problem I see
now is that we're not having

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.690 align:middle line:90%
the right conversations.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.270 align:middle line:84%
When you have people
arguing about GDP

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and how this is
happening and there's

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.820 align:middle line:84%
been this type of growth,
you're not on the ground

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:84%
sitting there with the
workers from Walmart or Amazon

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.020 align:middle line:84%
who don't have health
insurance who are on welfare.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have these
bullshit statistics

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:84%
that people use to
buttress arguments

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.100 align:middle line:84%
so that the rich get richer
and the poor get poorer.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But really we need
equality of opportunity

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.017 align:middle line:84%
so that people have a fair
shot of going to college.

00:32:02.017 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
bribe their way in,

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.808 align:middle line:84%
like we've just had all
these terrible scandals here.

00:32:05.808 --> 00:32:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But, really, Jewish
people were not

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.870 align:middle line:84%
allowed at Harvard
University until the 1920s.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:90%
That's 300 years.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.530 align:middle line:90%
We have terrible misogyny.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.460 align:middle line:90%
We have terrible racism.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:84%
This country is just
full of hypocrites.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.417 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and it's the best
country in the world.

00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I live here.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I could live any place.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:90%
I live here.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I enjoy the freedoms, free
speech, things like that.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you really look
at the systems in place,

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.760 align:middle line:84%
the myth of romantic
love and the money

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
swirling around
marriages and divorces,

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
businesses, man.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of money, right?

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And then all the heartbreak--
and then people like me,

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapists,
marriage counselors,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:90%
who people sign up for life.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I make the
joke in the book.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, marriage for
life was a fantastic idea

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:53.720 align:middle line:84%
in the 13th century when
people lived to be 28.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.030 align:middle line:84%
But now that we're
living until 87,

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:84%
we should have renewable
marriage contracts.

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:00.182 align:middle line:84%
On your anniversary, you
should sit down and say, well,

00:33:00.182 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:90%
what'd you like this year?

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:90%
What didn't you like?

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, I can do better.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll sign on again, right?

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.470 align:middle line:90%
If you have a kid--

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.370 align:middle line:90%
18 years.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.260 align:middle line:84%
These are just
commonsensical things.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But we live on this whole
other paradigm of Christianity,

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.080 align:middle line:84%
marriage for life,
and we really need

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.960 align:middle line:84%
to rethink our government,
the way we're interacting,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.640 align:middle line:90%
and our work-life balance.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.712 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:33:23.712 --> 00:33:25.670 align:middle line:84%
There was an acronym you
mentioned in the book,

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and I think it was--

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIRD.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>> WEIRD.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:90%
What does that stand for?

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:32.730 align:middle line:90%
And what does it mean?

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, if you
want to riff on this,

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:84%
how did we get into
this area of these goals

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
striving for and how

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.035 align:middle line:84%
we're sort of missing the
happiness boat because of that?

00:33:44.035 --> 00:33:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So the first, the acronym,
what does it stand for?

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.360 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Ironically, we live in
a society that could be

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.900 align:middle line:90%
identified by the acronym WEIRD.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.770 align:middle line:84%
We're Western, educated,
industrialized, rich,

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:58.730 align:middle line:90%
and democratic.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting
thing in terms of the DSM,

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:84%
the Diagnostic Statistical
Manual of Disorders,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:12.409 align:middle line:84%
is that we inflict our diagnoses
on the rest of the world.

00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:84%
But, actually, WEIRD
populations are only 12%

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:90%
of the entire world society.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So the reason I like to
talk about these things

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:30.050 align:middle line:84%
is because Thomas Kuhn
in 1968 wrote a book

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and talked about paradigm
shifting every 25 years.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:39.469 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the DSM, there
was a "New York Times" article

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:45.800 align:middle line:84%
about 13 years ago that stated
that 56% of the psychiatrist

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.810 align:middle line:84%
who wrote for the
DSM had taken money

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:49.739 align:middle line:90%
from pharmaceutical companies.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.350 align:middle line:90%
So there's this component.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going into some
kind of conspiracy theory.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that people
benefit from other people being

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.700 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So as a psychotherapist,
I avoid diagnoses

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.920 align:middle line:84%
because those labels
confine people.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And people get into
this whole thing

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.330 align:middle line:84%
where I feel they're
terribly disempowered.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.090 align:middle line:84%
If you say, oh yeah,
my mother is bipolar

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and her mother is bipolar
and everyone's bipolar

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.770 align:middle line:84%
so I have to be on these
medications, that's

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:17.060 align:middle line:90%
very disempowering.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no solution
but that pill.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:26.900 align:middle line:84%
For me, if you say, yeah, I'm
a human being and occasionally

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I have these emotions
that are highly unpleasant

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to try to
find a solution to that

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.660 align:middle line:90%
that is not some kind of pill--

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and listen, I work
with schizophrenics.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I work with severely
challenged people,

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and they need to be medicated,
too, so that they don't do harm

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to themselves or other people
or can function in society.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.540 align:middle line:84%
However, not everybody
who just wants to--

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.900 align:middle line:84%
like, these kids today,
they're on ADHD medication.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:84%
They have this game
that they play.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
our school system.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Our school system was
developed to make workers.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody needs to study
chemistry, and yet in America

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.380 align:middle line:90%
everyone studies chemistry.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone should be studying
art if you need to be this.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.455 align:middle line:84%
And we just force
these kids, and then

00:36:11.455 --> 00:36:13.580 align:middle line:84%
if they don't like the
stuff that they're studying,

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.370 align:middle line:84%
we dope them up on this,
like, cocaine-like substance,

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:90%
this amphetamine, you know?

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And I have these
kids in my office,

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and they can play
this trick on doctors.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:90%
They go into the doctor office.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.340 align:middle line:84%
They're like, I find
myself looking out

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.977 align:middle line:90%
the window in blank class.

00:36:30.977 --> 00:36:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor just--
there was this article

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:37.520 align:middle line:84%
where, like, doctors were
seeing patients, kids, for seven

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
minutes and just
prescribing ADHD medication.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And then the kids
can't sleep, and then

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.140 align:middle line:84%
there's this whole
cycle of craziness,

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and they start really young,
like, 7, 8, 9 years old.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.000 align:middle line:90%
They don't need medication.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.290 align:middle line:90%
These kids need hugs.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.730 align:middle line:90%
They need to go play baseball.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.400 align:middle line:90%
They need to play with dolls.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And we live in this culture
that's so competitive.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a win or take all
society, and everybody

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.230 align:middle line:84%
wants to be Bill Gates
or Angelina Jolie

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.643 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who's on a
kiosk, but they don't really,

00:37:05.643 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to have
Asperger's like Bill Gates,

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want to have a
double mastectomy like Angelina

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Jolie.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:15.360 align:middle line:84%
You just want to have her $400
million or his $36 billion.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But if we explain to people
that doesn't make you happier,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:21.760 align:middle line:84%
you just have a different
set of problems.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Bill-- there was an
article last week.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Mark Zuckerberg last
year spent $22 million

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.330 align:middle line:84%
to not have his family
harmed, $22 million.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.180 align:middle line:84%
You could feed a small country
in Africa for that money.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.000 align:middle line:90%
He can't go to Intelligentsia.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:90%
He can't go out of the house.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.980 align:middle line:90%
He can't do anything.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a militia
around Bill Gates.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.490 align:middle line:84%
When Bill Gates goes some
place to speak, it's like--

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%
there's this whole-- the bomb
sweeping and all this crazy

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.020 align:middle line:90%
stuff.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at these kids today.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.370 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to
do when you grow up?

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I want to be Bill Gates.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.890 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
have a militia.

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:84%
You want to go walk on the
beach and jump in the ocean.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
have 50 guys with guns

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.200 align:middle line:84%
strapped all over them so
that you can get an ice cream.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:90%
I think one of the really--

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.450 align:middle line:84%
one of the most profound
things that happened to me when

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm young-- and I'm so
grateful for all the

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.397 align:middle line:84%
experiences in my
life, and I feel

00:38:16.397 --> 00:38:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that I've been given
mentors in my life

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.660 align:middle line:84%
to teach me about
experiences very early on.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And Laurentine's godfather
was a big mentor of mine,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.710 align:middle line:90%
big in Siddhi Yoga.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And his message he
got from the guru

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.790 align:middle line:84%
was multifaceted,
that one was, if you

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:90%
see duality, laugh at it.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Experience oneness
in everything.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.430 align:middle line:90%
And be grateful for this life.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.700 align:middle line:90%
That was his three boons.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Super profound.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Then another gentleman
in a similar sort of--

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:52.360 align:middle line:84%
he was also involved in
the same lineage of yoga--

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.110 align:middle line:90%
was taught this message.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of--

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I've stolen both of their
messages for myself--

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.200 align:middle line:90%
borrowed, should we say.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything is absolutely
always unfolding perfectly,

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.022 align:middle line:90%
not for a reason, good or bad.

00:39:05.022 --> 00:39:06.730 align:middle line:84%
That was-- this happened
for that reason.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:07.900 align:middle line:90%
That was bad, you know?

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But that everything
is absolutely always

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:10.023 align:middle line:90%
unfolding perfectly.

00:39:10.023 --> 00:39:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's perfection
in everything.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:84%
That's really helped me move
faster through trauma or issues

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.640 align:middle line:84%
because I'm like, what is
seeking to emerge from this?

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.980 align:middle line:84%
What is the perfection
seeking to emerge from this?

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I also worked for two
of the wealthiest people

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.500 align:middle line:84%
in the world, one involved in a
similar company, the person you

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:90%
just mentioned.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I used to drive
their private yacht.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was a
previous career of mine.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned is that
money doesn't make you healthy,

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and money doesn't
make you happy.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.187 align:middle line:84%
So why have we got all these
goals that we're aiming for?

00:39:41.187 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're ultimately
not good goals.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Like, I live also in a
developing country called

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Vanuatu, and Vanuatu
actually placed

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:53.600 align:middle line:84%
number one on the Happy Person
Index, the HPI, in 2016.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Congratulations.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thank you.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So what do you think it is?

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a resident.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a national
of that country.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>> They only polled James.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I was not living
there at the time.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.270 align:middle line:84%
But if-- I think Bhutan was one
of the first winners, right?

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it's been tracked,
and people question the index.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But still they're trying to
measure some form of happiness.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So they won in 2016, and
it is just almost comical

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.020 align:middle line:90%
how happy they are.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be driving to
school in the morning,

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and there's a pickup
truck in front,

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and they're all standing in
the back, all these guys,

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.860 align:middle line:90%
laughing and singing.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Then it rains.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.213 align:middle line:90%
And they're getting drenched.

00:40:26.213 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's 6:30, 7
o'clock in the morning.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're singing,
and they're laughing,

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and a friend will jump off the
truck and nearly trip over,

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:84%
and they laugh, and
they're laughing.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.050 align:middle line:90%
They're all high fiving.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:36.790 align:middle line:90%
They're just ecstatic.

00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:39.220 align:middle line:84%
These guys live in a
shared home, like, eight

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.870 align:middle line:90%
or 10 other people.

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:42.760 align:middle line:90%
They own next to nothing.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:84%
They maybe go to
church or some religion

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:middle line:84%
or some form of
meditation or practice

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.240 align:middle line:84%
towards some higher
power once a week.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.450 align:middle line:90%
They respect each other.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:51.880 align:middle line:90%
They have a chief system.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.520 align:middle line:84%
They have no poverty
in their country

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:84%
because everyone has food
and shelter because you're

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.340 align:middle line:84%
a chief system and there's
food growing everywhere.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.400 align:middle line:90%
They're so happy.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I fly in and
out of that country

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:07.690 align:middle line:84%
to, like, LA, New York,
packed European cities

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:84%
with this congestion
issue and immigration.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Then I go to Australia, which
is also amazing but also stuck

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.530 align:middle line:84%
under this whole rule of,
like, own your own home.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.012 align:middle line:90%
That's the Australian dream.

00:41:18.012 --> 00:41:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And people are stressed out,
putting their kids in daycare.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's a free and
happy country like America,

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.680 align:middle line:84%
it's still there's this
oppressive sort of systems that

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.180 align:middle line:84%
are just driving
us down, and you've

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
got this country stuck
in the middle of nowhere,

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:90%
happy as Larry.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:32.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:34.700 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And how do we solve
these problems?

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, I don't want to go
into somewhat of intentional

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:41.080 align:middle line:90%
conspiracy theory.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But what's manifested since
the 1950s when America was

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.410 align:middle line:84%
primarily a middle-class
society is that--

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that you got this
from my book-- but power

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.250 align:middle line:90%
corrupts.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And the four-- the founding
fathers of our society

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.490 align:middle line:90%
didn't take that into account.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So every system has been
corrupted by the people

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.660 align:middle line:90%
on top for their own benefit--

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our taxation system,
the school system, the board

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.020 align:middle line:90%
of directors, all these--

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of companies and
things like that.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:16.630 align:middle line:90%
And we need to figure out--

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:20.200 align:middle line:84%
it's been really fascinating
to watch people say, you know,

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.090 align:middle line:90%
I want a free market society.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And as I say in the book,
a free market society

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:27.260 align:middle line:84%
means that you say, here, you
want to buy these carrots,

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and I stab you in the
neck and take the carrots.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a free market.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But we have regulations against
murder, against robbery,

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.520 align:middle line:90%
against all these things.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And we've become
anti-authoritarian

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:39.490 align:middle line:90%
in our culture.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:42.790 align:middle line:84%
For America, it's been
since Ronald Reagan.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Big government.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Government's bad, you know?

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I tell people, if you
don't like big government,

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:84%
don't live in a country with
330 million people and 300

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:58.780 align:middle line:84%
million guns because someone's
got to protect us from those--

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:84%
that situation because
it's not tenable.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not sustainable
because people get angry

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and they shoot their
guns, you know?

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So for me we have to figure
out a way to account for this--

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to call it--

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.410 align:middle line:90%
because it's not an aberration.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:22.510 align:middle line:84%
When you become WEIRD, rich
like this, there's this envy.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:27.400 align:middle line:84%
There's this craziness
where you always project--

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.130 align:middle line:84%
like with social media,
you measure your insides

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.750 align:middle line:90%
by other people's outsides.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So you see them and you're
like, wow, they're happy

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.730 align:middle line:90%
and they're smoking crack.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Like, I should smoke crack.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Or they have a Bentley
or they do whatever.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And you just-- your mind
does this crazy stuff.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So then for me what
I teach i s have

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.760 align:middle line:84%
to be able to cultivate
non-reactivity, which

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.940 align:middle line:84%
we do through meditation,
and understand

00:43:54.940 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that your mind was devised
to give you bad information.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:05.230 align:middle line:84%
But it starts with wanting
to be loved unconditionally.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:90%
And then your mind--

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.510 align:middle line:84%
the way it reacts to
traumas when you're a kid,

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:13.720 align:middle line:90%
it's twofold.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, it says, wow,
that was humiliating.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I will never let
that happen again.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:20.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you are this thing,
this facade, this persona

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.100 align:middle line:90%
for the next 70 years.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I tell
people in the classes

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:84%
is whatever persona
you developed

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.740 align:middle line:84%
to help you survive
your childhood

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and get your emotional
and psychological needs

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.630 align:middle line:84%
met when you were seven
or eight, fantastic.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was, if
you were the cool guy,

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:84%
if you were the jock,
if you were the--

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:45.910 align:middle line:90%
whatever you were, it's great.

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But now that you're 35, I
bet that those same qualities

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:52.450 align:middle line:84%
are hindering you from getting
the authentic love that you

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:53.770 align:middle line:90%
really crave.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:54.940 align:middle line:90%
So there's an irony there.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So at some point
in time after you

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:01.120 align:middle line:84%
realize that you've become
what you love from your parents

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and caregivers and you've become
what you hate, the opposite--

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.240 align:middle line:84%
to individuate-- you
have to pull yourself up

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.340 align:middle line:84%
by your own bootstraps and
say, this is who I want to be.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And you have to realize
that that's a luxury.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.257 align:middle line:84%
There's been people who
don't have enough food

00:45:14.257 --> 00:45:16.900 align:middle line:84%
or who are running from tigers
and doing all this crazy stuff,

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and you live in this Western
industrialized country

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.920 align:middle line:84%
where you're like, I
want to fly to the moon.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.920 align:middle line:90%
I want to make a record.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.730 align:middle line:90%
I want to paint.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.230 align:middle line:90%
I want to do these things.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:28.370 align:middle line:90%
And that's a privilege.

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to really
cultivate gratitude, cultivate

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.720 align:middle line:84%
non-reactivity, and
be able to show up

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:38.770 align:middle line:84%
in the present moment
as love so that you

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.690 align:middle line:90%
attract that from other people.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:43.900 align:middle line:84%
You can't just, as I said,
say, James, be vulnerable,

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.450 align:middle line:90%
be loving, you know?

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:84%
The best you can do is inspire
them to be their highest self

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.822 align:middle line:90%
by you showing up that way.

00:45:51.822 --> 00:45:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so beautiful.

00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And I really-- I play
with that a little bit.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I play with the
gratitude process a lot,

00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, because--

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.510 align:middle line:84%
one of-- someone I
met a long time ago.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed,
fortunately,

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds of
people who I look up to,

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:07.330 align:middle line:90%
yourself included.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said, turn your
have-to's into a get-to, right?

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Not many people get the
opportunity to start a company

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:16.660 align:middle line:90%
or do this or that.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like, whoa,
I get to do that.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:90%
You look-- 90%--

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.960 align:middle line:84%
or 88% of the world
is not a WEIRD,

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.510 align:middle line:84%
a Western, industrialized, rich,
educated, democratic country

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:30.250 align:middle line:90%
of people-- group of people.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.590 align:middle line:90%
They're just living day to day.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.780 align:middle line:84%
But then their happiness
is generally higher.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So their gratefulness
is that they got up,

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
that they survived, that
they had a meal, you know?

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Our gratefulness is, like,
well, where's my paycheck?

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:44.813 align:middle line:84%
Where's my 401(k)
retirement plan?

00:46:44.813 --> 00:46:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because we've
been fooled and--

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.563 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

00:46:47.563 --> 00:46:51.310 align:middle line:84%
But we've been fooled into
this system that has told us--

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:55.690 align:middle line:84%
they've given us these signals
that if you have this big house

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:56.600 align:middle line:90%
you will be happy.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.900 align:middle line:84%
If you have this beautiful
wife, you'll be happy.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.380 align:middle line:84%
If you make two kids and
send them to this school,

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.530 align:middle line:90%
you'll be happy.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I feel is the
midlife crisis in America

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:13.420 align:middle line:84%
is really this overwhelming
sense of betrayal,

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.390 align:middle line:84%
because I have friends
who did all those things,

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:17.830 align:middle line:84%
they accomplished
all those goals,

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're not happy, right?

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And so then they start to do
the materials, the things.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:24.400 align:middle line:90%
They buy a Porsche.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.540 align:middle line:90%
They get a mistress.

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:29.230 align:middle line:84%
They go to Vegas or whatever,
and that doesn't work either.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they have to figure
out, like, OK, what am I doing?

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I did everything right.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.690 align:middle line:90%
That didn't make me happy.

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:39.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to really sit
down and figure this out

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:40.690 align:middle line:90%
at 40 years old.

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:42.460 align:middle line:90%
I have to-- you know?

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's a really--

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:47.110 align:middle line:84%
it's a conundrum that we live
in this society with all these

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:90%
freedoms and we're--

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.910 align:middle line:84%
America's always, like, 12th
or 19th on the happiness scale.

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned,
all the people who are

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:57.760 align:middle line:84%
on pharmaceuticals, who take
these medications every morning

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.740 align:middle line:84%
just to get through
their day, and they're--

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.800 align:middle line:84%
we're so-- 3.5 billion
people live on $1.90 a day.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.860 align:middle line:90%
None of those people--

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I just came from Erewhon
with the $8 coffee,

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.310 align:middle line:90%
and it's like it's Burning Man.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:14.292 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's just
so rich in there.

00:48:14.292 --> 00:48:15.250 align:middle line:90%
You look at the prices.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:16.120 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
think to yourself,

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:20.890 align:middle line:84%
yeah, 25% of these people took
anti-depressants this morning,

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:21.690 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:22.780 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're-- who sleep in a bed
with nine other people or who

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:30.460 align:middle line:90%
share meals--

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:35.170 align:middle line:84%
like, I see kids in their
cars eating on the way.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:90%
They're on the phone.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.040 align:middle line:84%
They got a latte
and the earbuds.

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, you're going
to kill somebody and end up

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:45.010 align:middle line:84%
in jail because you're
trying to be so productive.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But happiness is
not in productivity.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is, like,
I'm here with you.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Like, I want to be
with other people.

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:53.920 align:middle line:90%
We're interdependent.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.680 align:middle line:84%
We need to really learn
how to break bread.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And in America,
we've just eradicated

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:05.740 align:middle line:84%
the basic fundamental
emotional needs,

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and then we diagnose
these people as whatever

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:10.480 align:middle line:90%
and give them pills.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So for me, we need an inversion
of our political and economic

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.600 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And as we were
discussing earlier--

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:25.060 align:middle line:84%
you know, TS Eliot
wrote in the '40s,

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.270 align:middle line:84%
does it end with a
bang or a whimper?

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, like, Obama
would be the whimper.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:36.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to another
society, right?

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:39.580 align:middle line:84%
My country is $22
trillion in debt.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.590 align:middle line:84%
All of my friends and
I are beneficiaries

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:45.700 align:middle line:84%
through mortgages, credit
card, and school loans.

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.700 align:middle line:90%
We're beneficiaries.

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, we've authorized
our government

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.560 align:middle line:84%
to do this massive Ponzi scheme
on the rest of the fucking

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.650 align:middle line:84%
planet so that we can
live high on the hog.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:59.230 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what's
going to happen.

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.147 align:middle line:84%
Is there going to
be a revolution?

00:50:02.147 --> 00:50:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Is China going to say we don't
want to loan you money anymore?

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's going to happen?

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But people like you
and I, hopefully, we're

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.090 align:middle line:90%
team transition.

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:16.840 align:middle line:84%
We're here so when all these
buildings, all the light

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.850 align:middle line:84%
goes off and there's
no electricity

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:21.940 align:middle line:84%
and there's no heat,
we can figure out,

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.800 align:middle line:84%
oh yeah, I read about
this in the book.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.290 align:middle line:84%
This is how you make a
fire from two sticks.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.263 align:middle line:84%
I think we can
survive this week,

00:50:28.263 --> 00:50:29.680 align:middle line:84%
because in America
everyone's just

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.820 align:middle line:84%
thinking, like, oh,
I want a Ferrari

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:84%
and then I want a Lamborghini
and I want this stuff

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and I want this more stuff
and I want-- no one's happy.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.320 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.590 align:middle line:90%
I feel like the Earth is this--

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Gaia is this
mechanism, and humanity

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:54.130 align:middle line:84%
killing a billion pigs, a
billion cows, and the way

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.830 align:middle line:84%
that they're slaughtered, what
we've done to the oceans--

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:00.070 align:middle line:84%
like, we could be
hemorrhaged off of our planet

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:03.250 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
so deleterious.

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.100 align:middle line:90%
We've caused so much harm.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's in our interpersonal
relationships with each other.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not even that
this person is--

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:15.820 align:middle line:84%
what happened in
Sri Lanka yesterday.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's Easter and
seven guys go into churches

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.370 align:middle line:84%
and blow themselves up
and kill 207 people.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I have nothing--

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.160 align:middle line:90%
it's just so-- it's--

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.950 align:middle line:90%
I want to say it's embarrassing.

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:35.800 align:middle line:84%
It's embarrassing that
we're human beings

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.280 align:middle line:84%
and we allow other
human beings to think

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that this is an activity
that they should partake in.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:84%
How did that happen that
we're just so misguided?

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:52.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is shocking.

00:51:52.463 --> 00:51:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
we can go there.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.880 align:middle line:90%
That's a big discussion.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.960 align:middle line:84%
I probably think where
we could transition too--

00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.250 align:middle line:90%
what you touched on earlier--

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:01.740 align:middle line:84%
is talking about this
happiness conundrum

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and how we want all this,
but then we're not happy.

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And you quickly brushed
over a few practical steps

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.800 align:middle line:90%
that we can take.

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.758 align:middle line:84%
So maybe let's focus on
that a little bit more.

00:52:09.758 --> 00:52:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, gratitude practice,
what does it look like?

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.190 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:16.187 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, what
does it look like?

00:52:16.187 --> 00:52:17.020 align:middle line:90%
How do you teach it?

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.090 align:middle line:90%
What is that like?

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:20.970 align:middle line:84%
What other practices
are there that, I guess,

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:25.950 align:middle line:84%
are all-encompassing in terms
of trauma, happiness, whatever?

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:28.530 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be something
that you just recommend

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:30.570 align:middle line:90%
as broad strokes for people.

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:33.420 align:middle line:84%
What-- how do these
practical applications

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.900 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness or
awareness or authenticity

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:37.960 align:middle line:90%
and how do they work?

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So knowing how
the mind operates--

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:41.340 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very privileged.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:44.810 align:middle line:84%
In my office, when
patients walk out,

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:49.390 align:middle line:84%
there's these big billboards for
Hulu and all these companies.

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's also some kind
of home across the street,

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and there's always a kind
of a homeless person that

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.010 align:middle line:84%
had their leg amputated
or some kind of person who

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:01.770 align:middle line:84%
has to live in an
assisted living facility.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because our minds look up.

00:53:07.210 --> 00:53:09.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
compare yourself,

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:12.820 align:middle line:84%
you could just as easily compare
yourself, particularly me--

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.090 align:middle line:84%
and when I see the
guy across street

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:17.190 align:middle line:84%
in the wheelchair
with one leg, my mind

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:18.585 align:middle line:90%
is like, that could be me.

00:53:18.585 --> 00:53:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't look up and see some
celebrity in a sports car

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and say, that could be me,
but a lot of people do.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what media and
social media teaches you.

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It teaches you to--

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.300 align:middle line:84%
if I work hard, I can
be the next whoever.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Accept who you are today.

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, you can try to
make your life better,

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:44.490 align:middle line:84%
but know the things that are
going to just make you happy,

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be the quality
connecting with other people,

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.830 align:middle line:84%
being grateful for
what you do have,

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and then having these tools such
as yoga and meditation so that

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:58.140 align:middle line:84%
you cultivate being present
and then also non-reactivity,

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.300 align:middle line:90%
because your mind is built to--

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.020 align:middle line:84%
you're basically a
bundle of reactions

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:08.090 align:middle line:90%
waiting for stimuli, which is--

00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:10.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you see one thing,
you're going to be like--

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.550 align:middle line:90%
you'll have this reaction to it.

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to do
is get people to just tune

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.880 align:middle line:84%
into their breath, be
in the present moment,

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and explore their prejudices and
own them and say, like, yeah,

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:27.490 align:middle line:84%
this happened to me, I was
traumatized, and I'm safe now.

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need that
defense mechanism

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:31.650 align:middle line:90%
of being this other thing.

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So as you know in the book,
I break down authenticity

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:36.810 align:middle line:84%
into attachment, atonement,
attunement, presence,

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
and congruence.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So attachment is knowing
your attachment dynamic,

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.140 align:middle line:84%
knowing that if you've had
five failed relationships

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and this particular thing
always happens, you're there.

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:50.040 align:middle line:84%
You're contributing
to that happening.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:54.720 align:middle line:84%
That's your-- that's a
ramification of your way

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.290 align:middle line:84%
of believing that the universe
is either abundant and full

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:02.970 align:middle line:84%
of love and full of grace or
you have to hoard and you have

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:04.583 align:middle line:84%
to be suspicious
of other people,

00:55:04.583 --> 00:55:06.250 align:middle line:84%
because if you turn
your back, they'll--

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:07.050 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:09.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have a
basic underlying paradigm,

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:11.640 align:middle line:84%
so you should know
your attachment dynamic

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:16.830 align:middle line:84%
because that-- you can then
think of how you are showing up

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:17.730 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:55:17.730 --> 00:55:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And then atonement
is at onement.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.910 align:middle line:90%
You're basically a child of God.

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:24.840 align:middle line:84%
You're whole, and
you're perfect.

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's room
for improvement,

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:32.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you have this
ego which has been tempered,

00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:38.340 align:middle line:84%
let's say, or colored by your
parents, who your soul chose,

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and then reading the
newspaper and going to schools

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and having all this
pressure on you.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So for atonement, you
just need to forgive.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.100 align:middle line:84%
You have to forgive
unequivocally, because those--

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:55.260 align:middle line:84%
any time you don't forgive,
that is your desire

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.900 align:middle line:90%
to share your suffering.

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.270 align:middle line:90%
As a species, we enjoy--

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:05.910 align:middle line:90%
and I say that sadly.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at
the Middle East,

00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:13.530 align:middle line:84%
let's say, we enjoy paying
our suffering forward.

00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:17.340 align:middle line:84%
There's drones killing people
in Afghanistan on my behalf

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:19.050 align:middle line:90%
today, right?

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Those people-- I don't
know if they're with ISIS

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:23.760 align:middle line:90%
or the Taliban or whatever.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.110 align:middle line:84%
But we pay our
suffering forward.

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:31.110 align:middle line:84%
It's our mentality as
opposed to figuring out

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:34.510 align:middle line:84%
what those people want and
what we want and saying,

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.310 align:middle line:84%
how can we make this
a win-win situation.

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:38.370 align:middle line:90%
We're saying, you killed my son.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I need to know that
you know how bad you

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:45.360 align:middle line:84%
made me feel by killing my son,
so I have to kill your son.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.860 align:middle line:90%
That's the Code of Hammurabi.

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.710 align:middle line:90%
That's our entire legal system.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And instead, it's
only going to change

00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.510 align:middle line:84%
when some brave mother-- and
it happens occasionally--

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:59.470 align:middle line:84%
in Israel or
Palestine says, no, I

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:02.340 align:middle line:84%
am not going to pay
my suffering forward.

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:05.720 align:middle line:90%
I am going to choose love.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose
skillful solutions.

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hug
that woman and not

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:15.680 align:middle line:84%
make sure that I make
her feel my suffering.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:19.460 align:middle line:84%
It's absurd when you think about
it, and yet our world functions

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.380 align:middle line:84%
on this notion of
justice, which means

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:23.330 align:middle line:90%
I have to kill your family.

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:24.620 align:middle line:90%
That's insane.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:26.423 align:middle line:90%
So forgiveness--

00:57:26.423 --> 00:57:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's stay on that point.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:31.240 align:middle line:84%
How does that work to a father
that abused you or to others?

00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.040 align:middle line:90%
The same?

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to forgive
them as opposed to sort

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.870 align:middle line:84%
of carrying that suffering
forward and doing it--

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, I know.

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, 100%.

00:57:38.405 --> 00:57:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Instead of carrying
that suffering forward

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.827 align:middle line:84%
and psychologically or
subconsciously abusing your own

00:57:42.827 --> 00:57:43.910 align:middle line:90%
child with that language--

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you cover that as
well before your next point?

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, please.

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.850 align:middle line:90%
So you can't change the past.

00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:54.830 align:middle line:84%
If your parents had
blunt tools, you

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:58.190 align:middle line:84%
have to say they did the best
they could with the tools

00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:59.480 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
understand, there's

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.830 align:middle line:84%
very few parents
who are sociopaths.

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:05.930 align:middle line:84%
They just-- they're going
through their stuff.

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:07.500 align:middle line:90%
They have poor tools.

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they take it out on
our kids in some ways, right?

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:15.410 align:middle line:84%
But for us, our
generation, we just

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:18.850 align:middle line:84%
have to say they did
the best they could.

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:20.930 align:middle line:90%
And as I said, they--

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.630 align:middle line:84%
the real healing comes
when they come to us

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:24.920 align:middle line:90%
at some point in time--

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.450 align:middle line:84%
maybe on their
death bed or-- and

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:30.290 align:middle line:84%
they say, I could
have loved more.

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:33.760 align:middle line:84%
That's when the healing
comes, when you have that

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.530 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] and you
come together and you realize

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that you were part of this thing
and you have a good life now

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and you just have
to accept, really,

00:58:45.050 --> 00:58:48.110 align:middle line:84%
everything that you've
gone through because having

00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:52.010 align:middle line:84%
an adverse relationship with
reality is only hurting you.

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:55.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the insanity
of the human condition,

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:59.720 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness, the mind
trying to change the past.

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Trying to shove that square
peg into a round hole

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:04.790 align:middle line:90%
causes our own suffering.

00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So forgiveness-- and yes,
it's a hard pill to swallow.

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:11.090 align:middle line:84%
If it's too close to the trauma,
if something terrible happened

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:15.410 align:middle line:84%
yesterday, it's hard for me
to be like, OK, I'm going to--

00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:16.880 align:middle line:84%
what do I have to
learn from this?

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:17.990 align:middle line:90%
How did I show up?

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:19.760 align:middle line:84%
How did I bring
this onto myself?

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Why was I there?

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Why did that car
just come into me?

00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And this happened to me
September 4th last year.

00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.790 align:middle line:84%
I was just driving
down the road.

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Someone came across five lanes
of traffic, turned towards me,

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:34.050 align:middle line:90%
hit the gas.

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:35.190 align:middle line:90%
I had brand new car.

00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:36.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a Honda Civic--

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.240 align:middle line:90%
blew the whole thing up, right?

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.638 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting there,
and I had to check--

00:59:42.638 --> 00:59:44.180 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's
people coming over,

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.388 align:middle line:84%
and I had to check to see
if my legs were still there

00:59:46.388 --> 00:59:48.390 align:middle line:90%
because I was not in shock.

00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was conscious.

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.540 align:middle line:90%
But I had the airbag blow up.

00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And have you ever had
an airbag blow up?

00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like being
shot in the chest.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.020 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.490 align:middle line:90%
And it saved my life.

00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:59.900 align:middle line:90%
I'd be dead right now, right?

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.188 align:middle line:84%
So-- but if you're
a small person

01:00:03.188 --> 01:00:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and an airbag hits you in
the face, you're gone, right?

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.345 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a big person.

01:00:06.345 --> 01:00:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The airbag hits me
in the chest, but it

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:09.020 align:middle line:90%
knocks the wind out of me.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:09.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm bruised.

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm all-- there's blood
all over the place, right?

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously I have
PTSD from the car accident

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:19.700 align:middle line:84%
33 years ago, and I'm
just doing this body scan,

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and I'm breathing, and
I'm like, OK, am I--

01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:23.840 align:middle line:90%
will I live through this?

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.150 align:middle line:84%
What is damaged-- like, this
whole thing that's going on.

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
day, the other guy--

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what happened-- had
an epileptic fit or something.

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
He didn't wake up in
the morning and say,

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'm going
to swerve into traffic

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and try to kill some long-haired
Jew at 3:15 this afternoon.

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, he didn't have the
intention of doing that.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.260 align:middle line:90%
So you just have to forgive.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.250 align:middle line:90%
This was an accident.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a car accident.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.510 align:middle line:90%
It's car accident.

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:54.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the language.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:55.790 align:middle line:90%
It's an accident.

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
There's no intentionality
behind it, right?

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.630 align:middle line:90%
These things happen.

01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And whatever can inspire
people to forgive and not pay

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
their suffering forward
is what we need to teach.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:11.820 align:middle line:90%


01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> The first step was--

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Attachment--

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Attachment, then atonement.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Atonement.

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Attunement is-- so
I write in the book,

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
"mirror neurons don't
fire via text message."

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:23.790 align:middle line:84%
We delude ourselves
into thinking

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
we're connecting with other
people through our devices.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.690 align:middle line:90%
We need this.

01:01:27.690 --> 01:01:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So Carl Rogers was a
psychologist in the 1950s,

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and he taught that
psychotherapists

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
create a safe space
to enable clients

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.910 align:middle line:90%
to re-parent themselves.

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.770 align:middle line:84%
So the other component
that's really

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
interesting about parenting
is that if something

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
goes wrong in a household,
whether it's a mother

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
having a migraine or
the parents fighting

01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
or things like that, children,
up until a certain age,

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
assimilate that is there must be
something wrong with me, right?

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So we have this epidemic in
our culture of low self-esteem,

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.700 align:middle line:90%
low self-worth.

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And for me, its
roots are in the fact

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have to figure out
another way of interacting

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
with young people so that they
don't assimilate the world's

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.280 align:middle line:84%
trauma as, if I were perfect,
then mommy and daddy wouldn't

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
have gotten divorced, because
it's just how our minds work,

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And then it shows up
later as I'll only

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.540 align:middle line:90%
be happy when I'm president.

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll only be happy
when I'm married.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.762 align:middle line:84%
I'll only be happy
when I'm divorced.

01:02:42.762 --> 01:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll only be happy--
and this whole thing.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:45.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:46.770 align:middle line:90%
This is what you have.

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:47.970 align:middle line:90%
You have the present moment.

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're not happy
now, I could walk out

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.720 align:middle line:84%
into the street in two
minutes and be hit by a car.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.430 align:middle line:90%
That's my life.

01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:54.910 align:middle line:90%
This is the present moment.

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:55.710 align:middle line:90%
This is a gift.

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:56.310 align:middle line:90%
You have this.

01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:57.180 align:middle line:90%
We're here today.

01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We have enough
food to eat, and I

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.983 align:middle line:84%
get to hang out
with you guys, and I

01:03:01.983 --> 01:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
took a-- you went into
the ocean this morning.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:04.700 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I went to a boxing class.

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:07.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm 53 years old.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I started taking boxing
lessons last week.

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrible.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.310 align:middle line:90%
It's so exciting.

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting because I--

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:16.740 align:middle line:84%
to think, like,
OK, move this hip

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and move this and
breathe out and that's

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.300 align:middle line:90%
this and to learn something new.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.740 align:middle line:90%
I've never boxed before.

01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.060 align:middle line:90%
I bought boxing gloves.

01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:24.900 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrible.

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:27.745 align:middle line:90%
I'm the worst.

01:03:27.745 --> 01:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
There's little people in the
room who could just kill me.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.810 align:middle line:90%
And to me, that's exciting.

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So I like learning, so I'll
put myself in new situations.

01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So attachment,
atonement, attunement,

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.160 align:middle line:90%
connecting with other people--

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
just learning how to
reflect their facial

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.510 align:middle line:90%
affect back to them.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's a weird
thing in our culture.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Some people are taught to smile.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.440 align:middle line:84%
They walk into the room, and
they're like this or something.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But we really have
to carve out time--

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
and it could be in psychotherapy
or it could be with your wife

01:03:57.570 --> 01:04:00.390 align:middle line:84%
or with your kids or
somebody-- where people just

01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
validate your
emotional experience,

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:06.235 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of what goes on
in our society is invalidation.

01:04:06.235 --> 01:04:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not intentional.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.402 align:middle line:84%
But when I go on into Whole
Foods and I'm trying to buy

01:04:09.402 --> 01:04:12.090 align:middle line:84%
something and the kids are
on text message and I'm--

01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:14.392 align:middle line:84%
I'm just sitting
there like, I thought

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
that this was going to
be a loving interaction.

01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:18.683 align:middle line:84%
I need to get this ice cream
and go home and eat it now,

01:04:18.683 --> 01:04:20.748 align:middle line:84%
and you're not paying
attention to me.

01:04:20.748 --> 01:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's these
subconscious things

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that go on that affect us,
whether it's not getting 30

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.440 align:middle line:90%
likes on your Instagram post--

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I just got a buddy onto
Instagram, and he's--

01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
it's, like, three days,
and he's addicted.

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:34.720 align:middle line:84%
He's 60 years old, and
it's like this new thing.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.720 align:middle line:90%
He's like a little baby.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.010 align:middle line:84%
He's like, oh, I only got
eight likes on that one.

01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are
you doing, you know?

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
You're measuring your
life by these things?

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So attuning to other people and
really showing up so that we

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:52.770 align:middle line:90%
cannot feel crazy--

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
because if you just sit
there with your own thoughts

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and don't have the facial
recognition of what we're

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
doing now-- like, right,
wow, that's challenging

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
or, wow, that's really
exciting, you know?

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.860 align:middle line:84%
That makes you feel comfortable
with your own emotional

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:07.860 align:middle line:90%
experience of the world.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's why attunement
is so important.

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And then the--

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we speak on this point
to Marshall Rosenberg's work?

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that you brought
it up because to me--

01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
actually, I found out about
nonviolent communication

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%
through one of my mentors,
Laurentine's godfather, who

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:27.507 align:middle line:84%
got it as part of
a reading book club

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
as part of a Siddhi
yoga group, right?

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>> And so we--

01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I got recommended it.

01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I read it.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.485 align:middle line:84%
And it came at a
really important time,

01:05:33.485 --> 01:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
because in life, you're always
surrounded by people going

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
through challenge, whether it's
your parents, employees, team,

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.810 align:middle line:90%
loved ones, whatever.

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I was being
very unemotionally available

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:51.540 align:middle line:84%
or not as emotionally available
as I could be in the language

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
that I used, in the
way that I listened.

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And this book
changed everything,

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and I think it speaks
to the atonement period

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:03.120 align:middle line:84%
because it helps you
validate and just let

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:05.770 align:middle line:84%
them express their emotions,
and that's part of the healing,

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:06.570 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:07.487 align:middle line:90%
So how does this work?

01:06:07.487 --> 01:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'll say that as a man
we're basically built to fix

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:16.970 align:middle line:90%
shit.

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:19.352 align:middle line:84%
So a woman comes
home and she says,

01:06:19.352 --> 01:06:21.560 align:middle line:84%
oh, this happened and that
happened and this happened

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and then Joan went to the
cooler and then Bob did this

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.640 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And you or I are like, you tell
Joan that-- and you do this.

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And a woman just hears
that as criticism,

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and then you don't
have sex for a month,

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:35.450 align:middle line:90%
and then nobody's happy.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we really need
to teach attunement.

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And for men-- the
Marshall Rosenberg,

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.430 align:middle line:90%
the nonviolent communications--

01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:46.520 align:middle line:90%
it's removing blame.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So you're owning your
own emotional experience.

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that
in a vulnerable way

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
like I did when I
wrote that letter

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to the driver of the car, if
you show up authentically,

01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:00.530 align:middle line:90%
you inspire people.

01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:02.960 align:middle line:84%
If I come-- if we go out
for coffee and I'm like,

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.870 align:middle line:84%
James, I really want you to
be authentic with me today,

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:07.223 align:middle line:90%
you're like, what?

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to show
up and be like, yeah,

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.150 align:middle line:90%
that's a good idea, right?

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But if I sit here and I'm just
like, oh, man, my cat's sick

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and this is a thing and I
show some kind of, like--

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not, like, this whatever--

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.500 align:middle line:84%
it'll hopefully inspire you
to put a hand on my shoulder,

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
show up and just attune to
my emotional experience,

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and then that validates it.

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So the Marshall
Rosenberg I teach as--

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.620 align:middle line:84%
we had in this country,
40 years ago, Mad Libs.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have
that, Mad Libs?

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like this--
you put in words.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.715 align:middle line:84%
There's a blank spot,
and there's sentences,

01:07:42.715 --> 01:07:44.090 align:middle line:84%
but there's blank
spots, and then

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
you put in adjectives
or nouns or things.

01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically "I
feel--" and the blank spot

01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:51.920 align:middle line:90%
is a feeling state--

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.350 align:middle line:84%
"when--" and then
the next part--

01:07:54.350 --> 01:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
the next blank spot
is an observation.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
"I feel frustrated when
there are dishes in the sink

01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:06.050 align:middle line:84%
because I need--" and
then you put in a need--

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:08.390 align:middle line:90%
"I need order in my life.

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.850 align:middle line:84%
In the future--" and then you
put a request in-- "could you

01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
please not have the
dishes in the sink?'

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:17.609 align:middle line:84%
And instead of showing up
at home one night and just

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:20.040 align:middle line:90%
going, dishes in the sink, man--

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:20.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
person's going

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
to be like, well, if
you don't like them,

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.410 align:middle line:90%
then you should do them, right?

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fight.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So you need to have
this language where

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.779 align:middle line:84%
you enroll people in
having a conversation so

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:31.609 align:middle line:90%
that it's a win-win situation.

01:08:31.609 --> 01:08:33.200 align:middle line:84%
People can show
up and they don't

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.790 align:middle line:84%
have to be the bundle
of defense mechanisms.

01:08:35.790 --> 01:08:39.950 align:middle line:84%
They could say, OK, you're
showing up in a loving manner.

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to show up
in a loving manner.

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And let's make this
a win-win situation.

01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:47.569 align:middle line:84%
So I-- all those tools, the
reflective listening, Harville

01:08:47.569 --> 01:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Hendrix, Imago,
nonviolent communications,

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Marshall Rosenberg,
and some of the things

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
from John Gottman's book
on the "Seven Principles

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.410 align:middle line:84%
of a Highly
Successful Marriage,"

01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:58.819 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff--
any time you can

01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
change your way of
phrasing something--

01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give you
my favorite one.

01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:06.500 align:middle line:90%
And this one is--

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%
this one goes to the
forgiveness aspect also.

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:11.899 align:middle line:84%
But someone taught me
years ago-- they said,

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:15.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, try this phrase
out with this person

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.779 align:middle line:90%
you're having a fight with.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Please forgive me
for not understanding

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.819 align:middle line:84%
the way you choose to
show your love for me.

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:25.620 align:middle line:90%


01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you shut
up indefinitely.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.479 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically-- it's
called a pattern interrupt,

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.700 align:middle line:84%
because the person
expects you to blame them.

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you say to
them, I know you

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.850 align:middle line:84%
love me and you want
what's best for me,

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:46.350 align:middle line:84%
but that really hurt my
feelings, that phrase--

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
particularly if you're having
some kind of contention,

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:52.620 align:middle line:90%
something acrimonious--

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
if you can say,
please forgive me

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:56.667 align:middle line:84%
for not understanding
the way you're

01:09:56.667 --> 01:09:58.500 align:middle line:84%
choosing to show your
love for me right now.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:02.460 align:middle line:90%


01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Again, we need to find--

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:09.740 align:middle line:84%
we need to elevate our
discourse so that we inspire

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:12.182 align:middle line:84%
the other person to show
up in a loving manner

01:10:12.182 --> 01:10:13.640 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
we really want.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But, instead, we
do this crazy thing

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
in our society, which
I call-- it's yes but.

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:22.160 align:middle line:84%
So in my family
where I grew up, I

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.885 align:middle line:84%
would say, look, the
sky's blue, and then

01:10:25.885 --> 01:10:28.520 align:middle line:84%
my grandma would be, yeah, but
it's going to rain tomorrow.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.810 align:middle line:84%
So-- I know, but that's--
because we're taught to try

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:34.880 align:middle line:90%
to arrive at the truth.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But what we inadvertently do
with these phrases like "yes

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
but" is we invalidate the other
person's emotional experience.

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So I had this one
person at Esalen,

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and she had a
younger sister who--

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:52.580 align:middle line:90%
it's such a beautiful story--

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:57.560 align:middle line:84%
who hadn't found her way
yet and was kind of just

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:59.200 align:middle line:90%
flopping about the house.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell already
that the way the older sister

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
was showing her love for her
was like, you should get a job.

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:09.372 align:middle line:90%
You should go to school.

01:11:09.372 --> 01:11:10.580 align:middle line:90%
You should do this, whatever.

01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And the girl was just
thinking, I'm a piece of shit,

01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.893 align:middle line:84%
I'm a piece of shit, I'm a piece
of shit, I'm a piece of shit.

01:11:14.893 --> 01:11:16.640 align:middle line:90%
So I told her to say--

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I told her, for the next
week, don't say "yes

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:24.320 align:middle line:84%
but" whenever your younger
sister says anything.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Just change it to "yes and."

01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And I got to call
a week later, and--

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:31.970 align:middle line:90%


01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that's the smallest thing,
just taking one word, "but,"

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and changing it to "and,"
and it just totally

01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:41.180 align:middle line:90%
transformed the relationship.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Marshall's fantastic.

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:44.070 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.660 align:middle line:90%
And what does he say?

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.090 align:middle line:84%
He says, don't put
a butt-- don't throw

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:46.970 align:middle line:90%
a butt in front of a jackal.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.830 align:middle line:84%
You know how he does little
animals and everything?

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, it's fantastic.

01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:51.368 align:middle line:84%
>> And I find I'm
doing it as well.

01:11:51.368 --> 01:11:53.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've got a
new 13-year-old son.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And he'll be like,
oh, look at that,

01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to prove
my intelligence to him.

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but this and
that and this and that.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, huh?

01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:03.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a wake-up call, but it's--

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I love being triggered--

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.170 align:middle line:84%
now I love being
triggered because I

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
get to see my own stupidity
and, in that process,

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:12.702 align:middle line:90%
grow from that awareness.

01:12:12.702 --> 01:12:14.327 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to tell
you a funny story.

01:12:14.327 --> 01:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
This is so embarrassing.

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I was on a date with someone who
I really wanted to go on a date

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.460 align:middle line:90%
with.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I had met her 30 years ago.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And her father's one
of my all-time heroes,

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and it just-- it was
very exciting or whatnot.

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:30.230 align:middle line:90%
And we sit down to dinner.

01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And for some-- because I
had to puff up my chest

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:35.640 align:middle line:84%
because I am proud of the book,
you know, and all those things.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.440 align:middle line:90%
So I was just--

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.130 align:middle line:84%
I nonchalantly-- she
knew I wrote the book,

01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:40.850 align:middle line:90%
but I nonchalantly mentioned it.

01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, did
you self-publish it?

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And the date went tits
up, and it was awful.

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:53.140 align:middle line:90%
And for the next hour--

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize this
till after the fact,

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:59.020 align:middle line:84%
but I was trying
to justify my own--

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
because I took it
as such a slight,

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and she probably didn't
mean it like that.

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
She didn't wake up in
the morning and say,

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:04.630 align:middle line:84%
you know what I'm
going to do tonight?

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:05.547 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to mess up--

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw a monkey
wrench into Ira Israel's engine

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.460 align:middle line:90%
by asking this question.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
If she had said,
who's the publisher,

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't have affected
me like that at all.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.248 align:middle line:84%
But it put me on my hind
legs, and I was like--

01:13:16.248 --> 01:13:18.040 align:middle line:84%
because she could make
a phone call and get

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.890 align:middle line:84%
a book published in a second
because of her family.

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:24.680 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it basically took
15 years to get a publisher,

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:25.480 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was just
like this-- it was

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
this hierarchical, subconscious
thing that happened.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.237 align:middle line:90%
I'm so embarrassed.

01:13:31.237 --> 01:13:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to just
call her and say, like,

01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:35.260 align:middle line:90%
can I have another shot?

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:38.650 align:middle line:84%
I was just put into
my pain body by you

01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:40.370 align:middle line:90%
asking this innocuous question.

01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
meant to slight me.

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.600 align:middle line:90%
A lot of famous people--

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Stephen King
self-published his books.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I'm so proud that
I actually had a publisher

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's Eckhart Tolle's
publisher and I'm-- whatever.

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But the way the
question was phrased--

01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:55.420 align:middle line:90%
and it's so interesting.

01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.040 align:middle line:90%
You know, no one's immune.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.070 align:middle line:84%
You just have to really sit
there and tune in to the person

01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:02.998 align:middle line:84%
and think about, what
are they really saying?

01:14:02.998 --> 01:14:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And then when we're
speaking, we have

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to be very conscious of
the way we phrase things.

01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
So then the last
part-- attachment,

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
atonement, attunement,
presence, and congruence.

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:15.970 align:middle line:90%
So presence is really simple--

01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:17.860 align:middle line:90%
yoga, meditation.

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Depression relates to
thoughts about the past.

01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety relates to
thoughts about the future.

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:23.710 align:middle line:90%
The past doesn't exist.

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:24.790 align:middle line:90%
It's dead and gone.

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:26.330 align:middle line:90%
The future doesn't exist.

01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:28.100 align:middle line:90%
It's just your expectations.

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So how do depression
and anxiety exist?

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So being in the present moment
and not allowing the prejudices

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
from the past to influence your
decisions or your expectations

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.970 align:middle line:84%
or fears about the
future to influence

01:14:44.970 --> 01:14:49.210 align:middle line:84%
is essential to authentic,
loving relationships.

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
part is congruence.

01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:51.705 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we do that?

01:14:51.705 --> 01:14:52.810 align:middle line:90%
How do we meditate?

01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
To be present in
a relationship is

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to listen well, to not solve
women's problems, which

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm horrible at.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I get the list of
problems, and I'm solving them.

01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're going
to book this flight.

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:02.980 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do this.

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:03.590 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do that.

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:04.370 align:middle line:90%
We're going to meet this person.

01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do-- it's
just like, no, just listen.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Understand the emotion.

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:09.700 align:middle line:90%
It's profound, and it solves it.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
You're like, whoa,
that's amazing.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:12.030 align:middle line:90%
How did that problem go away?

01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It screws with a guy's brain,
right, because he-- yeah.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> A guy is so practical.

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:17.892 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I first started
getting insight into this

01:15:17.892 --> 01:15:20.078 align:middle line:84%
through David Deida, his
work, and he was just like,

01:15:20.078 --> 01:15:21.870 align:middle line:84%
they want to hug and
they want to be heard.

01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and the
nonviolent communication

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:24.670 align:middle line:84%
was sort of the
book end of it where

01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:26.253 align:middle line:84%
it was like, OK,
that makes sense now,

01:15:26.253 --> 01:15:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you tools
to listen better.

01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Being present-- OK, so you
can do that through listening,

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.090 align:middle line:84%
like you've spoken,
atonement, being

01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:35.590 align:middle line:90%
attuned to the other person.

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But you're speaking
about meditation now.

01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:40.990 align:middle line:84%
What practice of
meditation do you use?

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Is it mantra based?

01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Is it sitting in stillness?

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Is it guided
visualization or whatever?

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:47.650 align:middle line:90%
What do you prescribe?

01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
works best for people?

01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> There are seven point some
odd billion people on planet

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
There are seven points some
odd billion different types

01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:58.990 align:middle line:90%
of meditation.

01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
For me, mantra
meditation gets me high.

01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
That's-- and I go to various
gurus, and I'll sit with them.

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:12.700 align:middle line:90%
And I don't advocate--

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that the archetype
of guru is functional anymore.

01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:18.940 align:middle line:90%
But there are certain people--

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I sit in their
presence-- that's what

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
the word "Upanishad" means,
and I love the Upanishad.

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just sitting
in the presence.

01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:27.400 align:middle line:90%
And I feel happy.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.140 align:middle line:84%
When I sit with the
Dalai Lama and I

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
know what he bears and to
see his joy and the way

01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:40.330 align:middle line:84%
he's turned that around and
his love, I'm so inspired.

01:16:40.330 --> 01:16:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Like I-- you know, that--

01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:44.230 align:middle line:90%
so I always seek out--

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
whether I go to MOCA and look
at Rothkos or go to the symphony

01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and watch Gustavo
Dudamel conduct "Mahler."

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
All these people, all these
artists, all these writers

01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:58.690 align:middle line:84%
are seeking the same
thing in some ways, right?

01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:01.312 align:middle line:90%
So for me, I constantly--

01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:04.480 align:middle line:90%


01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm hungry for how
other people found

01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:11.950 align:middle line:84%
meaning in their
lives, constructed

01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
loving relationships
and things like that.

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I practice
mantra meditation.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But I teach
visualizations because I

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
want people to disidentify
with their thoughts.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.850 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give a visualization.

01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the most common is
the Buddhist one where you're

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:36.490 align:middle line:90%
sitting at the edge of a river.

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a tree off to
the side and a leaf falls

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:41.860 align:middle line:90%
and whatever thoughts you have--

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
oh, I hope I didn't
get a parking ticket.

01:17:43.810 --> 01:17:45.735 align:middle line:90%
You put it on the leaf.

01:17:45.735 --> 01:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And you have something
called a mind screen, right?

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And you watch the leaf
go down the stream.

01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And when the leaf exits your
mind screen, what you'll notice

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:56.217 align:middle line:84%
is another thought
comes into my head.

01:17:56.217 --> 01:17:58.300 align:middle line:84%
What am I going to have
for dinner tonight, right?

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And then you put it on.

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of
that meditation,

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll say, point to
the part of your body

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:09.730 align:middle line:90%
that was watching your thoughts.

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And some people point here, but
in Tibet, mind or heart-- mind

01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:15.310 align:middle line:90%
is here, right?

01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:20.800 align:middle line:90%
So all of our beliefs--

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.560 align:middle line:84%
as I started this conversation
with Thomas Kuhn--

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.600 align:middle line:90%
can be deconstructed.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the matter
is that Descartes put us

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
on the wrong thread or path
when he said, "I think,

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:34.510 align:middle line:90%
therefore I am."

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:37.330 align:middle line:90%
We're addicted to thinking.

01:18:37.330 --> 01:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And our thoughts
are causing us--

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.997 align:middle line:84%
they're encapsulating
the problems.

01:18:42.997 --> 01:18:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they're saying,
no, that's not a problem.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.455 align:middle line:84%
You suffer from
bipolar disorder.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:47.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:48.730 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:18:48.730 --> 01:18:56.980 align:middle line:84%
You're responsible for your
own cognition in some ways.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:02.080 align:middle line:84%
If you're unhappy, think
better thoughts, right?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- but that's
what the gratitude list is.

01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So being present, for me, means
cultivating non-reactivity.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:14.043 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting there,
and you're thinking--

01:19:14.043 --> 01:19:15.460 align:middle line:84%
you're not actually
thinking this,

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
but you're like, oh, you
know what happened today?

01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:17.790 align:middle line:90%
I woke up.

01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:21.730 align:middle line:84%
There was $125 charge on a
Shell station on my credit card,

01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that I didn't go
to that Shell station, right?

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go through
this whole thing,

01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and my card was
obviously stolen.

01:19:30.250 --> 01:19:32.200 align:middle line:84%
There's all these tricks
that people do now.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.098 align:middle line:84%
But it was really interesting
to see the way I was like, OK--

01:19:35.098 --> 01:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I was just like, OK, this is
going to suck about a half

01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:38.230 align:middle line:90%
an hour of my life.

01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:39.917 align:middle line:84%
I just have to
figure out how to--

01:19:39.917 --> 01:19:42.500 align:middle line:84%
what's the most efficacious way
of canceling this credit card?

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:43.910 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, you just--

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:44.710 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

01:19:44.710 --> 01:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
You just-- you accept that
these things happen, and you--

01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:48.370 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:49.840 align:middle line:90%
It's over, you know?

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So when you sit there
in the morning--

01:19:52.450 --> 01:19:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and I like to sit there.

01:19:53.740 --> 01:20:07.980 align:middle line:84%
What that does is it lets you
taste the nectar of the divine.

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So yoga and meditation
were devised

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to help you go to the other
side of your thoughts.

01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Deepak Chopra calls it
falling into the gap,

01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:22.970 align:middle line:90%
the gap between words.

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're
addicted to language.

01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:26.690 align:middle line:90%
We're addicted to thinking.

01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And we have to be able to--

01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:32.655 align:middle line:84%
my favorite quote
from Marshall McLuhan

01:20:32.655 --> 01:20:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is, "I don't know
who discovered water,

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.750 align:middle line:90%
but I doubt it was a fish."

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So we're swimming in this
language and these emotions

01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and capitalism and our way
of being in the world and all

01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
these things, and
they're contributing

01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:54.470 align:middle line:84%
to our stress and our
anxiety and as us showing up

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:58.100 align:middle line:84%
like assholes and being
revengeful and starting

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.930 align:middle line:90%
wars and these things.

01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:07.688 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be able
to sit there and just

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:16.050 align:middle line:84%
tap in to what's underneath
all that craziness.

01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I sit
in the morning,

01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:22.103 align:middle line:84%
and then when my credit
card gets stolen or someone

01:21:22.103 --> 01:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
cuts me off on the
road or someone

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
gives me the wrong
change, I don't

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:32.670 align:middle line:84%
have to be insane and show up
in some way that's only going

01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:34.320 align:middle line:90%
to exacerbate the situation.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I can say, oh yeah, my
credit card got stolen.

01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:37.260 align:middle line:90%
It happened for.

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:38.490 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen again.

01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I have to spend half an hour on
the phone with Chase cancelling

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:43.080 align:middle line:90%
the credit card.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Not going to ruin
my life, you know?

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.380 align:middle line:90%
And I did it.

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But we're very
reactive, and so we

01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:52.470 align:middle line:84%
have to cultivate
non-reactivity,

01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:55.273 align:middle line:84%
which is an art form, so
that we're not triggered

01:21:55.273 --> 01:21:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and that we learn
what our triggers are.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So observing our
thoughts, you sit there.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And Dan Harris has
that beautiful quote.

01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
He says, "Meditation's
like being kidnapped

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.360 align:middle line:84%
by the most boring
person on Earth,"

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
because if you sit there for
a half an hour in the morning,

01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:13.400 align:middle line:84%
you realize that your mind
has a default mechanism.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Mine's planning.

01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And Sharon Salzberg
says, "My mind

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
plans because it
makes me feel safe."

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.320 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it's a Jewish thing.

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But planning-- like,
OK, I have this list

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do
this at 8 o'clock

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and this happens
tomorrow morning.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm making my
universe orderly.

01:22:33.810 --> 01:22:35.190 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

01:22:35.190 --> 01:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not going to
give myself my own diagnosis.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think I plan because
there was a part of my life

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.400 align:middle line:90%
where I was not in control.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And my mindset--

01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to
let that happen again.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.230 align:middle line:90%
So my mind plans.

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly-- so now when I
have people come into my office

01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:55.063 align:middle line:84%
and they have OCD,
I'll sit them down

01:22:55.063 --> 01:22:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and I'll do a little
meditation and I'll

01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:02.610 align:middle line:84%
say, OK, this behavior that
you're now calling whatever

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:05.500 align:middle line:84%
you're calling, at
some point in time,

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
it was a solution to a problem
for your seven-year-old mind

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.060 align:middle line:84%
or your nine-year-old
or your 10-year-old mind

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:16.590 align:middle line:84%
thought, oh, if I just binge
and purge, then x will happen.

01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I solved the problem.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Now you're 35.

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:20.120 align:middle line:90%
You're bingeing and purging.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.430 align:middle line:90%
You're unhealthy.

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what your mind
was trying to solve then.

01:23:25.770 --> 01:23:27.720 align:middle line:84%
For me, the narrative
that I've constructed

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
is, when I was in
traction, it was

01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:31.440 align:middle line:84%
kind of humiliating
to have to have

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
somebody do the bedpan
and all these things.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And my mind said, I'm going to
never let that happen again,

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:40.682 align:middle line:84%
so I'll create order in my life
by making lists and planning

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:41.640 align:middle line:90%
and doing these things.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And then when I'm sitting there
meditating and I catch myself--

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.560 align:middle line:90%
and it's insane.

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.223 align:middle line:84%
You just realize
that this is, like--

01:23:48.223 --> 01:23:50.640 align:middle line:84%
the world's going to show up
the way it's going to show up

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.240 align:middle line:90%
no matter what I plan, right?

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.950 align:middle line:90%
But my mind makes--

01:23:55.950 --> 01:24:00.040 align:middle line:84%
it feels this sense of ease by
having these-- like, OK, well,

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
if this happens, that'll
happen, and then I'll do this

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:03.390 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll say this.

01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have these
fictitious conversations.

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I look at myself
having these conversations that

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:09.510 align:middle line:90%
are never going to take place.

01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:10.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, this is insane.

01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:11.662 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you just go meditate?

01:24:11.662 --> 01:24:13.500 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
lot more pleasing.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I get back
to the meditation.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me, we're
cultivating non-reactivity

01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:20.880 align:middle line:84%
because we have this
default mechanism,

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.440 align:middle line:90%
this way of being in the world.

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.860 align:middle line:84%
We're always
preparing for things

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to
do things and whatnot.

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And we just have
to be able to be

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
in the present
moment as our highest

01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:39.420 align:middle line:84%
self without the influences
from our society and all

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:44.100 align:middle line:84%
these crazy desires that
we think will make us happy

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:44.920 align:middle line:90%
if we attain--

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and just.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:49.770 align:middle line:90%


01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Was that the last one?

01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> No, the last
one is congruence,

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and it starts with this
beautiful quote by André Gide,

01:24:56.370 --> 01:25:00.300 align:middle line:84%
who said, "It is better to be
hated for what you are than

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to be loved for
what you are not."

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So for me, again,
congruence is a privilege

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.440 align:middle line:84%
to live in such a
WEIRD wealthy society

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
where you and I get to say, I
want to be a psychotherapist,

01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and I go to school, and I
become a psychotherapist,

01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and I am able to earn my
living helping other people,

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:22.990 align:middle line:90%
or I want to be a writer.

01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you create your
life around your vocation.

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So "voco" in Latin
means calling, right?

01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is giving
us information all the time.

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to
sit down and meditate

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:39.010 align:middle line:90%
and say, what does this mean?

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you use your best
inferences to say, oh,

01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't be working
flipping pizzas.

01:25:46.770 --> 01:25:50.010 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And then you create your
life so that you can do that.

01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I hope
that my classes and my book

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and the DVDs and
everything inspire people

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
to do, because anything
that you do for money,

01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:04.530 align:middle line:90%
you're a prostitute, right?

01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And in our country,
all my friends,

01:26:06.490 --> 01:26:07.740 align:middle line:90%
they have golden handcuffs.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm 53 years old.

01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:12.270 align:middle line:84%
If you started working in
1988 when you were my age,

01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:14.670 align:middle line:84%
you make millions
of dollars a year.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of my friends
who feel, oh, well, my kid--

01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:21.750 align:middle line:84%
this costs this much, and
the mortgage costs this much.

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:22.650 align:middle line:90%
They hate their jobs.

01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:23.490 align:middle line:90%
They hate their lives.

01:26:23.490 --> 01:26:24.323 align:middle line:90%
And they're trapped.

01:26:24.323 --> 01:26:26.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what a golden
handcuff is, right?

01:26:26.610 --> 01:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So at some point
in time, you have

01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:31.440 align:middle line:84%
to sit down and say, what's
going to make me happy,

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and figure it out and find
your vocation, your calling.

01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:38.520 align:middle line:84%
What is the universe telling
you that you should be doing?

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:41.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's not making money.

01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not exerting
power over people.

01:26:44.650 --> 01:26:45.720 align:middle line:90%
It's being of service.

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
It's being your nature,
which is Buddha nature, which

01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:51.750 align:middle line:90%
is pure love, you know?

01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Show up that way.

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Inspire other people to do that.

01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And let's make the
world a better place.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.530 align:middle line:84%
What would be your
sort of message

01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:03.600 align:middle line:84%
for the people
listening to this,

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.450 align:middle line:90%
watching this, hearing from you?

01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:08.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've got a very
unique range of studies.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But if there is some
sort of final message

01:27:13.050 --> 01:27:15.740 align:middle line:84%
you want to leave for people,
I'd love to hear that now.

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:22.330 align:middle line:90%


01:27:22.330 --> 01:27:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Abraham Maslow has
this incredible quote.

01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:28.670 align:middle line:84%
He says, "When the only
tool you have is a hammer,

01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:31.240 align:middle line:90%
every problem resembles a nail."

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So I've been very
privileged post car accident

01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:40.930 align:middle line:84%
to travel around the
world and go to ashrams

01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and sit with really,
really smart people,

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and I've aggregated
a set of tools.

01:27:48.490 --> 01:27:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And I know the ones
that work for me,

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:54.460 align:middle line:90%
and I don't proselytize.

01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:56.920 align:middle line:90%
What I do is I share tools.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.692 align:middle line:84%
And I say, why
don't you try this?

01:27:58.692 --> 01:27:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you try that?

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you try surfing?

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:01.670 align:middle line:90%
I've never surfed in my life.

01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll send people to
surfing lessons, you know?

01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But I know the things
that resonate with me

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and make me happy, and
I love sharing them

01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:14.690 align:middle line:90%
with the people I love.

01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But when students
or patients come in,

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I have to meet them
where they're at.

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.760 align:middle line:90%
And I really--

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of proud of
that in some weird way,

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:25.840 align:middle line:90%
because I don't--

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
you go to these
meditation classes,

01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and people are inflicting
types of meditation.

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, there's seven
billion people on the planet.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has to find
what works for them.

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And we should
realize that that's

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:42.130 align:middle line:84%
a privilege because
we're not worried about,

01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:45.100 align:middle line:84%
am I going to live
through the rest of today?

01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:46.810 align:middle line:90%
That's an amazing privilege.

01:28:46.810 --> 01:28:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Most human beings that
walk the face of the Earth

01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:52.850 align:middle line:90%
never reach the age of 40.

01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:56.022 align:middle line:84%
So every day that I
wake up at 53, I'm like,

01:28:56.022 --> 01:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is gravy, man, or
this is great, you know?

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, it's so
funny to me-- gratitude.

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
When I was 40 years
old, I bought a Vespa.

01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:08.682 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
psychological story about this

01:29:08.682 --> 01:29:10.390 align:middle line:84%
because my parents
forbade me to have one

01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:12.850 align:middle line:84%
because someone
else in the family

01:29:12.850 --> 01:29:15.400 align:middle line:84%
had gotten killed when I
was quite young, right?

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:16.570 align:middle line:90%
But when I was 40--

01:29:16.570 --> 01:29:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and again, I wanted to
re-parent myself, right?

01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:20.320 align:middle line:90%
So I bought-- and I just--

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.050 align:middle line:90%


01:29:23.050 --> 01:29:24.700 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like
what I said before.

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I started boxing lessons
last week, you know?

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:30.250 align:middle line:90%
But that novelty, you know?

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:32.545 align:middle line:84%
And I learned how to
ride a motorcycle.

01:29:32.545 --> 01:29:34.600 align:middle line:84%
I got my motorcycle
license, all these things.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And in Santa Monica, there's
these manicured streets

01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:41.980 align:middle line:84%
with palm trees, which are
not indigenous to California,

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:43.690 align:middle line:90%
but there's these beautifully--

01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:47.230 align:middle line:84%
like, Paris is the intentional
city laid out by housemen,

01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
perfectly structured.

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.130 align:middle line:84%
You can see from
one end to the other

01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and through this
monument and that tower.

01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:54.340 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Santa Monica, I mean,
it's so beautiful.

01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know if people
who live here realize it.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.800 align:middle line:90%
There's trees of pine street--

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.600 align:middle line:90%
there's streets of pine trees.

01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.800 align:middle line:84%
There's streets of
palm trees and whatnot.

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.950 align:middle line:90%
So for me, when I--

01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:12.850 align:middle line:84%
coming here, riding my Vespa
down these beautiful streets,

01:30:12.850 --> 01:30:15.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like, this is amazing.

01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:18.130 align:middle line:84%
This is amazing that
I get to do this.

01:30:18.130 --> 01:30:20.413 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could've
been killed 33 years ago.

01:30:20.413 --> 01:30:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I could be killed yesterday.

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I could be killed
this afternoon.

01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Just me with my face and
the wind coming across it

01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and just looking at
this beautiful thing

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.815 align:middle line:84%
and the blue sky, I
mean, it's a miracle.

01:30:32.815 --> 01:30:37.240 align:middle line:90%


01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Ira.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited for as
many people as possible

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.450 align:middle line:90%
to hear your incredible message.

01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thanks for
allowing me the opportunity.

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And yeah, you're a gentleman
and a scholar and you've got

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.407 align:middle line:84%
a lot of important things
to share in this world.

01:30:51.407 --> 01:30:52.740 align:middle line:90%
So I appreciate your time today.

01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Same to you.

01:30:53.550 --> 01:30:54.383 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:30:54.383 --> 01:30:57.380 align:middle line:10%
