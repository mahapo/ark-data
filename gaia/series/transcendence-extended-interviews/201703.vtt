00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.690 align:middle line:10%
And today, we're going to be
talking about a topic that

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.260 align:middle line:10%
deeply affects us all,
and yet rarely comes

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.580 align:middle line:10%
onto the discussion table.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is about the depth
and the connection of our love

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:90%
and intimate relationships.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:90%
My guest today is Arielle Ford.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:84%
She is a leading
expert in this space.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.900 align:middle line:84%
She's authored over 11
books on this topic,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.720 align:middle line:84%
including the bestseller
Soulmate Secrets."

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Arielle, hello.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, how are you?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So this sort of arena,
relationships, love

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and connection, we
know it's so important.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet, very few of us
delve into its depths.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.715 align:middle line:10%
I don't suppose you came at this
from an academic perspective.

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:47.773 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.773 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there was probably
some personal story that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:90%
kicked it off for you.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.582 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell me about it?

00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was not predictable
on any level that I would turn

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:84%
into a love and
relationship expert.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a home
with two parents who

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:84%
absolutely hated each
other, fought all the time.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Thank god they got divorced when
I was 16, because it was just

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:90%
a nightmare.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was a very late
bloomer when it came to love.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:90%
I was a first-time bride at 44.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that I had
anything against marriage.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
I just wasn't focused on it
until the day that I was.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I woke up one morning,
I was 43 years old,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't even
have my eyes open yet.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of feeling
around the bed looking

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
for my 25-pound cat.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And the cat wasn't there.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:10%
But what I noticed
was that there was

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:10%
this huge empty expanse of bed.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:10%
And I thought to
myself, oh, my god.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:90%
I forgot to get married.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking about,
how did I get to be 43,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:90%
never married?

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:90%
I had this great life.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Everything was good.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that all my
time and energy and attention

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:90%
was on building my business.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.665 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, I was really

00:01:58.665 --> 00:02:01.040 align:middle line:84%
good at manifesting all the
right things for my business.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I can manifest a soulmate.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So I took everything
I knew from--

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
we didn't call it
love attraction back

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:90%
then, but manifesting--

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and within six months, I
manifested the most perfect guy

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
I call him my heart
chakra on legs.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:90%
And we met.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks after we
met, we got engaged.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.430 align:middle line:84%
A year after that we
had three weddings.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:10%
And we've now been
together 22 years.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, that's pretty cool.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.197 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't happen
to most people.

00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
want to talk about

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
is that you know,
in Bronnie Ware's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
"Five Regrets of the
Dying," one of the top

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
regrets that people
have is that they didn't

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
have deep intimate connections
with people in their lifetime,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't keep them
for a long period of time.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And yet, relationships
can be the source

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
of so much pain and so
much positive energy.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
How have you sort of grown
to understand the power

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:90%
of relationship in your life?

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, after I got married,
I quickly discovered that I had

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:90%
no partnership skills.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the skill
that I was the best at

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
was being the boss, which
I found out very fast

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
doesn't work when you're
with a masculine alpha male.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So I made myself
a student of love.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find out well,
how could I be a good partner,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and what is marriage really
about, and how does love work?

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I took this deep
dive and did a lot of study.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered
is first, most people

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.110 align:middle line:90%
have no idea what love is.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, they think
love is a feeling.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Oh, James, I feel
like there's champagne

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:90%
going through my body.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:90%
I love you so much.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So what that is, is the
world's greatest drug high.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And your brain is emitting
tons of chemicals, oxytocin,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and adrenaline, and
dopamine, and it's

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:90%
just a great drug high.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
It's actually nature's trick
to get us to procreate,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:90%
to keep the species going.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.190 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't last.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't really love.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:90%
It's lust.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
It's connection.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It's passion.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's not what real love--
real adult mature love is.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.570 align:middle line:84%
What real adult mature love
is, is first and foremost,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:90%
it's a behavior.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a decision.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:90%
It's a practice.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:90%
It's an action.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a way of being.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And so while you and
I could be soulmates,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and we could have all these
great wonderful feelings,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:84%
there will be days when
you hate me and I hate you.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:90%
And that is totally normal.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
But most people start
thinking about divorce.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:90%
Something's wrong.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.482 align:middle line:84%
If you were really my soulmate,
you would love and accept me

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:84%
for exactly who I
am, and you would

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
know exactly what
I want and need

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and give it to me all the time.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of not
what it's all about.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple
of people you'll

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:84%
hear me quote a lot
today, because I

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:90%
didn't originate this material.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I just digested it and
shared it with the people

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:90%
who most want it.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So at the University
of Washington,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
there's a man named Dr. John
Gottman who is the world's

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:90%
leading marriage researcher.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
He's had a thing called "The
Marriage Lab" for 50 years.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And what he discovered is
that every couple-- not just

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.180 align:middle line:84%
some of them-- every couple
has a minimum of nine

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:90%
irreconcilable differences.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So the most common
one is money--

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:90%
one's a spender, one's a saver.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:84%
One's always on time,
one's always late.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
One wants it hot,
one wants it cold.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
One wants sex three times a
day, one wants it once a month.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And we live like it
shouldn't be this way.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's normal.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.580 align:middle line:84%
What isn't normal
is to leave somebody

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.510 align:middle line:84%
you say you love because
they're always late.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So the solution becomes
finding creative solutions, not

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
compromises, because
that's a win-lose,

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:90%
but a creative solution.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I invented for
myself was something

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:90%
that I call wabi sabi love.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So in Japan, there's an old
aesthetic called wabi sabi.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And in wabi sabi,
they seek to honor

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:84%
all things old, worn,
imperfect, impermanent.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking to
find beauty and perfection

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:90%
in imperfection.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I learned about
it, I thought, wow,

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:84%
what if I applied that
to my relationship?

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:84%
What if I could
look for the beauty

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and perfection in
my own imperfections

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:90%
and in your imperfections?

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
you're not demanding

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:90%
that your partner change.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have a
conversation with your partner.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you an example.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So when Brian and I
got together and we'd

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.868 align:middle line:84%
been married a short time, one
day I found myself like this--

00:06:48.868 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember what
I was doing it about,

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.310 align:middle line:90%
but I was like--

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:90%
and I stopped.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
please, forgive me.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm really sorry.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:90%
This will probably happen again.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And the next time it happens,
could you just kindly gently

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.398 align:middle line:84%
say to me, when did
Sheila enter the room?

00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, Sheila's my mother's name.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.950 align:middle line:90%
And I love my mother.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:90%
But she's a very bo--

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I got to be bossy
by watching her.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And he got it instantly.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And he started laughing.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I get too
patronizing, you

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
can call me Wayne,
his father's name.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So by utilizing wabi
sabi, we found a way

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
to prevent World War III,
make fun of each other,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:90%
and just reframe the situation.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that I
have found works really well.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.685 align:middle line:84%
If you're-- let's say
you're the late person,

00:07:40.685 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:90%
and I'm the on-time person.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I could be constantly
berating you.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you just be on time?

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:90%
It's so rude.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:90%
It's so unkind.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.480 align:middle line:84%
What would work
better if I could say,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.037 align:middle line:84%
here's the reason I need
you to either be on time

00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
or let me know when
you're going to be

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:90%
late is because I get anxiety.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
When you don't show
up, I go into this

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:84%
you know, negative feedback
loop where I think, oh, my god,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:90%
did he get in a car accident?

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Did he have a heart
attack and drop dead?

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So I just can't
exist in the world

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.180 align:middle line:90%
when I'm worried about you.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you know that,
you could say, oh, well,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't want Arielle to worry.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:18.220 align:middle line:90%
I am running late.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Let me just send her a text.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way to work
through the differences,

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the
differences are normal.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I've read about your
wabi sabi concept.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a unique
and fabulous family,

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:34.090 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful wife.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:90%
I love her dearly.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.190 align:middle line:84%
We've been together a long time,
14, 15 years married this year.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
have differences.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But we've found fun
ways to play with it.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But on the wabi
sabi perspective,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:90%
I've got two boys now.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I get
irked about things

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:84%
that they do-- leaving
stuff around or doing this,

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:84%
because I'm quite
organized in my life.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.318 align:middle line:84%
But then I think, if
they weren't here,

00:08:56.318 --> 00:08:58.360 align:middle line:84%
those things wouldn't be
there and I'd completely

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.235 align:middle line:90%
miss them in my life.

00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:01.895 align:middle line:84%
So I've learned to see them
as clues of my love for them.

00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And you spoke about that I
think with the dishes example.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Was that right?

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell me that, because
I think people would really

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:90%
relate to that.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so there was--

00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
the woman's name.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's call her Mary--

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and Mary married a
man who had three

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:90%
teenage college-aged kids.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.170 align:middle line:90%
She didn't have any children.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And they would come home
from college or high school

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.407 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and they'd
all get in the kitchen

00:09:24.407 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:90%
and cook together.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And the kitchen would become
this big ugly, dirty mess.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And rather than
celebrating the family fun,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
she would start to
have panic attacks.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And when she looked
deeper into it,

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
she realized that she had
grown up with a bipolar mother

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and that when the kitchen
was clean and spotless,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:90%
it meant mom was OK.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And when the kitchen
was dirty and chaotic,

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:90%
it meant bad times were coming.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So once she got to
understand the wabi sabi-ness

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
of her own family, she could
sort of separate her childhood

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
from the reality that
this messy kitchen now

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
meant she had a lot
of love in her life.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And I use it frequently, because
one of the irreconcilable

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:84%
differences between myself and
Laurentine is she has a messy

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
cooker, and I'm a
clean-as-you-go guy.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, by the time the
meal's on the table,

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:90%
it is spotless in the kitchen.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And I love it, and I can eat--

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.298 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm the messy
one in our family.

00:10:19.298 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And Brian came from a
clean kitchen household.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know, years ago I
remember every morning he

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.010 align:middle line:84%
would come into the
kitchen, and he'd say to me,

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:84%
why is your coffee
cup still in the sink?

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.790 align:middle line:90%
The dishwasher's right there.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you just
put it in there?

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd say,
and why are there

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.215 align:middle line:90%
crumbs around the toaster?

00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, what crumbs?

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't see any crumbs.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:84%
This went on for
like six months.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:43.887 align:middle line:84%
And it got to the
point, every time

00:10:43.887 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I saw him walking towards
me, I'd think, oh, shit,

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.890 align:middle line:90%
what did I do now?

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And then one morning
he came in the kitchen

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and he had this silly
grin on his face.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's going on?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.583 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I got up
in the middle of the night

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:90%
to get a glass of water.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I saw your coffee
cup in the sink.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I saw the crumbs
around the toaster.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And I fell even more
in love with you.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's like huh?

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
He said, I realized you
just don't see these things.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And since I'm the one
who's bothered by it,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I am promising you I will
spend the rest of my life

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:90%
cleaning up after you.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so sweet.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.120 align:middle line:90%
That's so sweet.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And the opposite side of that
is that he's a youngest child.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm an oldest child.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So his core wound
is being heard.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, being listened to is
the most important thing

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:90%
in the world to him.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'm the
world's worst listener.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But we've gotten to
a point now where

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
sometimes he'll say to me,
you're not listening to me.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And then he'll stop
and he'll laugh

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:90%
and I go, oh, that's my issue.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And other times I'll go,
oh, no, you're right.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:90%
I drifted.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:51.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Would you forgive me and
repeat what you said?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So there are ways to
take what's normal

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and natural, which is
tension, and find a way

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.152 align:middle line:90%
to own it and take care of it.

00:12:04.152 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's
really beautiful.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
That's such a mature
approach, right?

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Because I do see people
rushing to this like,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.140 align:middle line:90%
it's never going to work.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's finish it up.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
This is impossible
for us to resolve.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me give you some
frightening stats about

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:90%
it's never going to work.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
it's like in Australia.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But in the United
States, everybody

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
knows that 50% of first
marriages end in divorce.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.870 align:middle line:90%
That's just a fact.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
What nobody knows is that
62% of second marriages

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and 71% of third
marriages end in divorce.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so leaving doesn't
solve the problem.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not like you're
marrying the same person

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
The same person is you showing
up over and over again,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:90%
not knowing how to be a partner.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So marriage is not
for children, OK,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
because you have to learn
emotional management.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn great
communication skills.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing
to stay in the fire

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:84%
when it's burning
hot, even though you

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be there.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but the
other side of it is

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that you get to spend your
life with your lover, your best

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.290 align:middle line:84%
friend, your
biggest cheerleader,

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
your partner for life,
your safe place to land.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And the cost of that
is paying attention.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
I really want to go to
family of origin stuff.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Family?

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Family of origin stuff,
so like, as children.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Because in a lot of
the work that we've

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
been doing more recently-- so as
we sort of progress from health

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and happiness and fulfillment,
we sort of learn everything

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
from our environment
when we're young.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And so if we've been in
relationships or witness

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
to relationships
that haven't thrived,

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:84%
can you talk to
me about how sort

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
of belief systems
about relationships

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that we might
develop as children

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.450 align:middle line:90%
manifest as we get older?

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And how we can sort of develop
an awareness of some of those--

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's really
a simple answer.

00:13:58.982 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
When you were a
little boy, did you

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
believe in Santa Claus
and the Easter Bunny?

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:90%
You did, right?

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you grew up, and you
went, oh, that's not real.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Let me have a new belief.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, oh, maybe now
I believe in hard work

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:84%
and earning my way
through the world.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
being willing to become

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:23.280 align:middle line:84%
an emotionally mature adult. OK,
so my parents didn't get along.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:90%
They hated each other.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The mantra I heard out
of my mother's mouth

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:90%
forever was, all men are idiots.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
That was what I grew up
with-- all men are idiots.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I grew up to
discover that's not true.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But for the early
years of my dating,

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.622 align:middle line:84%
I lived like all
men were idiots.

00:14:38.622 --> 00:14:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to
say, wait, I'm not really

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:90%
having a lot of fun here.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that guy
graduated from Harvard Law

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:90%
He is not an idiot, you know.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I need to change.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So we have to be willing to
look at our belief systems

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and question them and do what
my old friend, Wayne Dyer,

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:84%
always said, which
is so brilliant.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.355 align:middle line:84%
He said, don't believe
every thought that you have.

00:15:01.355 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.313 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that to me is one of
the most genius things ever.

00:15:06.313 --> 00:15:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Just because you're having a
thought doesn't make it true.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Just because you think--

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm sure you
have never woken up--

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:90%
what's your wife's name?

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Laurentine.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Laurentine, OK.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever woken up in the
morning thinking to yourself,

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what I could do today
to make Laurentine crazy?

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.390 align:middle line:90%
No, of course not.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:90%
And she hasn't done that.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wakes up in
the morning thinking,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
how can I make my mate
or my spouse crazy.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we live
as if that's true.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%
We react to them like,
why do you always--

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, like they're
doing it intentionally.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.345 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I recently learned--

00:15:41.345 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:84%
we have a woman
on the radio here

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.820 align:middle line:84%
for 30 years named
Dr. Laura Schlesinger.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've heard of her,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
but she's a famous
love advice person.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was listening
to her recently,

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and some woman was
whining and moaning

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:90%
about something her husband did.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And she said, imagine just
in this moment that you

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:90%
were his defense attorney.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
What would you say to the
jury about his behavior?

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:10%
How would you defend him?

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And she was like, well, I
know that when he was younger

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:90%
this and that happened to him.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And he still has a
little PTSD about it.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he can't
handle such and such.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:90%
And it just shifts everything.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, what if we could be
all in with our partner?

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to love them,
the good, the bad, the ugly,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:84%
the stuff we like, the
stuff we don't like,

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
their defense attorney.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be their warrior,
their spiritual warrior,

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.730 align:middle line:90%
their love warrior.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
How would that shape
the rest of your life?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.675 align:middle line:90%
>> In a profound way.

00:16:40.675 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean it would help you to see
multiple sides of the equation.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And don't you want
to be seen that way?

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Really, we all want
the same basic things.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:84%
According to
Maslow, we most need

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:84%
physical and emotional safety,
and then food, air, water,

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and we want to be
loved, seen, and heard

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:90%
for exactly who we are.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:90%
We want to be accepted.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't want
your spouse's happiness

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
as much as you want
your own happiness,

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:84%
then you probably
shouldn't be married.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, you don't have
to be married, you know.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:84%
But if you're on
a spiritual path,

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:84%
there's no better fast track
to enlightenment than marriage.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Or having children,
or adopting children.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I've adopted recently.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:10%
And I've got an instant
13-year-old boy, which is fun.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> That's super challenging,
because once he feels safe,

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
he's going to act out his whole
history to see if you're going

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.375 align:middle line:90%
to love him anyway.

00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, and there's
nothing more than you can do.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And tell him every single day,
no matter what you've done

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:84%
or what you're doing,
you are loved here.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, we may not like
it, and you may get punished,

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.010 align:middle line:90%
but you are loved.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And there won't be
enough hours in the day

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.217 align:middle line:84%
for you to reinforce
that message.

00:18:02.217 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming to that realization.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.050 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that is true when

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
it comes to health and
happiness and well-being

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.575 align:middle line:90%
is a quality of relationships.

00:18:12.575 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But not just intimate
marriage relationships.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about community,
the sense of community.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.780 align:middle line:84%
You look at the blue
zones, for instance.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.655 align:middle line:84%
As long as there are
people around the world,

00:18:19.655 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
yes, it's what they
eat a little bit.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:90%
But not really.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:90%
They drink wine.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:90%
They have long lunches .

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.898 align:middle line:84%
They do all sorts
of random things.

00:18:25.898 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:84%
But they live in
multigenerational homes.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:90%
They live in communities.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:90%
They connect.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
They have this strong sense of
relationship in their lives.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
I feel like in the
modern Western world,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:84%
we've sort of divided
up our families.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:90%
We've divided up our culture.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:90%
We've got fences everywhere.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:84%
We ship off old people
into old people's homes.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when we die, we're
like oh, I miss everybody.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's the
number one regret.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.320 align:middle line:84%
How do we deepen
the relationships,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.433 align:middle line:84%
not just with
ourselves, but with all

00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
of the people around
us in our community

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:90%
or our friends or our family?

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And is that ever the
same tools that you

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
use in intimate
relationships to do that?

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's
the same intention.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, you first
have to say you know,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not willing to not
have these people in my life.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, like how can I
open my heart, open my arms,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.553 align:middle line:84%
open my home to bring people in,
to be the gatherer of my tribe

00:19:19.553 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:90%
and to share that with them?

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:84%
Because really, the biggest
social sickness in the world

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:90%
right now is loneliness.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
People are literally
dying of broken hearts.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:84%
They're just so
isolated and lonely.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And with social media, it's
even worse, because then you

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
get to see oh, look, they're
out with their grandchildren.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:90%
They're out with their kids.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.020 align:middle line:90%
They're having a family reunion.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Somebody just went to a wedding.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And here I am in my
little studio apartment,

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
75 years old, all by
myself, not feeling great.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And next door or
the floor above you

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.838 align:middle line:84%
there could be somebody who
could say, hey you know,

00:19:55.838 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:84%
we're having a family
dinner tonight.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you join us?

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But it requires
awareness and really

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:90%
willing to extend yourself.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And given how busy people
have gotten, it's impossible.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you know,
right now there's

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:90%
this whole sandwich generation.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:90%
So you've got kids.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:90%
You have aging parents.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
You have money
pressure, work pressure.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we're living in the
field of planet Earth, which

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:90%
has never been more turbulent.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're
meditating twice a day,

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
you're still
absorbing the stress

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and the turbulence
of everybody else.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And most the time, you
don't recognize it.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So you may not have a
lot of personal stress.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.053 align:middle line:84%
But you're still going to be
stressed out, because we're

00:20:38.053 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:90%
living in the field.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way to
disconnect from the field.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing you sort of
touched on a little bit I think,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:52.450 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like to maybe ask it in
a different way is people have

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
emotional traumas or things
that they've gone through

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And then when we come
into a relationship

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.880 align:middle line:90%
and we feel safe enough.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Then we start sharing, right?

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Then we start unpacking
these emotions of my dad

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:90%
do this to me or this happened.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Are relationships a good
place to help each other heal

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:84%
from these types
of emotion, or not?

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Or should they just be kept
to the psychiatrist's office?

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.580 align:middle line:10%
>>Well, Harville Hendrix, who
is the other world's leading

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:23.540 align:middle line:10%
marriage expert, believes
that soulmate marriage--

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:10%
the whole purpose of it is to
heal your earliest childhood

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:10%
wounds from your caregivers.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:84%
That you're to be in
the safe container

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
where it is safe and
allowed for this to come up

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:90%
to heal each other.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
I have with what's

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
happening in the
self-help world right

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.820 align:middle line:84%
now is there's this huge amount
of people teaching self-love.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they show
up at my workshops

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.895 align:middle line:84%
on how to manifest
a soulmate, and they

00:21:49.895 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
don't want to get
started, because they

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:84%
have this whole story--
well, until I love myself

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.650 align:middle line:84%
I can't manifest a soulmate
I don't love myself enough.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like, oh,
it's so crazy making.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Here's what you need to.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
The minute you're
with your soulmate

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and you see how much love
they have for you reflected

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:84%
in their eyes, there's
no faster, deeper

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:90%
healing than being loved.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.802 align:middle line:84%
Because if your core wound
is you don't love yourself,

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:90%
you're never getting over it.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We never get over
our core wounds.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:84%
What we do is if we do
enough deep work, is

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.630 align:middle line:84%
we learn how to mitigate
the negative parts

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:90%
of the core wounds.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:90%
We know how to live.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.300 align:middle line:84%
We can tap, do Sedona
method, do heart lock-ins,

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:90%
meditate, exercise, hot yoga.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a million ways to
mitigate the discomfort.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:84%
But your core wound
is your core wound.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.990 align:middle line:84%
You're going to die
with your core wound.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you're waiting to
oh, I love myself so much

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.420 align:middle line:84%
now I'm ready for love,
you're going to die alone.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm telling everybody,
if you have a deep desire

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to have a partner, there
are 7.8 billion people alive

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:90%
on this planet right now.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:90%
And half of them are single.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:84%
There are no shortage of
conscious potential partners

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:02.540 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
The only thing missing is you
being willing to be visible

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.290 align:middle line:90%
and to make an effort.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I got deep into the
work of David Deida

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
at a certain point
in my journey,

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
because in every evolution
of the relationship

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
there's things to
understand and work on.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:25.438 align:middle line:10%
And one thing I found
fascinating from my learnings

00:23:25.438 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:10%
there, at least one
take away from me

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:10%
is that he described a little
bit more about the feminine

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:10%
to me, because I wasn't
taught that by my father.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.030 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't taught it by my mother.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:84%
They have their
own relationship.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And I aspire to
something different.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.393 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that the feminine
will say things or do things

00:23:45.393 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:90%
that they don't always mean.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.318 align:middle line:84%
But the masculine
takes it literally

00:23:48.318 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:90%
and they're like, really?

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you mean?

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:51.200 align:middle line:90%
It's over.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.827 align:middle line:84%
And it was a real struggle
for me in my masculine,

00:23:54.827 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
because I would bring
my notebook out,

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:90%
all right, what's your problem?

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'm going
to solve them for you.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.076 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
women want, right?

00:24:00.076 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you explain that to me?

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I've learned this now,
and I feel grateful for it.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We also did some of his
workshops and found it really

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:90%
valuable.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, men
are very focused.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.610 align:middle line:84%
You basically don't
want to ask them

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:84%
two questions in
the same breath,

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:90%
one question at a time--

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:84%
question A, answer,
question B, answer.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.880 align:middle line:84%
They go on a direct line and
they love to solve problems.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:90%
They want to be your hero.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I tell women all
the time, men are

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.140 align:middle line:84%
so easy if you understand
how their brains work.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
All they want to
do is please you.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And they actually can't be
happy unless you're happy.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Women on the other hand, we can
digest multiple things at once.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:90%
We can be very diffused.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm
looking over there.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Oh, she is beautiful shoes on,
and god, that's a cute curl

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.320 align:middle line:90%
in his hair.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.945 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder what
I'm having for lunch.

00:24:50.945 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And all this is happening
at the same time.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And then a storm comes in, and
we're pissed off or, we're PMS,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
or we're having something
and we get angry and bitchy.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
well, what's wrong?

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:03.833 align:middle line:90%
And there's nothing wrong.

00:25:03.833 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just a storm
moving through.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Just let us go.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.098 align:middle line:84%
You know, I remember when
Brian and I first got together,

00:25:11.098 --> 00:25:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I'd come home from work
and he'd say, well,

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:84%
where do you want to
go to dinner tonight?

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most upsetting
question in the world.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I had just spent the whole
day making decisions.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.300 align:middle line:84%
The last thing I
wanted to do is figure

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:90%
out what I wanted for dinner.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So finally, we got
to a point where

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
he would say one of two
things, either, I've

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.540 align:middle line:84%
made an executive decision and
we're going to A for dinner,

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
or would you like A, B, or C
for dinner, which was perfect.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Then I could just choose.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Then I could lean back
into my feminine energy

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and receive his
direction, you know?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:84%
But we're not taught
this anywhere,

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:84%
which is why we had to take
the David Deida workshops,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
because we met, we started
a business together,

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.650 align:middle line:90%
we got married.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.542 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we're
talking business 24/7.

00:25:56.542 --> 00:25:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I remember we'd be out to
dinner at 8 o'clock at night,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and he'd start talking to
me about a certain contract.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'd have this really like--

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I would just go
like that inside.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I don't
want to talk business.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.047 align:middle line:90%
And he'd say, well, why not?

00:26:09.047 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:90%
It's fun.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.033 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know why not.

00:26:12.033 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned
that, you know,

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:84%
when I'm in business
mode, I'm in my male head,

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.310 align:middle line:84%
testosterone-driven, solving
problems, making stuff happen.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.110 align:middle line:90%
And it was fun and I enjoyed it.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But at night, I just wanted
to be in my feminine energy.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to stop thinking, stop
choosing, and just sort of lean

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So once we understood
each other better,

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.290 align:middle line:84%
we were able to set boundaries
and you know, he understood me.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:90%
I understood him.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're at a point
where it's just a dance.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's just a flow.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not like-- because he is
a very masculine guy, but very

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:90%
comfortable in his feminine.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very comfortable
in my masculine

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and have to remind myself
to get into my feminine.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've gotten to a point
where it's just a good dance.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that you and Brian
have a lot in common with

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:90%
myself and Laurentine.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.490 align:middle line:90%
We've done business together.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.405 align:middle line:84%
She's very practically
strong in her masculine

00:27:07.405 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and needs to be reminded to
get into feminine every now--

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.373 align:middle line:84%
and I'm comfortable
in my feminine

00:27:11.373 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:84%
as much as I am in
my masculine as well.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And it is a dance.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:16.990 align:middle line:84%
One thing-- and I
don't know if this

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is something you've
sort of specialized in,

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:21.820 align:middle line:84%
but it's something I'm
intrigued in from a relationship

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
perspective is a lot of
relationships start passionate,

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.445 align:middle line:84%
and then they end
up contractual.

00:27:29.445 --> 00:27:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They end up like all right,
you drive the kids to school.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.580 align:middle line:90%
I'll do this.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll do that.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:90%
And then there's no passion.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:90%
There's no hot sex.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:90%
There's no intimacy.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there's not
really many places

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.780 align:middle line:84%
where we're taught how
to cultivate intimacy,

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.190 align:middle line:90%
how to create that.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.150 align:middle line:84%
How important do
you think that is?

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, is exercise
important to you?

00:27:51.198 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:90%
And you make it a habit, right?

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a priority.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, reviving romance
needs to be a priority.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So that would mean that once a
week you have a designated date

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
night where you don't talk
about the schedule of who's

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.740 align:middle line:84%
driving which kids to what
soccer practice, right?

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that keeps the
hotness of a relationship alive

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.427 align:middle line:90%
is novelty.

00:28:12.427 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So you don't go to the
same restaurant every week.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:90%
And you don't do the same thing.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:21.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the fastest
ways to spark passion

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:90%
takes a little bit of planning.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So they've done these studies
where they showed that--

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.880 align:middle line:84%
what's something that you know
your wife would be terrified

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to do, like jumping out
of a plane or bungee

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.490 align:middle line:90%
jumping or a roller coaster?

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> All of the above.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and is there any one
of those that you would be

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.840 align:middle line:90%
terrified of?

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.477 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, which one?

00:28:40.477 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Jumping out of a plane.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you two decide that
you are going to jump out

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:90%
of a plane together.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.240 align:middle line:90%
You go and you do it.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.440 align:middle line:84%
You are going to have a shared
adrenaline rush, because you're

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:84%
now doing something
that you both perceive

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.900 align:middle line:90%
as life threatening.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's going to be big.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:84%
When you land, you
get in your car

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and drive to the nearest
motel and have really hot sex.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.753 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
this is that there's--

00:29:05.753 --> 00:29:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
the name for it--

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.980 align:middle line:84%
but there's an
actual name for it

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that when you survive a life
threatening incident together,

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.050 align:middle line:90%
you deeply bond.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll give you a
real-life example of this.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Do you know Christie Brinkley
is-- very famous model--

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.450 align:middle line:84%
American model, blonde, she
was married to Billy Joel,

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:90%
the entertainer for many years.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.720 align:middle line:90%
Then she got divorced.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Then she met this real estate
developer named Ricky Taubman.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And on their third
date they went

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to Aspen to do
helicopter skiing.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And the helicopter crashed
and they both lived.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And they got married
the next week.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, they were divorced
three months later.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But they totally
bonded over that.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So a way to really
respark passion

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:84%
is to scare the shit
out of each other.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:90%
That's one way to do it.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.822 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting, so interesting.

00:29:55.822 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I could take
her heli skiing.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Although she's a
better skier than me,

00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:84%
so that would probably
just cross me.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, it could just be
as simple as a roller coaster

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
or whitewater river rafting,
just something where

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
you're both going to
have an adrenaline rush.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And then don't rush
home, rush to some--

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that's the other thing,
getting out of the house.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're in
your house and she's

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.760 align:middle line:84%
looking at the ceiling
and oh, my god,

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.710 align:middle line:84%
there's a tear in
the curtains and did

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I hear one of the
kids in the room?

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.840 align:middle line:84%
This is why vacation sex tends
to be better than home sex,

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.170 align:middle line:84%
because you need to have
just the two of you.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>> What is this-- there's this
feathering the next concept

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:90%
question there.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so it's for singles.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It's about a way to
prepare your home.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, how does that work?

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so when you're
feathering the nest,

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:84%
you're getting your home
ready to receive your beloved.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:84%
You're telling the
universe that I literally

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:53.180 align:middle line:84%
have space in my life to
receive somebody into my home.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing to do is
to clear out all the clutter.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of feng shui 101.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of the clutter.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:84%
You want to get rid of any
photos, mementos, or souvenirs

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:06.668 align:middle line:84%
of you with an ex
in Corfu or wherever

00:31:06.668 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that are going to start
a conversation that isn't

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:90%
going to go somewhere great.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.020 align:middle line:84%
You want to make sure
that in the bedroom

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:84%
that if you have a bed that
you shared with your ex-husband

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:90%
or ex-wife, get a new bed.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.470 align:middle line:84%
If you can't afford a new
bed, at least get new linens.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that the nightstand
on both sides of the bed

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.160 align:middle line:84%
are of the same height and that
the nightstand on their side

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.200 align:middle line:90%
of the bed is totally empty--

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.060 align:middle line:90%
nothing and it, just empty.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that one drawer
is empty for their clothes.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Make some space in the closet.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Give them half a shelf
in the bathroom cabinet.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:84%
If you have a two-car garage
and you've been parking

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.410 align:middle line:90%
in the middle, move over.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.690 align:middle line:84%
All of these are subtle
signs to the universe

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.900 align:middle line:84%
that I am open, willing,
and available for someone

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.410 align:middle line:90%
to come into my life.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're
certain they're never

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.930 align:middle line:84%
going to live in
this place with you,

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
it's still a good idea
to go through this

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.390 align:middle line:90%
and sort of set the stage.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.010 align:middle line:90%
I have room for you in my life.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
feathering the nest is.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I really like that.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:90%
That's so sweet.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.813 align:middle line:84%
And it's so weird that
Laurentine and I, we're quite--

00:32:13.813 --> 00:32:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I find quite an interesting
and unique couple.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.293 align:middle line:84%
We feel that we've
been able to grow

00:32:17.293 --> 00:32:18.460 align:middle line:90%
a lot together and continue.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But our origins where I used
to go to sea on ships and work

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.620 align:middle line:84%
ships, and I would pray for
somebody that I could spend

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.930 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my life with
and I could share my life

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:29.770 align:middle line:90%
experiences with.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.312 align:middle line:10%
That was my biggest
wish and desire--

00:32:31.312 --> 00:32:34.090 align:middle line:10%
someone that I could be with
from now until forever and we

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:10%
could go, remember that time,
or remember this, or remember--

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:10%
And so I was really
deeply at that time,

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:10%
not knowing what I was
doing-- in a way manifesting.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.100 align:middle line:90%
It was more prayer-based for me.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.080 align:middle line:90%
You know, just before--

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, if I thought
this would happen.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:84%
She was cutting out
literally, a vision board

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
of this one picture
of-- it happened

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.720 align:middle line:90%
to be a Hugo Boss model.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny that our first
child's called Hugo now.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't realize
that until later.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But they're all
different looking models.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
that I look like him.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But I looked very
much like this guy,

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.330 align:middle line:84%
like the same chin, the same
jaw line, a similar type face,

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.512 align:middle line:90%
same short hair, same thing.

00:33:08.512 --> 00:33:10.970 align:middle line:84%
We pulled that photo and I was
like, oh my god, Laurentine,

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:84%
you cut that photo
out before you met me?

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.632 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, yeah, I put
that on my vision board.

00:33:16.632 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:90%
So you know, you never know.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:90%
I think there's power in that.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, no, I knew one
woman who was an artist.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.660 align:middle line:90%
She was a painter.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And she painted this
picture of this man.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And then three weeks later,
the man in her painting

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:84%
showed up and is
now her husband.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you never know
how the universe works.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't need
to understand it.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:90%
We just need to enjoy it.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, true.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's one or
two other things here.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Health benefits of being in
love and having relationships.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's been
studies done which are known

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.960 align:middle line:90%
as the marriage effect.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered is
that couples who are happily

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:55.030 align:middle line:84%
married live longer, happier,
more satisfying lives,

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and they experience
much less physical pain.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.010 align:middle line:90%
So this is proven.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:03.640 align:middle line:84%
They have not been able to prove
that it's true for couples who

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:90%
are in love but not married.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.620 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, actually
taking sacred vows

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.570 align:middle line:90%
ensures the marriage effect.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.280 align:middle line:84%
The other piece of
it that they found

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.489 align:middle line:84%
is that married men, whether
they're happily married

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:16.659 align:middle line:90%
or not--

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:18.639 align:middle line:84%
married men live
seven years longer

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:22.179 align:middle line:90%
than divorced or single men.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Seven years-- now, women don't
live any longer that way,

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.409 align:middle line:90%
but men get--

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.210 align:middle line:84%
so if you're a single
or divorced man

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and longevity is important
to you, you need a partner.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that's because
they're hanging around making

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:84%
sure they don't cheat
on somebody else?

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I think it's more that--

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.350 align:middle line:84%
part of it's the emotional
and physical safety

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.150 align:middle line:90%
of having a partner.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And you know, most men, the last
time they have a physical exam

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.040 align:middle line:84%
is in high school until
they're in their 40s

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.909 align:middle line:90%
and they have a real problem.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.449 align:middle line:84%
But if you're married,
especially if you have kids,

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:58.180 align:middle line:84%
your wife is not going to
let you not go to the doctor,

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.580 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
responsibility to her

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:90%
and the kids to stay healthy.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So there is built-in
safety factors for men

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:84%
that women bring that men
won't do on their own.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's sweet.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Controversial question
before I get to the last one.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe in
the idea of monogamy

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:84%
as the cornerstone of
the modern relationship?

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've done all
the tantra workshops.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to people about
polyamory, non-monogamy versus

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.520 align:middle line:90%
monogamy.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I've
observed is that if--

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.380 align:middle line:84%
for most people, if you
want to have a committed,

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.830 align:middle line:84%
long-term happy life,
monogamy is the way to go.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some people
that agree that they

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:90%
can each be non-monogamous.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be
working for them.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.953 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I've never
seen work, ever is polyamory.

00:35:51.953 --> 00:35:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
you're trying to have

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:84%
multiple emotional
relationships.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
two people choose

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.880 align:middle line:84%
each other over the
third or the fourth

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and then jealousy just naturally
erupts and things fall apart.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I know that the
younger generation is really

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.120 align:middle line:90%
into experimenting.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I
say to all of them

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:15.820 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm so grateful that I'm
from the baby boom generation,

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up in an era
where sex couldn't kill you,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and you could trust
your drug dealer.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.593 align:middle line:84%
And none of those
are true today.

00:36:25.593 --> 00:36:27.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean
really, they just

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.130 align:middle line:84%
found out that Lyme disease
is sexually transmitted.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:34.260 align:middle line:84%
There's so many dangers
to having unprotected sex

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, that you really
have to be focused.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you fall in
love and you see

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:40.810 align:middle line:84%
someone you want to
spend your life with,

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:44.230 align:middle line:84%
why would you want
to risk killing them?

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.608 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really, it's that risky.

00:36:47.608 --> 00:36:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know
very married men

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.535 align:middle line:84%
that walk around with
condoms in their wallet.

00:36:52.535 --> 00:36:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I'm
at the whole thing.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.410 align:middle line:84%
That's just based
on observation.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:57.550 align:middle line:90%
And I don't judge people.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.090 align:middle line:84%
You know, do what
you want to do.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I'm
all in, you know?

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm not cheating.

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:04.960 align:middle line:90%
He's not cheating.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's a great
sense of security

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:84%
in knowing that you
can trust your partner.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, I love that.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Final question--
do you think that

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:84%
powerful intimate relationships
have the capability to change

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:90%
the world and the planet?

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.525 align:middle line:84%
Because I love these really
grand concepts of like,

00:37:25.525 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:90%
how do we change the world?

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.030 align:middle line:84%
We'll become more conscious
through our children

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.308 align:middle line:84%
and help them not have too
many limiting beliefs when

00:37:30.308 --> 00:37:32.350 align:middle line:84%
they grow up so they can
be compassionate and not

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:84%
racist, and connected and open
and loving and heal the world

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and solve the environmental
problems, right?

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.230 align:middle line:90%
That's one idea.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.358 align:middle line:84%
But being a specific
relationship expert,

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:42.400 align:middle line:84%
do you believe that deep
loving relationships can

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.200 align:middle line:90%
save the planet?

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:44.820 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell, particularly
single women that are

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.002 align:middle line:84%
like afraid to date or they
don't want to go online--

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.960 align:middle line:84%
but you know that that's
their biggest desire--

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and I said listen,
don't do it for you.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Do it for me.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, because the world
has never needed

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.710 align:middle line:90%
love like it needs love now.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And my husband came up
with a mathematical formula

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:06.190 align:middle line:90%
around all of this.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:90%
He calls it soulmate math.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.580 align:middle line:10%
In regular arithmetic,
1 plus 1 equals 2.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.690 align:middle line:84%
In soulmate math,
1 plus 1 equals 11,

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:20.110 align:middle line:90%
and your love blesses the world.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.617 align:middle line:90%
>> That's super sweet.

00:38:21.617 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Anything else you
want to finish with?

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Anything we haven't finished?

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Anything that's still open?

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Any study or anything
that you think

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:30.190 align:middle line:84%
is interesting
about relationships?

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, OK-- so there's
a lot of resistance,

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.390 align:middle line:84%
particularly on the part
of women on online dating.

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I tried it.

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.290 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work for me.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell them,
yes, you tried it,

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't know
how to do it right.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.630 align:middle line:90%
And so you just want to give up.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, I just want
to meet somebody organically.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Here are the most
recent statistics.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:54.280 align:middle line:84%
40% of marriages
now begin online.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.570 align:middle line:84%
OK, and the divorce rate for
people who meet and marry

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:02.370 align:middle line:90%
online is under 10%.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can have your
whole story and you

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.710 align:middle line:90%
can die alone if you'd like.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Or you can go to the
world's greatest cocktail

shopping party and you know,
like Amazon Prime one click,

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:90%
you can start clicking away.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
becomes a numbers game.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:20.530 align:middle line:84%
You just have to find the
one that you connect with.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.890 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful to chat.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And you've enlightened
me more deeply

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:84%
about how to be more conscious
in my relationship as well.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Just be a defense attorney.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, for the other person.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>> And I love that.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I know, when I
heard her say that--

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.260 align:middle line:90%
because she's--

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I'm just
grappling with that now.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.142 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if we've got
something going on, well,

00:39:41.142 --> 00:39:44.745 align:middle line:84%
how can I see that maybe what
she experienced as a child

00:39:44.745 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:84%
or what she witnessed could
be contributing to that

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and that it's not
her fault really?

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And it probably isn't.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, if your
7-year-old falls and skins

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.380 align:middle line:84%
his knee and starts
to cry, you're

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.010 align:middle line:90%
not going to beat him up.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.810 align:middle line:90%
He's got a wound.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.435 align:middle line:84%
The difference is
we're grown up adults

00:40:00.435 --> 00:40:02.320 align:middle line:90%
and you can't see our wounds.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.820 align:middle line:90%
But they're there.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it's
interesting to say well,

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:90%
I just want to fix you.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.300 align:middle line:84%
But maybe really,
all you need is a hug

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.250 align:middle line:90%
and you just want to be loved.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, this is coming
up for you again.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, my core wound is
poverty consciousness.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I've
worked on it forever

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's manageable
to a certain degree.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.420 align:middle line:84%
But when I get into
this contractual thing,

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Brian just reminds me,
everything's going to be OK.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
all I need to hear.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no reality
to the fear that I'm

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.210 align:middle line:90%
having, none whatsoever.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, but I contract
into this thing that's

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:84%
partly because I was raised
Jewish so it's in my DNA

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:43.760 align:middle line:90%
that there's never enough.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's drilled
into you early on.

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And then there's just this
idea of, what is enough?

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And then being heard
is what heals it, right?

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, no, just instead of
somebody like reacting to you

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:02.750 align:middle line:90%
just saying, oh, tell me more.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.350 align:middle line:90%
You know, just tell me more.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
else you need to say?

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>> It's beautiful.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.
