00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Aloha.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm Ocean Ramsey.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm a shark and marine
conservationist,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.830 align:middle line:84%
a marine biologist,
competitive-level freediver,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and professional
scuba instructor,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:90%
kind of general athlete.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.180 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of sports.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm outdoors a lot.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I work in the field
in marine research.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So that puts me in close
proximity to whales, dolphins,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and especially sharks.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Sharks are the focus of
my work, both in research

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:90%
and my passion in conservation.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I feel so lucky to
get to spend time

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
with over 30 species of
sharks around the world.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's really fueled my
voice to speak up for them,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:84%
because I have these incredible
experiences with them,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and I realize that so
many people don't actually

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:90%
know the truth about them.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:90%
They're very afraid of them.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's absolutely incredible
to get to introduce people

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
to sharks so that they get to
see what they're really like.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I find that actually
sharing this knowledge,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:84%
the scientific information,
and my personal firsthand

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
experiences and
observations with people

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.660 align:middle line:84%
helps them to overcome their
fear, kind of take the plunge,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and get out there
and experience life

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy their
life so much more.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing
quite like overcoming a fear

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and feeling that empowerment,
because I feel like,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:84%
for some people,
fear is a big burden,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and fear is very
blinding for people.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And sharks are actually being
wiped out off the planet.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:84%
They're being brought to
the brink of extinction

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
because people are
so afraid of them.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Because people are
so afraid of sharks,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:84%
they don't know the truth,
that sharks are being killed

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:90%
for just 5% of their body--

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.305 align:middle line:84%
just their fins--
for a bowl of soup.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:90%
It's called shark fin soup.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a Chinese delicacy.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's not nutritious.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.370 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very high
in toxins and mercury.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.548 align:middle line:90%
So it's bad for your body.

00:01:59.548 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
It's bad for your health.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It's terrible for
the environment,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:90%
'cause we all rely on sharks.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
They're like the immune
systems of the ocean.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
They pick off the dead, dying,
weak, sick, injured animals,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and they keep lower
trophic level populations

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.710 align:middle line:90%
healthy and in balance.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:90%
So we need sharks.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Everyone relies on the ocean
for the air that they breathe,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and most people rely on it for
their primary protein source.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But again, with all the
runoff and human chemicals

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
going into the ocean,
there's a lot of toxins

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:84%
now, a lot more than
there used to be.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you're eating
higher up on the food chain--

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:84%
like if you were to
actually eat a shark--

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:84%
those toxins are compounded
with every trophic level.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you get to
an apex predator,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.210 align:middle line:84%
they're the most concentrated
that you can possibly get.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So again, to
emphasize to people,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
don't eat shark fin soup
because it's bad for you,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
but also because it's
bad for the environment.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Because sharks are
apex predators,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.135 align:middle line:90%
they're slow to reproduce.

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
They have long
gestation periods,

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
and they pup few young.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
They're not a
sustainable fishery.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:84%
That means that
you can't continue

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:84%
to fish them in high numbers,
like they're being killed right

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
now, and expect that their
populations can keep up

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.150 align:middle line:90%
with that demand.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And again, for conservation,
how do we combat this?

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:90%
How do we empower people?

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:90%
How do we overcome this?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.208 align:middle line:84%
And it's just spreading
awareness, spreading knowledge.

00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
My work in marine conservation
and shark conservation

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is really important to me,
because sharks have basically

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
given me the best
moments of my life--

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.440 align:middle line:84%
whales, dolphins, just having
these incredible moments

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:90%
interacting with these animals.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:90%
And they give me so much.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And my way of giving
back is sharing my voice.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a voice.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And humans really do impact
these animals every single day

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:90%
in very small ways that add up.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And these cumulative impacts
are absolutely devastating

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:90%
to marine ecosystems.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
If you think of,
like, a plastic straw,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.200 align:middle line:84%
a single-use plastic
straw, you use it one time

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:90%
for maybe five minutes.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you throw it
away, it doesn't go away.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, these
single-use plastics

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
make it out into
the ocean, where

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
they can entangle, strangle,
suffocate, and eventually

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
lead to death, sometimes in
very terrible, slow ways,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:84%
with sea turtles, marine birds,
dolphins, sharks, whales.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much, I've
seen human impacts

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
on every type of marine
life I've encountered.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.635 align:middle line:84%
And that's devastating
to me, because I

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:36.260 align:middle line:84%
realize how incredible
they are and how

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:90%
incredible that environment is.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And I want more
people to know that.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm trying to,
again, share my voice

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and utilize any type of
technology, media, science,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
programs, art,
anything that I can

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:90%
to get that information across.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
I find that the more ways
and times that I can practice

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
self-discipline in my life, the
easier and easier it becomes.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
So if I can be self-disciplined
in one small area of my life,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, it makes being
more disciplined in other areas

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.930 align:middle line:90%
of my life easier.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.115 align:middle line:84%
It's like a good
practice and good habits.

00:05:21.115 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So my journey started, I
guess, from a very young age,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
just being out in nature
and exploring the world

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and getting to see sharks
for what they're really like,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:84%
experiencing whales
and dolphins,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and just absolutely
falling in love

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:90%
with nature's marine animals.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.763 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I wanted
to help marine animals.

00:05:50.763 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And so originally, I
was going to school

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:84%
to be a marine
mammal veterinarian.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I got my dive
instructor captain's

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.290 align:middle line:84%
license, started to
go into the fields

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:90%
and get experience in research.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky enough to
travel around the world, work

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:84%
with over 30 different
species of sharks.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I got to work with
whales, many cetaceans,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of different
types of fish.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But I think what stood out
to me throughout all of it

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:84%
was getting to experience
sharks, so many sharks,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and just being absolutely
enamored with them

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and fascinated and even
from the first shark

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
that I saw when I was seven or
eight years old, and actually

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.830 align:middle line:84%
swimming after it, and then
growing up and realizing

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that people are
terrified of sharks,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.275 align:middle line:84%
because they lack, you know,
real, practical knowledge

00:06:40.275 --> 00:06:41.075 align:middle line:90%
or science.

00:06:41.075 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.340 align:middle line:84%
They just kind of believe what
they're told in the media,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and the media just
capitalizes off

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
of demonizing them and
sensationalizing them

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So I've kind of
dedicated my life

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:84%
to helping to overcome
that, to change

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:84%
that fear to
fascination, to replace

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
this false information
with factual information,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:90%
with science.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've designed
immersive programs

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
to allow people to get
out there in the field

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and actually meet a shark
eye to eye, face to face,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:84%
after they learn the
science about the sharks.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's so neat
to get to, not only

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
inspire people to become
involved in conservation

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:84%
and change their
perception of sharks,

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
but also to watch them
overcome their fear.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
a fear of sharks,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and that comes from a
lack of understanding

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and a lack of information
and, obviously,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:90%
a lack of experience.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But not a lot of people get
experiences with sharks.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:90%
And they are apex predators.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.920 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely a better
way to interact with them.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are things that you
should probably avoid, just

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
like you would doing any kind of
activity that could potentially

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.418 align:middle line:90%
be dangerous.

00:07:56.418 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
facts and reality, I mean,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.260 align:middle line:84%
more people die from
tripping and falling

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.097 align:middle line:90%
over things or car accidents.

00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
But again, you know,
people take tests

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to drive cars,
and we've got rules and things

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:90%
for that, too.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So putting together my
science and programs

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:84%
to allow people to
be able to overcome

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:84%
their fears by empowering them
with knowledge and a better

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:84%
understanding, and
I think that helps

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
people to better
appreciate them and better

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:90%
enjoy their own lives as well.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:33.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:84%
So I actually work with great
white sharks every single year.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
I've been very fortunate
to dive with a lot

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:90%
of great white sharks.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:84%
The piece in particular of me
interacting with a great white

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:47.250 align:middle line:84%
shark called Bella that we
released as a conservation

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:84%
campaign with GoPro was supposed
to be kind of the anti-"Jaws."

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So in the movie "Jaws"
that terrified generations

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of people, the little blonde
girl gets eaten by the shark.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to
show the reality.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is
that we actually

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.088 align:middle line:90%
can peacefully coexist.

00:09:02.088 --> 00:09:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And actually, white sharks--
great white sharks--

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
swim past people
every single day,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's rare that they ever
make a mistaken identity bite.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, a lot of
people don't think

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:84%
about that, because it's not put
right in front of their face,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
because the media
doesn't highlight that,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
oh, a shark swam past a
person and didn't mistake it

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:90%
as a prey item.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
That kind of thing
happens every day.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
tend to focus

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:84%
on the things that are put in
front of them rather than going

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:90%
and researching it themselves.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So I guess my advice for
people who are facing something

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:84%
that they're very afraid of is
to go do the research yourself,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:84%
to go look into
it and shed light

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:84%
in that area of darkness
in whatever shape or form

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:90%
it may be.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I do definitely
think that a lot of fear

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
comes from a lack
of understanding

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:90%
and a lack of knowledge.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:90%
And I love to try new things.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I like getting outside
my comfort zone.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I love traveling and exploring,
and I like the stimulation

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.900 align:middle line:84%
that that brings into
my life, into my mind.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And learning and
experiencing things

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.330 align:middle line:84%
helps me to better sympathize
with people, I think,

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think I can better
understand where people

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:84%
are coming from when
I have an open mind

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and I try and consider
their perspective.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's allowed me
to adapt my message

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
to factor in where
somebody is coming from.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So I completely
understand why people

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
would be terrified of
sharks if all they ever got

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
was the usual media hype,
sensationalized, demonized

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:90%
crap.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to do is
change that lack of information

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:84%
into people that are
empowered with knowledge

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully inspired
because of that.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid when I'm
swimming with sharks.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's actually one of
the most relaxing and tranquil

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.030 align:middle line:90%
parts of my day.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible to be out
in open ocean and blue water

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:90%
and just surrounded by sharks.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:90%
I feel so much more alive.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's like you get to see
the ocean in a physical form

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:90%
and completely alive.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're such
incredible creatures.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, once you get
to know them, you

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
can better appreciate
and understand.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And my respect for them
grows every single day.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's not a
fear to be with them.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But I understand
and I see people.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
99% of the people
that go on the boat,

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:84%
from the moment they step on the
boats, fear, fear, fear, fear.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards, on
the way back in,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.140 align:middle line:84%
after they've
learned about sharks,

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.265 align:middle line:84%
and then they've been able
to actually get in there

00:11:46.265 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and see for
themselves the truth,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
you see that fear
switched to fascination.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
exciting, because then I

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:84%
can talk to them
about conservation.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:84%
They're much more
receptive to the message

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
after they've, you know, been
empowered with this experience

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.878 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:12:00.878 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.422 align:middle line:84%
I guess I've been on some
deep, like, night dives, like,

00:12:10.422 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
on scuba dives, where, like,
if your equipment fails,

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of dead, or doing
stunts if something goes wrong.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:84%
For sharks, I mean, I guess
there's the potential.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:84%
The potential is
definitely there

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
to have loss of limb
and loss of life.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, we're offsetting
that with science, knowledge,

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:84%
information, swimming
ability, just being prepared

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:84%
and forward-thinking and
preventative planning,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see something 45
minutes out instead of waiting

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.242 align:middle line:90%
till it's up in your face.

00:12:51.242 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like, I
guess you could say,

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
if somebody is going to
get diagnosed with cancer,

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
if you were talking
to the public,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you share
information with them

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:84%
about the type of
foods or lifestyle

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:84%
that would cause cancer so
you could see it 45 years out,

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:84%
instead of waiting
till, like, here you go,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:90%
here's your diagnosis?

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So again, I think it comes
down to knowledge, information,

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:84%
doing your own research,
becoming aware.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.503 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's the great
thing about a community

00:13:20.503 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
and sharing information,
is that you can

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.420 align:middle line:90%
learn from others' experiences.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, life's too short
to specialize in everything.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.230 align:middle line:90%
But we have the internet.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of
information and lots

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
of people willing to
share their specialties.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I can teach
somebody what to do

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and what not to do if
they ever encounter

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.882 align:middle line:84%
a shark in 20 minutes, and
maybe that can save their life.

00:13:41.882 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, what if you could watch
something for, you know,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
60 to 90 minutes, and
you took all that advice,

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.575 align:middle line:84%
and that could help you
avoid a cancer diagnosis,

00:13:52.575 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
you know, 45 years
down the line?

00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm very aware
of my own body in regards

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of athletic
things that I would do.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I can kind of feel and start to
recognize when I'm pushing it,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:90%
when I can push it more.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But I've also learned,
especially from freediving,

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes your
body says, "No, OK, you

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.180 align:middle line:90%
can only do so much."

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you can overcome that
kind of negative mental chatter

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that's saying, "Oh,
no, you can't do more,

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
you can't do more,
you can't do more,"

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.820 align:middle line:84%
that you actually can
do a lot more than you

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:90%
think that you're capable of.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And freediving definitely
is solid evidence for that.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And so what I was doing
when I was training

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
was any time I would have
a negative thought come

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
in my head, like,
"This is uncomfortable,

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and you can't do
this kind of thing,"

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
and immediately replace
it with "I love this,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:90%
and this feels good."

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And so actually, when I would
feel that feeling, even if it

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
was like pain or
discomfort, as long as I

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.440 align:middle line:84%
was consciously programming
myself to say, "No, I

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:84%
love this," like, "this
is a great feeling,"

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and, like, just staying
positive about it,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing how much
further you can go.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.908 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's just another
10 seconds or 20 seconds.

00:15:16.908 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
But in freediving,
when you're trying

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to break a national record, it
makes a really big difference.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think with any kind
of training, you know,

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:84%
there's definitely a point
where maybe you could overdo it.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be
sensitive to that.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.080 align:middle line:90%
But it's a build.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you're constantly building
up, and you're adding to it

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.148 align:middle line:84%
and adding to it
and adding to it,

00:15:36.148 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that you should
place limits on yourself.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's actually--

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it's good when
you push yourself.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I love to push myself
a little bit further.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I do that in
one area in my life,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I find that I start to do that
in other areas of my life.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And so even if you have,
like, a to-do list,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're checking off
things, what if you commit to,

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.383 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm going to check three
things off my to-do list today?

00:15:59.383 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you get those three
things done, and you're like,

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I can do one more, and you
push yourself to do one more.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.068 align:middle line:84%
And just think of how much
better you feel about that.

00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, you're
obviously getting

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.461 align:middle line:84%
a lot more stuff done, so
that's less stuff to do later.

00:16:11.461 --> 00:16:18.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people try
and fill a void in their life

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:90%
with food.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they're eating and
eating and over-eating,

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to fill themselves
with a good feeling.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But the good feeling that you
get from food never lasts,

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:84%
whereas if you're living
your life for a deeper,

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:84%
more fulfilling purpose,
that that's going to satiate

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
a different part of, like,
your body, your soul,

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
your mind that food
just really can't.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's important
to have that purpose,

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:90%
have that deeper meaning.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's different
for everybody.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's really great
if people can find something

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that kind of, you know, speaks
to them, that they recognize

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:90%
with, that inspires them.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And it could be simple.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much going on
in the world and so many people

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:90%
that need help.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's in the giving.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, when you give back,
that that's where I find

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.859 align:middle line:84%
and I see that more
people find fulfillment.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
like, receiving a gift,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:90%
you feel good, right?

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know about,
like, what you're like,

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:84%
but for me, when I
give a gift, like,

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
it's just as exciting,
if not more exciting,

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:90%
to actually give something.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And giving something back to
a community, to an individual,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:84%
to an animal, at
least for me, I find

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that to be much more gratifying
than receiving anything.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:55.716 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.716 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
The legacy I would like
to leave for the world--

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd really to inspire a
generation of people who really

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:84%
care about the ocean,
really care about sharks

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
enough to change the way
that we interact with it,

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.296 align:middle line:84%
to take care of it rather
than to just take from.

00:18:13.296 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that visualization
really works.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that
believing in yourself

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
is so critical, 'cause
whether you think you can

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.460 align:middle line:84%
or you think you
can't, you're right.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think knowing that
you're capable of more

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and pushing yourself to
be better all the time,

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and then still, you know,
celebrating small victories.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to give
yourself encouragement.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:84%
If all you're ever doing
is tearing yourself down,

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.485 align:middle line:84%
it's not really going
to do too much for you,

00:18:50.485 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
going to be happy.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you need to just
be happy in that moment.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.830 align:middle line:90%
And you should be.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
You should be
happy every moment,

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:90%
and every moment's perfect.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't stop you from
pushing yourself and achieving

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
greater goals and becoming
better and better.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:90%
To have goals is great.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, why limit yourself?

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.227 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people have
negative thoughts

00:19:20.227 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:90%
that come into their mind.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to you
to make a choice

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
whether you want to hold onto
those and believe them or not.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see why
anyone would believe them,

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
why anyone would
place limitations

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:84%
on themselves, unless they
enjoy being miserable.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So it just comes down
to a simple choice.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're angry, and
you just got in a fight

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
with your significant
other or something,

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:84%
you literally have the choice
in the next three seconds

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:84%
after that to let go of those
feelings, snap out of it,

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:84%
and choose to just
be happy and move on.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
The choice comes down
to humans and being

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:84%
able to control your emotions
or at least acknowledge

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:90%
and recognize them.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's that
self-awareness in so

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.600 align:middle line:90%
many aspects of people's lives.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the missing little
key link, is that awareness.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So anything that you're
doing in your life that's

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:15.580 align:middle line:84%
not serving you, try to be
more aware of that habit,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just like,
"Hey, I'm doing this,

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.590 align:middle line:90%
and I know I shouldn't do this."

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And then try and put
in healthy substitutes.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Try and make it easier for
yourself to avoid situations

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:90%
that are difficult for you.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.530 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:90%
Life's not perfect.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Life's messy.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Life's full of
uncomfortable situations.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And just accept it
and move through it.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Adapt to it.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I actually kind of like
the saying, "Adapt or die."

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
that theory of evolving

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:84%
with, like, technology
and the latest information

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I really like to see
people that get out there

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.550 align:middle line:90%
and experience life.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And those people are
so much more vibrant

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:90%
and fun to be around.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, nobody's life
is just all uphill and perfect,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:90%
perfect, perfect.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But I think it comes down to
attitude and personal choices

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.040 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.957 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody's going
to go through stuff,

00:21:13.957 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:84%
but it's those people that
are stronger mentally--

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:84%
that choose to be
stronger mentally--

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
overcome those obstacles,

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.023 align:middle line:84%
take it as a challenge,
integrate it into their lives,

00:21:28.023 --> 00:21:29.190 align:middle line:90%
and just make them stronger.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:36.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you're trying
to change bad habits,

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
or you're trying to
train for something,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and you sometimes just have
to get out of your own way

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and just commit to something
and commit to a plan.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Commit to a training plan.

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Commit to a goal.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And then get out
of your own way.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
Like, actually go for it.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I find that actually
making vision boards,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.560 align:middle line:84%
like, little cut-outs
from, like, a magazine

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:84%
or a printout from
offline, and putting those

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
up in different places helps me
to stay in line with my goal,

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:90%
because I kind of see it.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a reminder for,
hey, what am I doing today

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
at this moment or
in this week that's

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
going to help me to reach
that dream or that goal?

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I'm doing
these day-to-day actions,

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:84%
how am I living in congruence
with my goals, with my mission,

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:90%
with my dreams, et cetera?

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So if my biggest
goal, mission, dream

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
is to help gain better
protection for sharks

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean and inspire
more people to care about it,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.890 align:middle line:84%
what am I doing on a
day-to-day basis that honors

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:90%
that, that's in line with that?

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I've actually put into
place systems, companies, teams

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:84%
to help me stay
in line with that

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:90%
so I can kind of feel great.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, every day, something's
happening towards that goal.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I do feel bad
if I'm not, like,

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.092 align:middle line:84%
doing a social media
post every single day,

00:23:01.092 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:84%
because it's that many
more people that I

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:90%
can reach with that message.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:90%
And I get it.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, in a 24-hour
time period, I

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.770 align:middle line:84%
think it's a little
unrealistic to be

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
able to hit every single
goal that I have for, like,

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.900 align:middle line:90%
my perfect dream day.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But when you're working
on bigger projects,

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
like, don't get down on
yourself if you're not

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:84%
getting your perfect thing
every single day or exactly

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.105 align:middle line:90%
on the hour or whatever it is.

00:23:24.105 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, look at the
bigger picture.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Look at the bigger goal.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And find something that
fits within your lifestyle.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:90%
I travel a lot.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm definitely not
on a 24-hour life cycle,

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:84%
because it's just impossible
for me to fit everything

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that I want to
fit into 24 hours.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's
like, you have time

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:90%
for what you make time for.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to
schedule those appointments

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.660 align:middle line:84%
for things that are important
to you with yourself.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And then treat them as
if you're scheduling them

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.210 align:middle line:84%
with the most important
person to you,

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.668 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
going to keep them.

00:23:55.668 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, go with the flow.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Life's not perfect.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Life can be kind of messy.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Just accept it as
that, go with the flow,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:90%
and do the best that you can.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And keep pushing
yourself to do better.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:90%
