00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for me, there was
always something inside of me.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.445 align:middle line:84%
I always felt there was
something different about me.

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But different when you're
growing up as a kid

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:90%
is not good.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not cool.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.472 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be different.

00:00:24.472 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:90%
You want to fit in.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never honored
that piece of me.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And if I look back on my
life now, and in hindsight,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
looking back, I think that
I'm so connected to my mother.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:90%
And she is so intuitive.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
She's got this
incredible intuition.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:84%
But my mother never put
a value on her own skin.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:90%
She never looked after herself.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:90%
She never trusted her voice.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So my mother always
said, lovingly,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:90%
that you were different.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And she never said
it in a way that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.838 align:middle line:84%
made me feel even more
insecure, which I was deeply.

00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
She'd always say it in
the most loving way.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.930 align:middle line:84%
She was my biggest believer
and still is to this day.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't I didn't
trust that intuition.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:84%
No one said to me that it's
OK to feel and to connect

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.180 align:middle line:84%
emotionally and to
trust that emotion.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
You have to follow a
particular way of being.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
dyslexic and you're

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:84%
trying to find your
way in a school

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and you can't do what everyone
else can do so easily,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
you question who
you are at the core.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you had pretty
much every single teacher

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.233 align:middle line:84%
telling me, every day
of my life that you're

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:90%
going to be a failure.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.160 align:middle line:90%
You're lazy.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to amount anything.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, that was challenging.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But I look back
and I would always

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
have said that there was
something there, but no one,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I felt, guided me or maybe
I wasn't ready for it.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So there was something there
that got uncovered and became

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more evident
much later in life.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So I was at that point
in my life in Dublin,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I was living out what I
thought was the perfect plan.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Make enough money,
become financially free,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and then go and find
what you love doing.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Then go and find the passion.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was perfect.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.705 align:middle line:84%
And it appeared that
everywhere I went,

00:02:12.705 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:84%
everyone was telling me
to do the same thing.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Every seminar, every
audio book, every--

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to
say podcast 'cause

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't many of them--
were saying the same thing.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Become financially free and then
go and do what you want to do.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:90%
You'll have all this freedom.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.252 align:middle line:90%
And it was killing me.

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It was killing my soul.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being asked to
do a speech at one of my best

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:90%
friend's.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was it was a speech
that happened in a place called

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:90%
the Spa Hotel in Dublin.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And there was a stage
in this big ballroom.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.403 align:middle line:84%
And I said, where's
the top table?

00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:90%
He said, on the stage.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.528 align:middle line:90%
And I said, where do I speak?

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.237 align:middle line:90%
He said, on the stage.

00:02:44.237 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people would
have said, how exciting.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was just so nervous.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.840 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted--

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to get up there.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to--

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.512 align:middle line:84%
I actually almost say to
him, find somebody else.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that wouldn't
have gone down too well.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, long story short,
I find myself on the stage.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And leading up to
it, I was in my head.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I was stuck in my head
trying to figure out

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
how to be funny, how to
impact, how to be nice,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
how to make sure I slam him
and take him out and make

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:84%
her look amazing and all
these sorts of things.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere along the line
I think I can only put it down

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.555 align:middle line:84%
to a degree of courage
that I decided to say,

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:90%
just speak from your heart.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:90%
Speak your truth.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And I got up and I
spoke from my heart.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember just saying a
few things about one of my best

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
buddies from my heart, and there
was just people started crying.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.542 align:middle line:84%
And there was a bit of
carnage and lot of emotion.

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And the very end of
the speech, anyway, I

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.128 align:middle line:84%
got this standing
ovation, which is not

00:03:35.128 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:84%
typical in an Irish wedding
or maybe any weddings

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.463 align:middle line:84%
But I always remember
coming down off the stage.

00:03:40.463 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I got a
standing ovation,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:90%
again, my ego didn't kick in.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, oh
my god, I'm the man.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I wanted just the
ground to open up--

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:90%
I was so embarrassed.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.938 align:middle line:84%
I was so embarrassed by
the standing ovation.

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And this young man
approached me with tears

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
rolling down his face,
who I'd never met before

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.948 align:middle line:90%
and I've never met since.

00:03:57.948 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And he put his arms
around me, and he

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
said, if I ever get married,
will you be my best man.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.490 align:middle line:90%
And I turned around, said go--

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.162 align:middle line:84%
you know, feck off type of
thing, as we'd say in Ireland.

00:04:08.162 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, no, I'm serious.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:90%
He says, you've have got a gift.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to say to you
that I absorbed that, I took it

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:84%
on, and from that day
forth, everything changed,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
because often a stranger can
see something in us that we

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:21.545 align:middle line:90%
can't see ourselves.

00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And when our family
tells us that we've

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
got something special,
we often discount it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.160 align:middle line:84%
because they're only saying
that because they love us.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
But it shifted
something-- maybe 1%.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It just opened a
little doorway that

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:84%
was historically
locked, that maybe,

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.610 align:middle line:84%
just maybe, I've got something
of value inside of myself.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, maybe I can
add value to the world in ways

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't previously see.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.866 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I think so many people out there
that set goals and regimently

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
believe in goal-setting
in the traditional sense.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And I don't.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.445 align:middle line:84%
I think that goal-setting
can be effective.

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The challenge with goal-setting
in the traditional sense,

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.945 align:middle line:84%
as it's been introduced to
the world over the last,

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
say, 20, 30, 40 years, is
that it's very mechanical,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:90%
it's very intellectual.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's often set up in a
way that we don't even know.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.135 align:middle line:84%
But we take goals
belonging to society.

00:05:17.135 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
We take goals belonging
to our parents.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:84%
We take goals that
we think and justify

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and rationalize that we
need in order to be happy.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, a lot of
the goals that we set--

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:90%
I was a great goal-setter.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:84%
The problem was, I was
an even better achiever.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.585 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself reaching the
pinnacle of these mountains--

00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:84%
the mountain being
a metaphor for life.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So I reached this
pinnacle, and I'd

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
stand on the top of this
mountain, look around, go--

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would
feel different.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:90%
I thought I'd be happier.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.558 align:middle line:90%
I thought I'd be more content.

00:05:44.558 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd look
across the horizon.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd see another mountain the
distance and go, ah, here's

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:90%
the problem.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.037 align:middle line:90%
I climbed the wrong mountain.

00:05:51.037 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I climbed that
mountain in the distance,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.020 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be happy.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come down
off this mountain,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.110 align:middle line:90%
and I crossed the valley.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And again, this valley
represented years of my life

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.638 align:middle line:90%
in some cases.

00:06:00.638 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'd climb another
mountain, which

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
represented another business,
another financial goal,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
another material goal, or
even a relationship goal.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I get to the top of that and
the same pattern followed me.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I never
realized for-- well,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I did eventually, but
much later in life

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:84%
is like, why don't I
just stop and ask myself,

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
why when I achieve
something is it not enough?

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And for me personally,
I wasn't enough.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't done the inner work.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:90%
I didn't believe in myself.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have value
in my own skin.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what I
achieve externally,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.928 align:middle line:90%
it was never going to be enough.

00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And I got these expectations
on my own shoulders,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.178 align:middle line:84%
and I projected these
expectations at everybody else.

00:06:37.178 --> 00:06:39.553 align:middle line:84%
And when they didn't meet
them, the reason I wasn't happy

00:06:39.553 --> 00:06:42.053 align:middle line:84%
is because they're not living
up to the part of the bargain.

00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:44.135 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend should
be a better girlfriend

00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
because she's not making
me as happy as that.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:90%
And I was externalizing it all.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I didn't stop and look
at myself in the mirror.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.108 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
challenges of seeing the world.

00:06:53.108 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
we often set goals

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and dreams and aspirations
of what we want to do

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and who we want to be, and
we become very identified

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It becomes-- we lose our
identity in what we do,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.353 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to who we are.

00:07:05.353 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So often, when someone sets
out to achieve something

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:84%
significant that
they've set out,

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and even though they have
this inkling in their soul

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.590 align:middle line:84%
that this is not me
anymore, this is not

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.925 align:middle line:84%
aligned to who I
am, they've set it

00:07:17.925 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
out as an intention to the
world so they can't let it go.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So we just stubbornly
move towards the edge

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.550 align:middle line:84%
of the cliff, which represents
an emotional crisis,

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:84%
a breakdown, a slap in the face,
whatever you want to call it.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's a few of the
things that I see commonly.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I see a lot
is-- and the other thing I

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:90%
experienced myself--

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:84%
is who-- there's a question
I ask often, and it's not,

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:84%
are you seeking
validation from somebody.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The question I always ask is,
who are you seeking validation

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you sit
with that question

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:90%
and honestly answer that--

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:90%
truthfully look in the mirror.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Really answer that question
and sit with that question,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I have never found a human being
that's not seeking validation

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:90%
from somebody else.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And typically, it's
those closest to us.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So if we think about
humans, a lot of humans

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
care deeply what
other people think.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.970 align:middle line:84%
You bring that back to your own
home, your family, your mother,

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
your father, typically, you
can multiply that by 1,000.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at that and then

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
you basically look at
the goals and dreams

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.113 align:middle line:84%
you've set for yourself,
what you'll find is

00:08:18.113 --> 00:08:19.753 align:middle line:90%
often you're waiting--

00:08:19.753 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to
achieve something

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
because you want to
get that approval

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and validation from your
dad, from your mother.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I have literally
worked with athletes

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.544 align:middle line:84%
who have gone to the
pinnacle of their career.

00:08:30.544 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
They have gone to the Olympics,
they have gone to the World Cup

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.627 align:middle line:84%
soccer, and their
single motivation

00:08:36.627 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
that they've told
themselves-- they've

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.627 align:middle line:84%
told themselves a
different thing.

00:08:39.627 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:84%
But the single motivation,
when you get to the core,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:84%
was they wanted their
father, in most cases--

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:90%
some cases their mother--

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to turn around and
say, I am proud of you.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And they have spent
10 and 15 and 20

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
years trying to achieve
the pinnacle of this sport

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
for no other reason
than seeking validation

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:84%
from the person that has
been close with them most

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:90%
of their lives.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.376 align:middle line:90%

00:09:08.376 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not necessarily
suggesting it's all wrong

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:90%
and it's fundamentally flawed.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is that
when we're unaware of it,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:90%
we're not necessarily--

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:84%
it's not even "control"
is the wrong word.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.120 align:middle line:90%
We're not doing it for us.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying
is, be aware who

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
you're seeking validation from
and allow that to inform you.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And still achieve,
still go for things,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:90%
still want to be the best.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes we find that--

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I meet entrepreneurs who have
built businesses, empires that

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%
haven't and don't serve them.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But they've reached
certain financial pinnacles

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and aesthetic goals
and recognition goals.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
doing it for reasons

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
that don't align
with who they are--

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:90%
they're external motivators.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:90%
So it's not wrong.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just that if
it can inform you,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I think you're better informed
to make better decisions

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully achieve
greatness and to be

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:90%
aligned while doing it.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.608 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:13.608 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I think it shows up.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I see people's lack of personal
growth and unwillingness

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
to work on themselves
show up in--

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
particularly in
relationships, --

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an intimate
relationship or whether

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.633 align:middle line:90%
it's with family or whatever.

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So think about it in a
parenting context, what

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.492 align:middle line:84%
you have generational behaviors
that have been passed down

00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
through generation, through
generation, through generation.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're conscious of
them, sometimes we're not.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And they can be
beliefs around money.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
They can be the fact that
my dad never hugged me,

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.108 align:middle line:84%
or we're not as open or we
just talk about the weather.

00:10:50.108 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think what happens is,
if someone has the courage

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.710 align:middle line:84%
to stop and say, no, I'm going
to do a deep dive on myself.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.127 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
that inner work, I

00:10:56.127 --> 00:10:58.460 align:middle line:84%
think what we have is
the capacity to change

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:90%
generational behaviors.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
We have the capacity to
change the fundamental outcome

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.355 align:middle line:84%
and the outlook of our core
relationship with our partner.

00:11:06.355 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is
today that we're

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:90%
great at pointing the fingers.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So I say to any couple who
want to work on themselves,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.195 align:middle line:84%
better the relationship,
well, let go of your partner

00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and work on yourself and trust
that they will come along.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people out there

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
who want to change
their partner.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.453 align:middle line:84%
So often I say, when
it comes to couples,

00:11:22.453 --> 00:11:23.620 align:middle line:90%
it's that opposites attract.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.037 align:middle line:84%
We see something in someone
else that we don't necessarily

00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:90%
recognize within ourselves.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.908 align:middle line:84%
Then we spend the next
5, 10, or 15 years

00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
trying to change that person
to see the world like we do.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's about control.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:90%
But if we could let go--

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I said to my wife, within
the last six months,

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm letting you go.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.178 align:middle line:84%
I don't need you
anymore, but I want you.

00:11:45.178 --> 00:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And where I see that's it's
just-- it's kind of jovial,

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.310 align:middle line:84%
but it's very serious is
that if someone splits up,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
we talk about our partners
as your better half.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Someone often says to me,
how's the better half?

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:90%
My wife's not my better half.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.617 align:middle line:90%
My wife is my wife.

00:11:59.617 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Pauline.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.967 align:middle line:90%
And she has her own identity.

00:12:01.967 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And she shouldn't be
on the same page as me.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:90%
She should be separate.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
one of the biggest

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:84%
challenges in
relationships is-- you

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.598 align:middle line:90%
use the analogy of a mountain.

00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:84%
As you start going
up that mountain--

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:84%
the mountain of personal
growth, development,

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:90%
your own personal journey--

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.788 align:middle line:84%
often the person-- one partner
within the relationship

00:12:16.788 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
stays at the bottom because they
don't want to necessarily go

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:90%
on this growth.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:90%
And you push them along.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And they don't see you
wanting them to grow.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
What they see, they internalize
as you want me to change.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, why
don't you love me

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.975 align:middle line:84%
for who I am, as opposed
to who you want me to be.

00:12:30.975 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest challenge is,
as you go up that mountain,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
the other person refuses to
grow or chooses not to move,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:84%
do you stop and come back down
and end up resenting them?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Or do you let go and move
forward and trust that

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.788 align:middle line:84%
by your single change,
by your evolution

00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that they will follow
because they'll

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:90%
see the greatness in you.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They'll see the change,
they'll see the transformation,

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
and they will choose
to move forward.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I think as a
parent, in particular, I

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
think we have a moral obligation
to grow as an individual.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, we're passing
on generational behaviors that

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
have been passed
on to us that we're

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:90%
conscious and unconscious of.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.523 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:06.523 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I think I think my wife's
a great example of this.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
My wife has studied
as an accountant.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So her background is that she
came from a pretty poor area

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:90%
in Ireland, a small rural farm.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things for her
was to get away from that,

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to get away, escape
from the poverty.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.967 align:middle line:84%
Escape from the--
when I say poverty,

00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:32.925 align:middle line:84%
I mean they just they
didn't have the resources

00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:90%
that a lot of people have.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So when she was in school,
she was good at maths.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.835 align:middle line:84%
So someone said, listen,
you're good at maths.

00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Accountants get
paid pretty well.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you become
an accountant?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Her sister was an accountant.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was like, yeah,
this makes total sense.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
This authoritative figure is
telling her what she should do.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:84%
She didn't understand really
that she had choices in life.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:84%
She didn't really know herself
that well and she went down.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is,
fast forward 10 years,

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and she's still
running from what

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:84%
she doesn't want, as opposed
to stopping in life and saying,

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.125 align:middle line:84%
OK, I don't want to be poorer,
I don't want to be this.

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
But could I turn
that-- shift that gaze,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
shift that conversation,
change that around

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.458 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, what do I want?

00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us in this
world are running

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.582 align:middle line:90%
from what we don't want.

00:14:11.582 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Very few people have
stopped and said, OK, I've

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:90%
done that for 20 years.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.990 align:middle line:90%
What do it want now?

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:90%
How can I change the game here?

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:90%
What's possible for my life?

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I love those words,
"What's possible."

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:23.760 align:middle line:90%
That really fires me up.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Because what's possible
is often we can't see it.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
reimagine eventually,

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and she's the worst
accountant in the world.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Not because she's
bad with numbers,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:84%
but because she was never
destined to be an accountant.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.030 align:middle line:84%
She's got greatness and beauty
and the ability to connect

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and the ability
to connect others.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
She's the most
extraordinary mother.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:90%
She's got this incredible gift.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And yet, she was
executing her talent

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.970 align:middle line:84%
for most of her life, which was
her ability to crunch numbers.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:84%
The challenge with that is,
that your kids, for example,

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.840 align:middle line:84%
get to grow up and
they're conditioned

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:90%
to do the same thing.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So how many parents
do you meet--

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
how many parents do I meet--
and you ask them this question,

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
that they're stuck and they're
in a job they don't want to do.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:90%
They're misaligned.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
They're in a business
they don't want to be in

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.285 align:middle line:90%
and they don't change.

00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:14.410 align:middle line:84%
In why they don't change,
they'll say to you things

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
like, well, I've got to
pay for the private school.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.482 align:middle line:84%
I've got to pay for
the holidays, got

00:15:17.482 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:90%
to pay for the cars.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:90%
So fast forward 20 years.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's called this guy John.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Fast forward 20 years, John, say
one of your kids comes to you

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:90%
and says, Dad, I'm stuck.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:90%
Don't like my work.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.855 align:middle line:90%
Misaligned my job.

00:15:31.855 --> 00:15:32.980 align:middle line:90%
What would you say to them?

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Most parents would say,
live your dream, buddy.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't do something
you don't want to do.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:90%
But they won't do it themselves.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So what's going to
happen in 20 years,

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.930 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be a lecture.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
lecture, and the kid

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.755 align:middle line:84%
is going to be looking at
you as not a kid anymore.

00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So now they're going, yeah,
Dad, yeah, Dad, whatever.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Rolling their eyes
externally or internally

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:90%
because you didn't do it.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to be the
inspiration, the invitation,

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:84%
the challenge, the
possibility is do it

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:84%
now so that conversation
never needs to exist.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Because your kids are brought up
knowing that if I am not happy

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.037 align:middle line:84%
here and I'm not happy here
and I'm misaligned here

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm being treated
poorly that I have got

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
the right and the
ability to change it now.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.462 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:20.462 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.897 align:middle line:84%
I think visualization is
extraordinarily powerful.

00:16:27.897 --> 00:16:29.980 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is, what are
you going to visualize,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and how do we ensure that
what we're visualizing

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:90%
is in alignment with who we are?

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
visualization can

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.990 align:middle line:84%
be both beautiful and brilliant
and incredibly dangerous.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I've met so many people that
have come to me 10 years, 15,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:84%
20 years, arguably, you could
say, too late to discover that

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
what they visualized, what
they set out to achieve

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
wasn't really a part
of who they are.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So the better-- often
people saying to me,

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:90%
how do I find my passion.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:90%
How do I find my purpose?

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:84%
My number one is, we
should reframe the word

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.863 align:middle line:84%
"find" and say, how
do we uncover it,

00:17:01.863 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
because finding
almost illustrates

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that it's under the bed or
it's over behind a counter

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:90%
or it's in a box somewhere.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.335 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it's
within ourselves.

00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about
that and say, OK,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:90%
what if I understand who I am.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, what I am here to
do starts to kind of become--

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:90%
it just starts to just roll out.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It starts to become
very evident in time.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.119 align:middle line:84%
So visualization is
extraordinarily powerful.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've used visualization
myself to visualize myself

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:90%
onstage.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Not a specific stage, not
with a specific speaker.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But I remember just the
feeling of standing on a stage

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and attempting to emotionally
engage with other people.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And years later, I find
myself speaking on stages

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't have imagined.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But there were places
in between where

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:84%
I lost that connection,
that emotional connection.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And I started, as embarrassing
as it is, looking at speakers

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and going, I want to be them.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:90%
That's who I want to be.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to
be something I wasn't.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:90%
And every time, I lose myself.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I get up into my
head, I lose myself.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:90%
It becomes misaligned.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:90%
It becomes distorted.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:11.140 align:middle line:84%
So when I get back to
the emotional connection,

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.090 align:middle line:90%
it's not attached to an outcome.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling, and it's
very, very different.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you can align
the intellectual goal

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:84%
with the emotion and that's
what you visualize on,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:90%
it's extraordinary.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that I
just announced last night, I

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:84%
announced that the first
time seven years ago--

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's nothing to do
with Donald Trump-- is I

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
have announced that I want to
be president of Ireland in 2025.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And people have said to me--
they've judged me for the last

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:37.840 align:middle line:90%
seven years on this--

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't talk about it a lot.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And very few people
have ever asked me why.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
They judge me, but
they don't ask me why.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.223 align:middle line:90%
And it's all about my why.

00:18:48.223 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to be president
of Ireland, which

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:90%
is not a very political role--

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm not big into politics.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's so I can use the
office to not just promote,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:84%
but inspire people to promote
the island of Ireland,

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:90%
the place that I love so much.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:84%
To give back to that country, to
inspire the people of Ireland.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But if nothing else, I
created an intention.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I visualize something
in the future and 2025.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
If I happen to be
the scapegoat that

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.913 align:middle line:84%
falls false flat on his
face-- if I'm the guy that

00:19:12.913 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:84%
gets ridiculed for even
wanting such a silly dream,

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:84%
for putting
themselves out there,

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
but if it inspires one
other the human being to go,

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:90%
wow, you mean you can do that?

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:90%
You can make an intent?

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:84%
You can visualize
something you want in 2025?

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they'll do a book.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.733 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they'll share their story.

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:29.097 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they'll do a podcast.

00:19:29.097 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they'll make a film.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they'll do
something different.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And if I have to take some
flak for that in the next 10

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.672 align:middle line:90%
or 15 years, so be it.

00:19:38.672 --> 00:19:41.504 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:41.504 --> 00:19:45.760 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.390 align:middle line:84%
What I do today is a
representation of the life

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:90%
that I've lived.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.420 align:middle line:90%
So life leaves clues.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.230 align:middle line:84%
When I look back over my
life, everything I do today,

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:90%
the signposts were there.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had my stag
party 15 years ago,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and I ran a workshop
for 25 guys,

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:90%
the west coast of Ireland.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And that has inspired an
experience that I run today.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.823 align:middle line:84%
And I was focused so much on
the future and spending so much

00:20:14.823 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
time in the future, running
towards something that I

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
thought would make me
happy-- and it might have--

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:84%
but I never put a
value on the past.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.675 align:middle line:90%
I never put a value on my story.

00:20:23.675 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't believe
there's any greater

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.550 align:middle line:84%
story in the world than
my individual story,

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
than your individual
story, than other people's

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:84%
individual stories
because it's theirs.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge
today is so many people

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:90%
want other people's stories.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:84%
They go, oh, I want a bit of
Branson's, and I want a bit

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.340 align:middle line:84%
of this guy's, and I want
a bit of that woman's.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, you
don't get that luxury.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.720 align:middle line:90%
So you've got two choices--

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.220 align:middle line:84%
you accept the one
you've been given

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and you do the work
on it so you can

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.450 align:middle line:84%
accept the good, the
bad, and the ugly of it

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and see the gift
and the pain, or you

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.472 align:middle line:84%
can spend the rest of your
life trying to rewrite

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:54.460 align:middle line:90%
the story of the past.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I also say the past
has created the present

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.092 align:middle line:84%
and the present is
creating the future.

00:20:59.092 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So everything we've
been, everybody

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.008 align:middle line:84%
we've met, every
circumstance we've

00:21:02.008 --> 00:21:04.720 align:middle line:84%
been in, every decision we've
made, every decision we haven't

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:84%
made has ultimately
created who we are today.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, every decision
that we're making today,

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and every decision
we're not making today,

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.947 align:middle line:84%
everything we're doing today
is determining our future.

00:21:14.947 --> 00:21:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
understand your patterns,

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.447 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
understand self-sabotage,

00:21:18.447 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:84%
you want to understand who
you are at the core, go back.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.005 align:middle line:90%
You go back to the future.

00:21:24.005 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:84%
You go back and
understand who you are.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.645 align:middle line:84%
You don't stay here forever,
but go back and do a deep dive.

00:21:28.645 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
You ask people
what's your story,

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.020 align:middle line:90%
they go, I was born in Dublin.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Two older brothers.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.570 align:middle line:90%
I went to school for 15 years.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:35.950 align:middle line:90%
I used to like cycling my bike.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.617 align:middle line:84%
I played a bit of
soccer, and that's it.

00:21:37.617 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not your story.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Go back and really do a
deep dive in your story.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:84%
It can be incredibly
cathartic, incredibly

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
therapeutic, it can be
incredibly profound.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find is insights
into what I call your gift.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Picasso said, the meaning of
life is to find your gift.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of life
is to give it away.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a gift.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:90%
People call it a purpose.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it a passion.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I believe we've all
got a gift within us.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't need to
be necessarily found.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.620 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be uncovered.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
clues, I believe,

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.660 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what your gift
is, what you're here to do

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:90%
is in your story.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:84%
On the gift, if I
may just add this

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
is I believe our gift is
this inherent ability that we

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.860 align:middle line:84%
have to impact other
people in a positive way.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:90%
To give back.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:90%
To impact the world.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.900 align:middle line:84%
To shift somebody
emotionally or mentally.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:90%
That's our gift.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has that capacity.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.810 align:middle line:84%
What makes our gift
unique is the lens

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.260 align:middle line:84%
in which we look through it, and
that is our personal narrative.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:90%
That's our personal story.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So when I went back and I
understood the joy of my life

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and the pain of my life,
my mission became, I never

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.017 align:middle line:84%
want anyone to
experience that pain.

00:22:48.017 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that comes
into contact with me

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:84%
is not going to go through the
challenges that I went through.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.745 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to go through
the misalignments I go through.

00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to help them
through my personal narrative,

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily experienced
the same pain that I did

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and fast track the process
so they can make a bigger

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.320 align:middle line:84%
impact in their own lives
and other people's lives

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:90%
faster than I did.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.518 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:09.518 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that intuition is
something that's just--

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:84%
it has been undervalued
for many, many years.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I think people are starting to
really appreciate and respect

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it has huge value,
not just in our personal lives.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
People think of an
intuition is just

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:84%
some floppy kind of
personal concept thing that

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:90%
just works in my personal life.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:84%
It's got a massive
application in business.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So I had a client
recently-- we sat down,

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and it was a $3
million conversation.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
They either did this deal
or they didn't do this deal.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.528 align:middle line:84%
And we just sat
there and we didn't

00:23:42.528 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:84%
talk about the strategy and
the tactics of this outcome.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.320 align:middle line:90%
We just talked about her life.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.903 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
some of the things

00:23:47.903 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
she's gone through,
some of the things

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that she has this tendency to
do, like complicate her life

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.118 align:middle line:84%
and create complexity
and put stress

00:23:55.118 --> 00:23:56.410 align:middle line:90%
on herself and everything else.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And we just talked
about and connected her

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
emotionally with
some of the things

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
that she's been through,
some of the things

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.625 align:middle line:90%
she wants to achieve.

00:24:01.625 --> 00:24:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end
of the conversation,

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, would you want
to get back to this deal

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that you want to do and decide
what you should-- and she goes,

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
no, I know exactly
what I need to do.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And up to that point, not
because it's about me, but up

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.127 align:middle line:84%
to that point, she was
going to execute this deal

00:24:14.127 --> 00:24:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and it wouldn't have served her.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.960 align:middle line:84%
It might have made
her money, but it

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:90%
wasn't going to serve her.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So many of us have
got into relationships

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:24.670 align:middle line:84%
that we know in our heart and
soul, we know it's not aligned,

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:84%
whether it's in business or
it's in a personal relationship.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.200 align:middle line:84%
We do it anyway
and it goes south.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.653 align:middle line:90%
We get screwed eventually.

00:24:32.653 --> 00:24:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we blame the
person; sometimes we get angry.

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.737 align:middle line:84%
But if we looked in
the mirror and said,

00:24:36.737 --> 00:24:40.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, did you really know that
that was in alignment or not.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And often, the case
is, we absolutely did.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.370 align:middle line:84%
The client of mine
said one day, I'm

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:84%
sorry I listened to my
intuition, said no one ever.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Your intuition, I believe,
will never lead you astray.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:90%
It has never been wrong.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:90%
It never will be wrong.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It will always lead you
in the right direction,

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
even if it appears
initially that it didn't.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is,
can we listen to it?

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
As a kid, I believe that
we have immense intuition.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of who we are.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And then, I think, one of
the things that happens--

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:90%
just one--

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:90%
is we start to want to fit in.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So in the schoolyard,
we're around 10 years old--

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:90%
I used to say 15.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:90%
I think it happens much sooner.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:90%
And maybe even eight.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And we want to fit into
the group over here

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
or we want to stand out
in the group over there.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And we lean over and
we pick up a mask

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:90%
and we put it on our face.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And we just pretend to
be a little bit different

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
than who we are really.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we take another
mask later in life in college

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
to kind of stand out and be the
clown or be the funny person

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:84%
or be the drinker or be
the whatever because we

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:46.860 align:middle line:90%
want to fit in there.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we get into corporate
life and we do the same thing,

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.130 align:middle line:84%
and then we may set
up our own business

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it happens to be.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We go to a bar,
we put on makeup,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.570 align:middle line:84%
but we also wear a
couple of masks with us.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And we pretend to be somebody
that we're not necessarily

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.170 align:middle line:84%
at the core in order
to achieve something.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think that every
time we do that, we

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:90%
suppress that intuition.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.640 align:middle line:84%
We're absorbing
information in the world

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:90%
today like the speed of light.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:84%
If information was
the problem, we'd

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:16.600 align:middle line:84%
all be blissfully happy
and incredibly healthy,

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:90%
eating the perfect food.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
If I've got waist, and I've
got a little bit of weight

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
perhaps I need to lose, I know
if I give up alcohol, reduce

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.020 align:middle line:84%
my sugar intake, do a bit
more exercise, or even

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
similar exercise, I'm
going to lose some of it.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't need another
book to tell me that.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.160 align:middle line:90%
But why haven't I do that?

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:90%
Why amn't I doing that?

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes we're
absorbing so much information

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that we're not giving it
time to go from information

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
to knowledge,
knowledge to wisdom,

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.240 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom to awareness.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm too busy running to
the next book and the next book

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:46.910 align:middle line:90%
and the next book.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm absorbing
so much information,

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.370 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not allowing it to
translate into awareness

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So to me, intuition is one
of these things that's been

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.760 align:middle line:90%
suppressed, it's been blocked.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.055 align:middle line:84%
And I would encourage anybody
in the world if they want to--

00:27:01.055 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:84%
if they want to get in touch
with more intuition, if they

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.650 align:middle line:84%
want to increase
their intuition,

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:09.772 align:middle line:84%
if they want to
uncover more of it,

00:27:09.772 --> 00:27:11.230 align:middle line:84%
don't go looking
for it externally.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Ask yourself, why isn't it?

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not in touch with it?

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it close?

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it attainable?

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.018 align:middle line:90%
What's blocking is?

00:27:23.018 --> 00:27:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Intuition is just been blocked.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.570 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.422 align:middle line:90%
We all have it.

00:27:26.422 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And I find one of the biggest
inhibitors to intuition

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:29.430 align:middle line:90%
is anger.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest blocks
to intuition is anger.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.080 align:middle line:84%
The challenge with
anger is societally,

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:90%
we don't understand anger.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.552 align:middle line:84%
We think anger is throwing
chairs across the room,

00:27:41.552 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:84%
shouting at people,
taking golf clubs out

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
of the back of our cars
when someone cuts us off

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.190 align:middle line:84%
of the traffic lights,
we think that's anger.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's not really
given a place in society

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:90%
for conversation and respect.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in this
world has anger--

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:90%
everybody.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.640 align:middle line:90%
It's an emotion.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.378 align:middle line:84%
The problem is where it becomes
very dangerous is when we

00:28:01.378 --> 00:28:03.920 align:middle line:84%
don't-- we're not aware of it
and we're not in touch with it.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Anger, I believe, is
the greatest inhibitor

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to intuition flowing between
our brain and our body.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.242 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:12.242 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a really
interesting question.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:84%
In a coaching capacity, I
used to use accountability

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.880 align:middle line:90%
a lot more.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.295 align:middle line:84%
So accountability
was a cornerstone

00:28:27.295 --> 00:28:28.420 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of the work I did.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember literally
in between weekends

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.448 align:middle line:84%
with ongoing clients getting
them to identify the three

00:28:35.448 --> 00:28:37.490 align:middle line:84%
things they were going to
do between this session

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and the next session.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I would literally get them
to sign the piece of paper

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:84%
with their signature and I
would hold them accountable.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.298 align:middle line:84%
And to some extent,
I was ruthless.

00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Like if they came in
and they didn't do it,

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:48.673 align:middle line:84%
they had to have a
really good reason.

00:28:48.673 --> 00:28:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I was like a
teacher on steroids.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was they
were achieving the things,

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't getting any
more fulfilled in some cases.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.227 align:middle line:84%
They weren't necessarily more
happier in their own skin.

00:29:01.227 --> 00:29:02.810 align:middle line:84%
They didn't necessarily
have the peace

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of mind, which I think is
an incredible indicator.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.398 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know how happy
you are, how aligned you are,

00:29:07.398 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:84%
just check in and
see how at peace you

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:90%
are within your own soul.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have peace,
you're misaligned somewhere

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.060 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just your body telling
you something's out of kilter.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Trust it.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Don't ignore it.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I found myself questioning
this accountability.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Why do I have to keep grown
men and women accountable?

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is a
lot of the goals or the things

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.530 align:middle line:84%
they committed to doing
were out of alignments

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.730 align:middle line:84%
because they were basically
trying to achieve things

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:84%
towards a common goal a common
dream or anything else, which

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.090 align:middle line:90%
wasn't part of who they were.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was
I scrapped that,

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and my work has now
become all about becoming

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
aligned with your purpose,
aligned, uncovering your gift,

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.170 align:middle line:84%
executing your gift,
and impacting the world.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And when someone gets in
touch with their gift, when

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:55.400 align:middle line:84%
they start to uncover it, when
someone starts to see and feel

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
that they're on purpose,
no one in this world

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.380 align:middle line:90%
needs to keep them accountable.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:04.380 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Even people who've
said, oh I'm lazy.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.912 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah right.

00:30:07.912 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:84%
You're lazy because you
know what, you're doing

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:90%
shit you don't want to do.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.270 align:middle line:90%
Procrastination.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.010 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh, I'm
a procrastinator.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:14.948 align:middle line:90%
Said, no, you're not.

00:30:14.948 --> 00:30:16.740 align:middle line:84%
You're just putting
yourself under pressure

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to do stuff towards
something that's

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.820 align:middle line:90%
not aligned to who you are.

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.148 align:middle line:84%
You get somebody
on purpose, no one

00:30:24.148 --> 00:30:25.440 align:middle line:90%
needs to keep them accountable.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:84%
It's extraordinary to watch what
happens to their productivity,

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:33.120 align:middle line:84%
their output, their
courage, because it's not

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:90%
about them anymore.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe all of our
purposes, all of our gifts,

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.130 align:middle line:84%
are connected to
impacting other people.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you stop making
this journey about you,

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.490 align:middle line:84%
you can externalize-- you're
focusing on other people.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.520 align:middle line:84%
You don't need anyone
to keep you accountable.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't even need a
reminder on your iPhone

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.010 align:middle line:84%
necessarily because
you do it every waking

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.310 align:middle line:90%
moment of every single day.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.256 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:57.256 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe the
goal should ever

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
be to get over fear, because
I don't think you can.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I think fear has more energy
then you and I will ever have.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And most people run from fear,
and fear doesn't need caffeine.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.270 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need green juice.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need water.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't need food.

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.420 align:middle line:84%
No matter how fast
and how hard you

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.420 align:middle line:84%
run for as many years
as you possibly can,

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and eventually when you stop
and you're out of breath,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.980 align:middle line:84%
you eventually have to take
a break, you look behind

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and the bastard's right
over your shoulder.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:90%
It will always be with you.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.070 align:middle line:84%
So rather than trying
to eradicate fear,

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.310 align:middle line:84%
killing fear, moving
beyond fear, why don't we

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.530 align:middle line:84%
turn about and just
get to know it.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we sit down
and understand it?

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Every time I get on
a stage and speak,

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.000 align:middle line:90%
every time, I want to puke.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.200 align:middle line:90%
I get up there--

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.920 align:middle line:84%
before I get up, I have this
butterfly, horrible feeling

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.020 align:middle line:90%
in my stomach I want to puke up.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.620 align:middle line:84%
But what I've learned
to do is become

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.590 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with the unknown,
comfortable with fear

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:90%
to a point.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.373 align:middle line:84%
So when the fear comes, I
basically just sometimes close

00:32:14.373 --> 00:32:16.290 align:middle line:84%
my eyes, and as corny
as it sounds, I just go,

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.630 align:middle line:90%
ha, you're back.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And when you name it,
it doesn't disappear.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.740 align:middle line:90%
It just loosens its grip on you.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So understand the fear because
it's never going to go away.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so many
books, so many conversations,

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:84%
so many speeches around fear,
and yet, it still grips so much

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.530 align:middle line:90%
of the population today.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
My belief is that we
shouldn't try to eradicate it.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:84%
We should get to know
it and understand it.

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you do a
deep dive into--

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and not even a deep
dive, just face the fear

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.985 align:middle line:84%
and really break down
what is it actually about,

00:32:49.985 --> 00:32:51.360 align:middle line:84%
what you'll find
as it brings you

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.380 align:middle line:84%
in ways and in doorways and
in corridors that you'd never

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.670 align:middle line:90%
previously understood.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you, the next
time you do the very same act,

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.540 align:middle line:84%
the fear will come up, it
just won't last as long.

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:04.530 align:middle line:90%
It won't grip you.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It won't stifle you.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And you just keep going.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the invitation
and the challenge

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%
is to get to understand the
fear, not just intellectually,

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.490 align:middle line:84%
but get in touch
with it emotionally.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And almost for it to
become your friend.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.476 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.476 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But beyond fear, I appreciate
fear holds people back in some

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.330 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:84%
The thing that I feel
holds people back most is

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.410 align:middle line:90%
a lack of value in themselves.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I meet people and they
have a dream or an aspiration,

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.313 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps they don't,
most people I meet

00:33:43.313 --> 00:33:44.730 align:middle line:84%
don't have clarity
about what they

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.530 align:middle line:90%
want to do when they grow up.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Which, ironically, offers
a type of convenience

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.290 align:middle line:84%
because telling yourself that
you're unclear, constantly

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
telling yourself you're unclear,
is kind of cool because then

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.625 align:middle line:90%
you don't actually have to act.

00:33:57.625 --> 00:33:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry,
but everyone knows

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:84%
what they want to do for
the rest of their life,

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.677 align:middle line:84%
and I give you an
example of this.

00:34:01.677 --> 00:34:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I was in a meeting
recently, and there

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.040 align:middle line:90%
was a gentleman in front of me.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about the
fact that he wasn't happy

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.030 align:middle line:84%
and aligned within the
business that he did.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't happy.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.449 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, do you
want to make some changes?

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:19.280 align:middle line:84%
He says, I would if I
knew what I would do next.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's two issues there.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Number one is, he hasn't got the
space or the emotional space,

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
the capacity to
even dream and allow

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.330 align:middle line:90%
the next thing to show up.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So my encouragement
sometimes is,

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:84%
you've got to create
the space, not just

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.853 align:middle line:84%
the physical and
mental, but sometimes

00:34:33.853 --> 00:34:38.380 align:middle line:84%
the emotional space to allow
what's next to come up.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.622 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is,
I didn't believe him.

00:34:40.622 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I looked in this man's
eyes and thinking,

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:43.550 align:middle line:90%
this guy's bullshitting me.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.100 align:middle line:90%
He's bullshitting himself.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.380 align:middle line:84%
We lie to ourselves
all the time in life.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And the science is
coming out about why--

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:84%
not just necessarily
why, but the fact

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:84%
that we lie to
ourselves as human.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.590 align:middle line:84%
We tell ourselves
stories that just

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.225 align:middle line:84%
don't exist to rationalize
and justify the fact that we

00:34:56.225 --> 00:34:57.350 align:middle line:90%
don't have to make changes.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I looked at this
man and I said--

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm sorry, but I
just don't believe you.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.545 align:middle line:84%
I said, I believe you know
exactly what you want to do.

00:35:04.545 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, no, Philip
you're not listening to me.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, if you
did, what would it look like?

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no
pressure, but we're

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.970 align:middle line:84%
going to sit here for
the next five hours

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.020 align:middle line:84%
if we have to until
you tell us what it is

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.205 align:middle line:90%
you want to do with your life.

00:35:21.205 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And eventually out
of pure frustration,

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
he goes, OK, I'd
work with people.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.163 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at him.

00:35:25.163 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, picking cotton.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And I can be
annoying on purpose.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, no,
not picking cotton.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:30.730 align:middle line:90%
I'd serve people.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:32.103 align:middle line:90%
Burgers?

00:35:32.103 --> 00:35:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said you're not
a million miles away.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.973 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'd create a
community around food.

00:35:37.973 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of people were
looking at me going, McKernan,

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.740 align:middle line:84%
can you not-- do you not
hear what he's saying?

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.960 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Leave him alone.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And the minute he said,
I'd create a community,

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:90%
something shifted in his body.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:84%
He went from his head
to his soul, his heart,

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.200 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
it and his body moved.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:90%


00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.953 align:middle line:84%
And I said, where are
you going to do this?

00:36:00.953 --> 00:36:01.870 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm not sure.

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:02.745 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, you do.

00:36:02.745 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:90%
You know exactly.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.280 align:middle line:90%
He said it'll be in Toronto.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's the neighborhood?

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.860 align:middle line:90%
He named the neighborhood.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he looks
and he goes, OK, OK.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:90%
I even have the menu.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:22.350 align:middle line:90%
He knew all the time.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Then we've gone into why
does he not want to execute

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.485 align:middle line:84%
and then the complications, then
the fears, then the concern,

00:36:29.485 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:84%
the living up to expectations,
letting people down,

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.292 align:middle line:84%
all these things
start coming up.

00:36:35.292 --> 00:36:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I have never met
a human being that

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.250 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what they want
to do for the rest of life.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Ever.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.022 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:43.022 --> 00:36:47.490 align:middle line:90%


00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.310 align:middle line:84%
People have asked
me, are you very--

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I always used to say, I'm
not a spiritual person.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a spiritual entity.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm-- and the work
that I believe we need to do

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.580 align:middle line:84%
to uncover who we really
are and therefore,

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.340 align:middle line:84%
what we're here to do,
the destiny, the gift,

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:90%
it's totally spiritual.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.220 align:middle line:90%
It's all spiritual.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.540 align:middle line:84%
People say to me a lot
that I have a gift,

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and I don't believe
that's for me to say.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel something,
but I don't believe

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:84%
it's for me to self-assess
or even identify or try

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:22.920 align:middle line:90%
to describe.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.795 align:middle line:90%
It's just not for me.

00:37:23.795 --> 00:37:25.603 align:middle line:90%
I just don't feel that--

00:37:25.603 --> 00:37:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I just don't feel
that feels respectful.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.790 align:middle line:90%
But if I do, it's on loan.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.910 align:middle line:84%
If I do have a
gift, it's on loan.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I choose to do with to
gift for the rest of my life,

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.045 align:middle line:90%
that's why I'm here.

00:37:42.045 --> 00:37:43.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm here to do.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to use the gift
that I've been given

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.370 align:middle line:90%
for a short space of time.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And if I can impart
it on to other people

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and use my gift to help
them uncover theirs,

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and they go on to
help other people,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.704 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine anything
better than that.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily
want to be remembered.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a desire
to be remembered.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to leave people
believing in themselves.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to leave people
believing they have value.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.570 align:middle line:84%
I want people to know
that they matter.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And if I get forgotten in that
process, that's OK with me.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.122 align:middle line:90%
I'm perfectly OK with that.

00:38:32.122 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:84%
There's so many people walking
around this world today that

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.340 align:middle line:84%
don't believe they matter and
don't believe they have a voice

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and don't believe that
their story matters.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.483 align:middle line:84%
Now they can point
to a stage and they

00:38:40.483 --> 00:38:43.250 align:middle line:84%
can point to "Forbes" magazine
and they can point to whatever

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.690 align:middle line:84%
as inspirational and
iconic characters

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.940 align:middle line:84%
in wealth terms or
economic terms or whatever.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say, that guy, that
girl is important, but not me.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And that has to change.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And on my watch, I will try
and change that conversation

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
as much as I possibly can,
because the only thing

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that matters in this
world is your story.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.857 align:middle line:84%
And next to that, you see,
if you can accept and embrace

00:39:06.857 --> 00:39:08.690 align:middle line:84%
your own story, maybe
you can use your story

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.720 align:middle line:90%
to help other people.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And the invitation I have
to people in recent years

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.830 align:middle line:84%
is to stop making this
journey about you.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Do the personal growth, do
a deep dive in who you are.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.905 align:middle line:84%
Understand who you are, get
in touch with your story.

00:39:19.905 --> 00:39:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Don't allow the
fear to grip you.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the absence of
clarity, take action anyway.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Keep moving, even if you're
not sure where you're going.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:30.040 align:middle line:84%
But, eventually stopped
making the journey about you.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Turn the gaze.

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Turn the mirror
away from yourself

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and say, how can I
impact other people

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and start making the rest of
your life about other people.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is a
legacy worth leaving.
