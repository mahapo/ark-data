00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.058 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here with a
friend who I met actually

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.680 align:middle line:84%
about five years ago,
we just calculated,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.770 align:middle line:84%
at an event in Mexico, and
she is a number-one New York

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Times best seller.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And I would best describe
her as a modern-day spiritual

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:90%
superwoman.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
This lady's books have
helped me and my mother,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.940 align:middle line:84%
who mostly steals them
off me before I read them,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:84%
realign a lot of our
thoughts and beliefs

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
to connect more with
spirit, and connect

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:84%
with the ultimate
power of the universe,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:84%
and know that the
universe has your back.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
She is an awesome
teacher, and it's

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
a pleasure to speak
with her to learn more

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:90%
about her life and her lessons.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Gabby, hey.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey!

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> How you doing?

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.523 align:middle line:90%
>> I loved that intro.

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:45.323 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.400 align:middle line:90%
I just made it up.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was really good.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know, Gabby, as
the spiritual warrior,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
the one promoting meditation
to people and tapping

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
into their infinite wisdom, but
what was Gabby like before she

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:90%
uncovered all this awareness?

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:90%
>> What was Gabby like?

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think I was always
on a spiritual path,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:90%
even as a child.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:84%
My mother taught me to
meditate when I was very young.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I was brought to ashrams,
and named by the gurus,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and brought up in a
spiritual household.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So that seed was planted
when I was a child.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So I had that
spiritual seed planted.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.912 align:middle line:84%
But like most adolescents, I
chose to turn my back on it.

00:01:25.912 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in high
school, I probably

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
had a little bit of
an existential crisis.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I knew that there was a world
beyond my physical sight,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
but I also was very
challenged by the worlds

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
of the perceptions I
had chosen to hook into.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a real
issue for me around these two

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.950 align:middle line:84%
to experiences that I
knew to be real for me.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
As I got a little bit
older, I got very hooked

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:90%
into that perceptual world.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I
was in my early 20s,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
I was very hooked into
what I perceived myself

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to be-- my credentials, my
access to the nightlife scene

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.760 align:middle line:84%
in New York City, the
fast-paced environment

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
that I was growing growing
to understand more.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And I really got out of
alignment in many ways.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And so far that I
got to a place where

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I was addicted to drugs
and alcohol, addicted

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to work, addicted to
romance, addicted to food--

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.485 align:middle line:90%
really hitting a bottom.

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:90%
This was at the age of 25.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.305 align:middle line:84%
So I was blessed to
hit bottom at 25.

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
That bottom was really
the catalyst for the woman

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:90%
that I am today.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
It was really the catalyst
for my greatest change.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I often love to
quote Rumi saying

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
the wound is the place
where the light enters you.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So that was my wound, and that
was where the light entered.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it was this
opportunity for me

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
to really surrender, and hit
my knees, and commit to a life

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
beyond the world of perceptions
that I had gotten so

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:90%
hooked into.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you got your
midlife crisis out of the way.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>> I really did.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:90%
I really have to say I did.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And I am so glad that I did.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's true that
sometimes that awakening can

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:90%
take a lifetime for people.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.307 align:middle line:84%
Like, for my dad, "Food Matters"
is what sort of helped him,

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't until his 50s
until he had this awakening.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, we helped him
with food and nutrition.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And now, he's going
to chanting retreats.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
He's gone off the deep
end, but it's like--

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:84%
it's taken a while,
but that's his path.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And he got there.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> He did.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit about fear versus love

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.365 align:middle line:84%
because I think this is
such an important topic.

00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
What I've found in some of
the personal stories of people

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
that I've been speaking with
and in a lot of our lives

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:84%
these days, a lot
of the goals we set,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the
relationships we attract,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.850 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the jobs that we
attract are out of fear,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
fear of not having enough
money, fear of not being loved,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.298 align:middle line:84%
fear of not being included,
so we go and include

00:03:49.298 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
ourselves in all these
social environments,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.048 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to coming from
a place of love which

00:03:53.048 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:90%
you speak about.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.445 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think we have
become so fearful as people?

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And how can people
identify if their choices

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:90%
are being made out of fear.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the presence of
fear is a sign you're relying

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:90%
on your own strength.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful message
from a course in miracles.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you identify
that you are

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
trying to control
your circumstances,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
or make something happen, or try
to force something to happen on

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
your own time, or even just
even controlling something

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, then you know
that there's fear present.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And any time in
our life when we're

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
relying on ourselves to create
or relying on ourselves to show

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
up, we're misaligned
with the truth

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of who we are, and we're out of
alignment with a higher power.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.607 align:middle line:84%
So that's the presence of fear
is when we forget that there

00:04:47.607 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
is a higher power, that there
is a presence of love within us,

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
around us, an ever-present
energy of love

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:90%
that's always supporting us.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
It's when we forget
that we get into fear.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So the way that we unlearn that
fear is through reconditioning,

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:90%
truly.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Truly reconditioning our thought
process, through conditioning

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
our belief systems,
prayer, meditation--

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
any type of spiritual
path is really

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:84%
a mental reconditioning of
unlearning fear and remembering

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of all this
that love doesn't go anywhere.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:90%
The love is always there.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And we can't actually block
it; we just forget to see it.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
we're in a dream,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.140 align:middle line:90%
we're having a nightmare.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And we wake up from that
dream and we realize that--

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.010 align:middle line:84%
the moment that we
turn on those lights,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
we realize we're just
having a nightmare.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But we have to remember that
those lights are always on,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
so we can turn those
lights on at any moment,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and we can wake up
from that dream.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of people around
this same sort of topic of fear

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.970 align:middle line:84%
develop belief systems about
themselves that are potentially

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:84%
holding them back from sort
of living their purpose,

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
living their true life-- so
a belief that I'm not pretty

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
enough, or I'm not white
enough, or dark enough skin,

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not this, or
my hair's too crazy,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:84%
or my hair's too straight,
or I don't have enough money,

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not from
the right family.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
people we've spoken

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
to have spoken about this, and
I'd like your opinion about it.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.575 align:middle line:84%
How can people identify if they
do have any limiting beliefs

00:06:19.575 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:90%
that are holding them back?

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And how can they try to sort
of recondition their thinking

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
if they have spotted
themselves or caught themselves

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:90%
in the act?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, everybody has limiting
beliefs that are holding them

00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
We all have fear-based
limiting belief systems that

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
have been ingrained in us since
childhood-- belief systems

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
of, I'm not good enough,
or belief systems of,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:90%
who am I to be great?

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:90%
Or, who am I to earn money?

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Or, how could I possibly do that
thing I've been dreaming of?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And these belief
systems are stifling us,

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.845 align:middle line:84%
and keeping us small,
and blocking us

00:06:48.845 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
from really living
in our highest

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
potential, in our
highest service,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:90%
and in our highest joy, truly.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So the first step to really
healing those belief systems

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:90%
is to witness them--

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
to witness them without any
judgment, witness our judgment

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves without
judgment, and to be

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
really conscious of what
are these belief systems,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.208 align:middle line:90%
how are they making us feel?

00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:84%
We can ask ourselves
those questions.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:90%
What is my limiting belief?

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:90%
How is it making me feel?

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And then going so far to say,
what experience from my past

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:84%
is causing me to
believe this now?

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Because all of it comes
from a root-cause condition.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a moment in time
when we separated from God,

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:84%
when we separated
from love, and then we

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.110 align:middle line:84%
have that experience
of separation,

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and then we continue to build up
a world that is a false belief

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:84%
system of fear, a false
belief system of inadequacy

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and feelings of not
being good enough.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So we continue to
repurpose and replay

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:84%
this story over and over
in so many different ways.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So we repurpose it
in our relationships,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
or in our career, or we
have the same relationship,

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
just a different
body every time.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the quickest pathway
to creating that change

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
is to first and foremost
witness it and recognize it.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be the
witness of that fear

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.350 align:middle line:90%
in order to change it.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And in that witnessing,
there's is also a willingness.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.355 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a willingness
to look at our crazy, really.

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
look at our crazy,

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.565 align:middle line:84%
and we to call it by its
name, which is "fear."

00:08:11.565 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And that really begins the
journey of undoing the fear

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:90%
and unlearning the fear.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
The first step is
crucial because

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:84%
without that willingness and
that desire to witness and look

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
at it, we can't have
the catalyst for change.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.581 align:middle line:84%
We can't have the
desire to change.

00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have
to really open up

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to a belief system
beyond our own.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
create that change

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of the
transformation of a belief

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:84%
system that has held
us back for a lifetime,

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:84%
requires a spiritual connection,
a spiritual awareness,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.388 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:08:49.388 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:90%
There's many things you can do.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
There's many personal growth
tools that you can use.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's beautiful
therapy practices.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's spirit
and God in all that.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.053 align:middle line:84%
I believe that spirit works
through those doctors,

00:08:59.053 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and works through
those self-help books,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and works through those
different practitioners,

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and yoga teachers, and
meditation instructors,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:90%
or whoever you may be guided to.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when you open up with
a willingness to change,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:90%
you will be guided.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
You'll be guided to the teacher,
the yoga instructor, the book--

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:90%
maybe to this film.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.088 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, beautiful.

00:09:20.088 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, and I love that, too.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.797 align:middle line:84%
Because even with-- I'm not sure
if you're familiar with-- is it

00:09:23.797 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Marshall Rosenberg?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.855 align:middle line:90%
"Nonviolent Communication?"

00:09:25.855 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting
book, anyway.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:84%
It talks about
conflict resolution.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.550 align:middle line:84%
The first point is
just acknowledging

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that there's that conflict or
there's that inner dialogue.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And that often does
a lot of the healing.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Even the awareness
itself can be the healing

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.480 align:middle line:90%
because it's a realization.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a realization, but
you have to make sure that

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.193 align:middle line:84%
you're witnessing
it without judgment.

00:09:42.193 --> 00:09:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Because often we can witness
our craziness or our attack

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
thoughts and judge
ourselves more

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
for having it for being
in that low space,

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.010 align:middle line:84%
for having those
negative belief systems.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.115 align:middle line:84%
So we want to witness our
judgment without judgment.

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Because that
self-beration can lead it

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.960 align:middle line:90%
to it even further worse.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it just
perpetuates the problem.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.925 align:middle line:84%
>> With regards to
manifestation, though,

00:10:04.925 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:84%
since "The Secret" came
out, everyone's like,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
visualize my ideal life."

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot
of the people that we've

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:84%
spoken to in this film
have used visualizations.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Novak Djokovic
created a make-believe trophy

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.192 align:middle line:90%
of Wimbledon when he was six.

00:10:19.192 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
He visualized winning
Wimbledon, becoming

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.900 align:middle line:90%
number one in the world.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And he eventually, sort
of against all odds,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:90%
did on the same day.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a crazy story.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So these sort of things
happen all the time.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.705 align:middle line:84%
But if you could speak
about visualization

00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and its importance
and potential if you

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.277 align:middle line:84%
want to touch on the difference
between wanting versus knowing?

00:10:36.277 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a really
important distinction.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Because people visualize,
like, I want this.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:90%
I want that.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:90%
I want this.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's like hang on, maybe
you're a bit off there.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So tell me about your
thoughts on visualization,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:84%
its importance, and
power and that sort

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
of duality or dichotomy
around using that language.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, manifesting is all
about aligning with the energy

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.910 align:middle line:90%
of joy.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So if a visualization
makes you feel good,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:90%
then you're manifesting.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
If visualizing something that
you don't have doesn't make you

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
feel good, makes you
feel lack, or insecurity,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
or as though
something's missing,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.760 align:middle line:84%
then that wouldn't be the
tool to use because it's

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.463 align:middle line:90%
all about feeling good.

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why visualization
works for so many people

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:84%
because holding that image that
makes you ignite a feeling,

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's that feeling
that is magnetic.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:84%
It's that feeling that puts
you into alignment with God,

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:90%
with the universe, with source.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
In that space of
alignment, you become what

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I call a "super attractor."

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
You start to magnetize
towards you what you desire.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
You start to become a
match for the things

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that you think
about, but as long

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.960 align:middle line:90%
as you're in a presence of joy.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:84%
You're a match for the things
you think about even when

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:84%
you're not in the
presence of joy,

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
but those are things
you don't want.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So if it's visualization
that makes you feel good,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and it empowers you, and it
lights you up to see that--

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
for me, I visualized myself
sitting next to Oprah Winfrey

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:90%
for a decade before I did.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:90%
But it made me feel good.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the feeling of
being interviewed by Oprah,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
or holding that
baby in your arms,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:90%
or having that abundance--

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.538 align:middle line:84%
so making sure that
that feels good.

00:12:08.538 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything about
that visualization that

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.411 align:middle line:84%
doesn't feel good, then we
want to find another tool.

00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.252 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:12:15.252 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I guess that covers the
wanting component, too.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.032 align:middle line:84%
Because the wanting is like
acknowledging a sense of luck,

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:84%
would you say that's
the reason why

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that might be a
trap for people that

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.458 align:middle line:90%
are using mental imagery or--

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a big
difference between wanting

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:90%
and knowing.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with wanting and wanting

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
when it's coming from a
place-- when there's a desire

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and that desire is coming from
a place of a belief system of,

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I can have this, I'm
capable, I'm worthy,

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.050 align:middle line:84%
then that desire
has a lot of power.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:90%
That desire is really magnetic.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
When that desire comes from
place of neediness, or control,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.345 align:middle line:84%
or in any way trying to
manipulate, then that that's

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:54.720 align:middle line:84%
where we sort of
muddy the water.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
That's where we begin to get
out of alignment with what

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:90%
it is that we want to attract.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.485 align:middle line:90%
And we know the difference.

00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So we always have to
check in with ourselves.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:90%
How does this make me feel?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.377 align:middle line:84%
If I feel tense, or
if I feel anxious,

00:13:05.377 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
or if I feel like I'm
trying to control an outcome

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
or I'm obsessing
over a timeline,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:90%
then we're in the way.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:90%
We're manifesting.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.480 align:middle line:84%
When we're in an energy that's
released and surrendered,

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:84%
that's when we can really let
those desires do their thing.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:84%
We can we can let
them magnetized

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and multiply and
allow whatever it

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
is that we're attracting
to come into form

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:90%
when it is the highest good.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the thing that
really gets people tripped up

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
is the when and the how.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
When we are in the
space of knowing,

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
there's a beautiful message
from a course in miracles.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Those who are certain
of the outcome

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.000 align:middle line:84%
can afford to wait and
wait without anxiety.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.596 align:middle line:90%
How awesome is that?

00:13:47.596 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:90%
That's so good.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in that
place of knowing,

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:84%
we can afford to wait
and wait without anxiety.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that when
we have a belief system, when

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:84%
we believe in a world
beyond our physical sight,

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
when we have any type of
metaphysical belief systems,

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
we can really begin to
develop a world view that's

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
less controlling and
less on our timeline,

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and much more
surrendered and free.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.647 align:middle line:84%
And that's the lifestyle
that I've aimed for daily.

00:14:18.647 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Every single day, I always say,
when I think I've surrendered,

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:90%
I surrender more.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Because my goal is to just feel
good and allow my desires--

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to be unapologetic about
my desires, but to not

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
get in the way, to not
try to control them.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that
has a lot to do--

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.543 align:middle line:84%
and I'm probably jumping
ahead here a little bit--

00:14:38.543 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:90%
with regards to intention?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that some
people might start a business,

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
for instance, or an
idea, and their intention

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:90%
might be off kilter.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to having
an intention to truly

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:84%
serve and to want to solve
an important problem,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.750 align:middle line:84%
their intention might be,
I just want to pay my bills

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
or I want a
Lamborghini so that I

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.765 align:middle line:90%
can attract hot women or guys.

00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not sure many
women would want a Lamborghini.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But do you think
that intention has

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.732 align:middle line:84%
something to do with
being able to fully relax?

00:15:06.732 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
this sense of knowing

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:84%
and you know your
intention is pure,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine it's a lot
easier just to be like,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.570 align:middle line:90%
I know this is going to happen.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>> However, if you're sort
of off kilter with regards

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:84%
to intention, could that
potentially affect it?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And how do people know if
they've got a pure intention

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:90%
or not?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, here's the thing.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.640 align:middle line:84%
If you have an intention
to get something

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.250 align:middle line:84%
because it feels good, then it's
going to come into your life.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just trying to
get that thing to feel good,

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
you'll keep staying on this
endless search for something

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.590 align:middle line:84%
more, something
more, something more.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So the greatest intention
is to just feel good.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the wonderful thing
is that when we really

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:84%
make our biggest
desire, our greatest

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.072 align:middle line:84%
desire to feel
good, then the irony

00:15:50.072 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:90%
is all the things come to us.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So we always think,
OK, I'll feel happy

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:90%
when I have that car.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I'll feel happy when
I have that money.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But the complete
opposite is true.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.288 align:middle line:84%
When I'm happy,
I'll have that car.

00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:84%
When I'm happy, I'll
have that money.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:84%
We allow more to come to us
when we're in a state of grace.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's our work
is to really just get

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
into the intention
of feeling good.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:84%
The intention of attracting
something into your life

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%
is totally fine.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Just let yourself attract
what you want, but always

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
in the pursuit of feeling good
and not because of the thing.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.050 align:middle line:90%
Let feeling good be first.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Of course when we're in any
type of intention to serve,

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.460 align:middle line:84%
we will be very likely to
attract a lot towards us

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because when we do dwell
in an energy of service,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.725 align:middle line:90%
we feel really good.

00:16:38.725 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:84%
This keeps coming
back to feeling good.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:90%
You got that?

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:84%
When we're in an energy of
service, we feel really good.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling is
what's attracting.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's why a service-oriented
business is always

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.970 align:middle line:84%
going to thrive
because you're going

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
to be in a daily alignment
with the truth of who you are,

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
with your oneness, and your
service, and your gifting.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.825 align:middle line:84%
The gifting energy is
what really attracts.

00:17:04.825 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't know
if you can cover this

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:09.998 align:middle line:90%
from a different angle.

00:17:09.998 --> 00:17:13.092 align:middle line:90%
But in the developed world--

00:17:13.092 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:84%
and Brendan talks
about this a little bit

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:84%
and a few other people,
especially the '80s and '90s,

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:84%
we've become addicted
to this idea of, attain

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.780 align:middle line:84%
material possessions and
we'll achieve happiness.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So I want to come from this
from another angle, if we could.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.425 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have, I don't know,
30, 40 million people on SSI

00:17:29.425 --> 00:17:30.550 align:middle line:90%
and antidepressants.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:84%
We've got a vacuum of
happiness, and we've

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:84%
got a real sense of
depression and anxiety

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%
about the future and worry.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're still
on this path to--

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
that I just need to get
that corner office job.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I just need to get this thing,
and it'll make me happy.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit of a different
angle than visualization

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.785 align:middle line:84%
and manifestation we
just talked about that.

00:17:53.785 --> 00:17:55.555 align:middle line:84%
But how do you think
people can really

00:17:55.555 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
achieve a sense of happiness in
their life and a sense of peace

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.841 align:middle line:90%
in their life?

00:17:59.841 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I think when we
give up our objectives,

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.593 align:middle line:84%
that's when we really
become happier.

00:18:06.593 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a strange thing for me
to be saying that because I've

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:84%
spent so many years very
goal-oriented, and really

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:90%
mission driven.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And I really worked my
ass off for many years,

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'm proud that I did
because, as a result,

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
I've published seven books, and
I've helped a lot of people,

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's healed many people,
and served in many ways,

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:90%
but I wasn't happy.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.407 align:middle line:90%
I'm admitting that.

00:18:30.407 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:90%
I was happy along the way.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.660 align:middle line:84%
There was things that brought
me joy and excitement.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But there was something really,
really deeply missing for me.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:84%
The greatest joy that's come
for me is really just giving it

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
all up to saying,
how would you use me?

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Getting out of the way and
letting people support me more,

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.605 align:middle line:84%
and really focusing on the
things that really bring

00:18:49.605 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
me the most joy,
rather than the things

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.756 align:middle line:90%
I think I need to accomplish.

00:18:53.756 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, this is an
interesting full circle for you

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:90%
and your life, in a way.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this
is a little bit more

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of Buddhism,
Buddhism practices.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.942 align:middle line:90%
There's this art.

00:19:04.942 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:84%
One spiritual teacher in my
life, [INAUDIBLE],, godfather,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and thankfully, because
he brought up his kids

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:90%
in ashrams--

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:84%
very successful businessman,
too. he signed a 100 million

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.500 align:middle line:84%
euro deal, and then go and chant
the Guru Gita for two hours,

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:17.565 --> 00:19:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] yoga path, and
he connected me with that,

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and that became the
guidance from "Food Matters"

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.970 align:middle line:84%
over the last 10,
15 years, really.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the practices
he talks about--

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and I practice it, too, when
we hit a level of success,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and we had this one week
where we made like $1 million

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:90%
in 10 days.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:90%
He was like, oh my god.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:90%
This is just transformative.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.865 align:middle line:84%
This was about, I don't
know, five years ago.

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:41.032 align:middle line:84%
And I went down on the beach
and did this meditation

00:19:41.032 --> 00:19:42.515 align:middle line:84%
and just burned
it all in my mind.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't
want to be owned

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
by this idea of just
more, more, more.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that you're sort
of moving to this path of not

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
being attached to
the outcome and just

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
being more present
in the process

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and not caring
where that takes you

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.166 align:middle line:84%
because you know that
you're just guided in a way?

00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:03.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there is a
tremendous amount of guidance

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
that I don't see with my
physical eye, most of the time.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I see things.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:90%
But I believe in that guidance.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
my primary job

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:84%
is to just in alignment
with that source.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And as I align, I can
hear that guidance.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
I can allow that guidance
to show up in my life,

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:90%
open invisible doors--

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:84%
write through me,
speak through me,

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
just move through me
in magnificent ways.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, there's
plenty of things

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I get hung up about, things
that are out of my control,

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
but I continue to come back
to that space of surrender.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Because, as a human, I'm having
a human experience of wanting

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and trying to control
timing of things

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
that are completely
out of my hands.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.300 align:middle line:90%
But those are momentary lapses.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And my fear-based belief
systems are far less aggressive

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:90%
than they used to be.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've transformed
that fear into faith.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've chosen to allow that
faith muscle to be stronger.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that I measure
my spiritual success based

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.723 align:middle line:90%
on how perfectly aligned I am.

00:21:17.723 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I really measure it based
on how quickly I come back

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.771 align:middle line:90%
to alignment.

00:21:21.771 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> That's cool because you're
sort of then not judging

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:90%
yourself in a way.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
You're not judging yourself
that you got out of alignment.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.767 align:middle line:84%
I would be judging myself
all day because there's so

00:21:29.767 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:90%
many moments of misalignment.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.701 align:middle line:90%
So I focus on the comeback rate.

00:21:34.701 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a good message
that I needed to hear.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:84%
How do you practice
getting in alignment?

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're a huge
proponent of meditation.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you
suggest for everybody?

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Or what sort of techniques,
or tools, or strategies

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.920 align:middle line:84%
could people start
using in order

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to get more in alignment,
to acknowledge that they are

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:84%
perfect, that they
have everything,

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
has their backs?

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
What do you
recommend for people?

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I recommend any type of daily
conscious contact with a higher

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
power of your own understanding,
whether it be a prayer

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
in the morning,
or an affirmation,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%
or if you do any type of
yogic practice or meditation

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
practice, where you spend a
minimum of five minutes a day

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
connecting to a higher power
of your own understanding.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:84%
That's really my
aim is not to say,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
this is what God is to
anyone, but to just crack

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.410 align:middle line:84%
people open to choose
what that means to them.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So establishing that maybe
today your higher power

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.142 align:middle line:84%
is just the presence
of joy within you.

00:22:43.142 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your higher power is the
voice of your inner guidance

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your higher
power is the energy

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of the universe-- whatever
you choose to believe in.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.860 align:middle line:84%
But consciously aligning
your thoughts with love

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:84%
puts you into that state,
that energy presence.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:90%
So it begins with the thoughts.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It begins with transcending
your fear-based belief systems.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And it really begins the
moment that you wake up.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment you wake up,
you begin to create momentum.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And that momentum can take
you down to crazy town

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.152 align:middle line:84%
or it can take you
to a place that you

00:23:16.152 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:84%
want to stay in-- a really
good high-vibe energy that

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
can really be the
catalyst for a great day,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
can really guide you through
those amazing, amazing

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
experiences, and
great relationships,

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and feelings of
feeling fulfilled.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's the choice that you
make the moment you wake up.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And I believe having some kind
of way of tuning in early on

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.040 align:middle line:84%
can really begin to change not
just your day, but your life,

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course,
returning to those practices

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.430 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So those small practices--
maybe breath, maybe

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.130 align:middle line:84%
choosing to ask yourself,
what's the best feeling

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.370 align:middle line:90%
thought I can have right now?

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:90%
So you're in a stuck place?

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.900 align:middle line:90%
You're in a negative thought?

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:84%
What's the best feeling
I can have right now?

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And just thinking
your way out and so

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:90%
many different situations.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
I always say that happiness
is a choice we make.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.053 align:middle line:84%
So we have to, in any
given moment, choose again.

00:24:10.053 --> 00:24:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's really cool.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.673 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the priming
in the morning is so important.

00:24:14.673 --> 00:24:16.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the experts has said
in one of the interviews

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.733 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
statistic-- and I'm

00:24:19.733 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:84%
trapped to this
statistic at the moment,

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:84%
because I'm on the
road, and I want

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.822 align:middle line:84%
to check in with my
family every day.

00:24:23.822 --> 00:24:26.890 align:middle line:84%
But 86% of smartphone users
check their phone first thing

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:84%
they do in the
morning, as opposed

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
to sort of having
control over their day.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to people
who are a little bit trapped

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:84%
in giving their power
away in the morning?

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, turn off your phone
before you go to sleep or put

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:90%
it on airplane mode.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So I either have it off,
or on airplane mode,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.013 align:middle line:90%
or in another room.

00:24:44.013 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Arianna Huffington actually
gave me this present one time.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.340 align:middle line:84%
She gave me this
little tiny box.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And it had silk
sheets and pillows,

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:90%
and it was a bed for my iPhone.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.300 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It even had a
charger built into it.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, put your
iPhone outside your room

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.200 align:middle line:90%
and tuck it in.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Because she's on such a
mission to help people sleep.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, I'm on a mission
to help people feel better.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, go get your Arianna
Huffington silk sheets

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:90%
and bed for your iPhone.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Tuck it away.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Definitely do not begin
your day with a device.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It is terrifying
what happens when

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.610 align:middle line:90%
we begin our days that way.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.620 align:middle line:84%
We go right into
fight or flight.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:90%
We have a trigger response.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:84%
We get hooked into
dramas and negativity.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:84%
We totally disconnect
from any opportunity

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.490 align:middle line:84%
to connect with God because
we're off to the races, right?

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:90%
So it's a simple experiment.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Wake up and check your phone.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
wake up and don't.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:90%
See how you feel.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:90%
See how your day goes.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, look at
what generally comes up

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:90%
on your phone.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like death, pain,
fire, destruction,

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not enough.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it's a
recipe for disaster.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.685 align:middle line:90%
>> The judgment device.

00:25:49.685 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.048 align:middle line:84%
How do you think people
can best heal past trauma?

00:25:56.048 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a
lot of people, when

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.120 align:middle line:84%
they start to develop a
sense of self awareness,

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.960 align:middle line:84%
they're like, oh, shit, I'm
doing that because I was abused

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
as a child, or I was raped,
or my father was an alcoholic

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and he was addicted, or
et cetera, et cetera.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Once people start to go deeper
in that self work and the self

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:84%
sort of third-person awareness
of their actions and belief

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:19.437 align:middle line:84%
systems, then they start to
go, jeez, how do I heal this?

00:26:19.437 --> 00:26:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I know you mentioned, you'll
get guided through a healer

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:22.728 align:middle line:90%
or something like this.

00:26:22.728 --> 00:26:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But specifically around
trauma, how can people

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:30.495 align:middle line:84%
try to find peace with that or
use that as a tool for change?

00:26:30.495 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Trauma's an
interesting topic for me.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I actually remember
a childhood trauma.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:90%
So many of us--

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.838 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna speak for
those of us out there

00:26:38.838 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
who dissociate from
traumatic events,

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:44.210 align:middle line:90%
particularly when we're a child.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, I tucked
it away and remember it

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
at 36, which was one of the
most terrifying and liberating

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:90%
moments of my life.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But I never understood
why did I become

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.020 align:middle line:90%
a drug addict and alcoholic.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Why did I become addicted to
relationships and co-dependent.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Why was I a food addict?

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:02.875 align:middle line:90%
What was the why?

00:27:02.875 --> 00:27:04.250 align:middle line:84%
I thought everything
was so good.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:84%
But many of us, whether
we literally remember

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
the traumatic event or have
completely dissociated from it,

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.530 align:middle line:84%
have many mechanisms for
running from that pain,

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
running from the trauma,
anesthesizing that trauma.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:90%
That's why we drink.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.230 align:middle line:90%
It's why we overwork.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.670 align:middle line:90%
It's why we overachieve.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It's why we self-sabotage.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
trauma is the root cause

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:90%
of most addictive behaviors.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.097 align:middle line:84%
So if there's addicts listening,
I've been sober 12 years now.

00:27:32.097 --> 00:27:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
trauma was the root

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:84%
cause of my addictive behavior,
because I was running.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:90%
I was anesthesizing.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:90%
I was avoiding.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I was doing anything I could
to not remember and not feel.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that the
cat was out of the bag,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and I actually did
have the recollection,

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and the memory came back to
me, as terrifying and fearful

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.520 align:middle line:84%
as that was for me, it was
also this incredible liberating

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:84%
experience of finally
feeling like I

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:middle line:90%
don't have to run anymore.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So in the last 2 and 1/2
years, really three years,

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I've been getting my
life back because I

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.210 align:middle line:90%
haven't been running anymore.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
to face the trauma,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
to accept that you
have been traumatized,

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to accept that these
events are real,

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:90%
and to choose to stop running.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.870 align:middle line:90%
That's scary.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been the ways
that we've been running

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.470 align:middle line:84%
have been the ways that
we've "stayed safe,"

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.270 align:middle line:84%
but there's really
nothing safe about that.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
True safety lies in our
freedom from it, not

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.350 align:middle line:90%
from the running from it.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So some things I
really recommend

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:84%
for people who
are healing trauma

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:84%
is emotional freedom
technique, EFT, otherwise known

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.010 align:middle line:90%
as tapping.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It's something I teach and
practice in my own trauma

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:84%
EMDR is eye movement,
desensitization,

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:90%
and reprocessing.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Please make sure I
said that correctly.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And EMDR is a beautiful
practice of reprogramming

00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
the neural pathways through
bilateral brain functioning

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and really unlocking the
amygdala to release the trauma.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And with EFT and EMDR,
really what's happening

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:84%
is you're healing the emotional
disturbance that lives

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.200 align:middle line:90%
beneath the traumatic event.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And so when you can heal
that emotional disturbance,

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:84%
then you can be released
of that fight or flight.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is a big suggestion.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the place of
recognizing identifying trauma

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and becoming
prepared to heal it,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.910 align:middle line:84%
stay in prayer to find,
or attract, or seek

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:35.090 align:middle line:84%
the right healer that's going
to be the safest healer for you.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Because my prayers
for healing guided me

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
to a team of very talented
therapists, spiritual healers,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.200 align:middle line:84%
EMDR experts, who
I've built up and I've

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:84%
had the privilege of
being able to work with.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Now if someone is saying, OK,
I can't afford a therapist;

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I can't afford that, there's
many resources out there.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of EFT
videos for free on YouTube.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I promise to write
a book on trauma

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that I'll give to anybody
that can afford it.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm on a mission
have helping people

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:84%
heal their traumatic wounds
so that they can be free,

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and freedom is on
the other side.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel like, what
is my life without this

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's been
so debilitating.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.975 align:middle line:84%
But I do promise
anyone that's watching

00:30:21.975 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:84%
that there is freedom
on the other side

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
because I'm
experiencing it myself.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.258 align:middle line:84%
It comes with commitment
and a real desire to change.

00:30:29.258 --> 00:30:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's fascinating
because there was a lady that

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:84%
recently published a talk
from Ted about the A studies,

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] and so forth,
adverse childhood experiences

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:84%
study and how a lot of children
that have gone through that

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
potentially not had the tools
or techniques to identify it

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and help heal it suffer from
all sorts of increased rates

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.860 align:middle line:90%
of chronic disease and so forth.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It messes up your microbiome.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Childhood trauma
affects your microbiome.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It affects your nervous
system on all levels.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I rake my teeth at night.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And these are all just sort
of subtle energy systems

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:90%
that need to just be unwound.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.100 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah, I think that--

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.170 align:middle line:84%
the other thing is,
for parents out there,

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:16.280 align:middle line:84%
learning how to identify the
trauma in their children.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Because the sooner that you
can start to help a child

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.096 align:middle line:84%
heal from a traumatic event,
you can redirect your life.

00:31:22.096 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk a little bit
about stress, in particular.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we get stress in
so many different forms.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.420 align:middle line:84%
We get it from judging
ourselves for not being enough.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:90%
We get it from terrorists.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:84%
We get it from
judgment in a way of,

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I have less money
than that person.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.183 align:middle line:84%
And then we get it in
terms, of I'm late for work

00:31:42.183 --> 00:31:43.100 align:middle line:90%
or I need to be there.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.915 align:middle line:90%
So we're living in 24/7 stress.

00:31:45.915 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, the World
Health Organization

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.820 align:middle line:84%
is like, stress is
going to be the biggest

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.460 align:middle line:84%
cause of chronic degenerative
disease in the next sort

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.132 align:middle line:84%
of title 20 years because of how
it affects our immune system.

00:31:55.132 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:84%
What are ways that people can
move through stress with more

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:02.120 align:middle line:84%
grace and ease and start to find
a better path through stress?

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the things
that we have to do to heal

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.360 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to stress--
it's a relationship--

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:17.900 align:middle line:84%
is to give ourself
permission to slow down.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I think that a
lot of people live

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.120 align:middle line:84%
in a chronic state of stress
because of the expectations

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that they place upon themselves
and also the trauma, right?

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're running from that
trauma in many different ways.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:90%
They're avoiding feeling.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we're avoiding
feeling, we're doing.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:84%
In that excessive
doing, we're stressing.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's often a
huge cause of stress.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Or there's a belief system,
like we spoke about earlier,

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:90%
a belief system of limitations.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not good enough unless
I'm doing, or creating,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.190 align:middle line:84%
or making things happen and
that creates a stressed state.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So there's is a
huge, huge element

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.960 align:middle line:84%
in healing stress
about giving yourself

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.267 align:middle line:90%
permission to do nothing.

00:33:00.267 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself
permission to slow down.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself
permission to be still.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you're
thinking, OK, well,

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:84%
I have to go to work
every day, Gabby.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Or, I have five children,
how do I not do nothing?

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Even for a moment in
your day, to do nothing,

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
that's why meditation is so
effective, and so important

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.395 align:middle line:90%
in stress reduction.

00:33:16.395 --> 00:33:18.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
ways to heal stress

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.700 align:middle line:90%
is transcendental meditation.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Two 20-minute mantra-based
meditations twice a day

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.480 align:middle line:84%
has the power to completely
lower your cortisol levels

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:84%
way more than even a
full night's sleep.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.215 align:middle line:90%
So there's tools out there.

00:33:30.215 --> 00:33:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But the first step is
to really give yourself

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:33.882 align:middle line:84%
permission to slow down
and giving yourself

00:33:33.882 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:90%
permission to do nothing.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And that nothingness can come
on your meditation pillow

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.080 align:middle line:90%
or that nothingness can come--

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.540 align:middle line:84%
even if you give yourself
five minutes in the morning

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.640 align:middle line:84%
to sit with your
tea and look out

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.150 align:middle line:84%
the window with no
device near you at all,

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:84%
with no to-do list in your
mind but to do nothing.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I can speak to this with
authority and conviction

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.942 align:middle line:84%
because I have only learned
it in the last month.

00:33:57.942 --> 00:33:59.900 align:middle line:84%
You're really getting me
at a good time, James.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So in the past
month, I hit a bottom

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
with a physical condition
because that came about because

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.000 align:middle line:90%
of stress.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And this was really recently.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:90%
This was two months ago.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, unfortunately,
bottoms work for me.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Bottoming out is usually the
catalyst for great change.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So I hit another bottom
and I decided to redirect.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:84%
So I had no more
tolerance for it.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have to
become no longer tolerant

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:84%
of the behaviors that we have
if we want to truly change them.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that was part of what
helped me get clean and sober.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer tolerant
of feeling like crap

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:90%
and feeling hung over.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.710 align:middle line:90%
So this was the same.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.659 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer
tolerant of putting

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:84%
my body under that
type of stress

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and putting my life
in such danger.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:54.403 align:middle line:84%
So I made a big commitment
to reorganize and redirect.

00:34:54.403 --> 00:34:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And that didn't
mean that I didn't

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.448 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of responsibilities.

00:34:57.448 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Because all of this started
I was on a book tour.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I had travel.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:84%
There was plenty of things
I had to show up for.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But I was still able to
make that mental shift,

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.090 align:middle line:84%
even in the midst of
showing up for life.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
say, oh, it sounds so nice.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.300 align:middle line:84%
You can just go off
and be at an ashram.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:90%
That's not what happened for me.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:90%
I created an inner ashram.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I made the commitment
to change my intentions

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:90%
and change my behavior.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And the irony is the pulling
back, how much I pulled back,

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.260 align:middle line:90%
how much I slowed down--

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I had one of most successful
months of my entire life--

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.842 align:middle line:84%
one of the most successful
months of my entire life.

00:35:29.842 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
the months that I

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.790 align:middle line:84%
did the least amount
that I'd ever done,

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.940 align:middle line:84%
even showing up for everything,
but just doing less--

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.420 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of that doing
is sort of unnecessary doing--

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and allowing myself to
receive more support,

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and allowing myself
even just moments

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:84%
like sitting in the
bathtub in the morning

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and staring out the
window for 10 minutes

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:56.170 align:middle line:84%
was a real way of reorganizing
that pattern of stress.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Because stress is an
addictive pattern.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So like any addiction,
we have to replace it

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:01.762 align:middle line:90%
with a new behavior.

00:36:01.762 --> 00:36:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And, in my case, I started
replacing it with many new

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:07.570 align:middle line:84%
behaviors-- cooking for
myself, nourishing myself,

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:13.060 align:middle line:84%
taking a bath, going for a walk,
listening to music and actually

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:84%
letting the music move
me, saying no to things--

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
saying no, saying no, saying
no, and then saying no more.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I said
yes to things I had

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to say yes to because I
had chosen to do something,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I had to show up for it, I did
it with a different energy,

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:84%
did it with a
different attitude.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Rather than trying
to overly achieve,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I just said, let me have a
good time while I'm doing this.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, once again, making
fun more of a priority

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.637 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest ways
to decrease your stress.

00:36:39.637 --> 00:36:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>> That's really beautiful
because I think you're really

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.400 align:middle line:84%
touching on this
masculine-feminine energy.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I got deep into David
Deida's work a number of years

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:84%
ago, got recommended it three
times by three different people

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.200 align:middle line:90%
on three different continents.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.825 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, that's it
I'm going to do it.

00:36:53.825 --> 00:36:57.258 align:middle line:84%
So [INAUDIBLE] I was like,
well, OK, game changer.

00:36:57.258 --> 00:36:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Then that was on
New Year's Day, so I

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.008 align:middle line:90%
call it New Year's Deida now.

00:37:00.008 --> 00:37:02.282 align:middle line:84%
Every New Year's Day, I
read a David Deida book.

00:37:02.282 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that came out there

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.700 align:middle line:84%
was really understanding
that masculine-feminine.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.992 align:middle line:90%
And I see it in business a lot.

00:37:06.992 --> 00:37:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, I get these moments
of just extraordinary months

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.690 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes years of
extraordinary drive,

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.250 align:middle line:84%
then like just push,
push, push at any cost.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, like you
said, sometimes there's

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that experience of just
tapping more into the feminine

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.433 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that things are
going to be OK and relaxing.

00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:24.120 align:middle line:90%
And then, things show up.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Things happen.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that, I guess
that that experience of being

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.490 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of craziness but
then adopting that ideology

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:84%
because you can have
the crazy schedule,

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:38.742 align:middle line:90%
but just-- you know what?

00:37:38.742 --> 00:37:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to show up.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:41.443 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be present.

00:37:41.443 --> 00:37:42.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be there.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And I know that things
will work out perfectly.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.945 align:middle line:84%
And then, to me, that's
a belief system in a way.

00:37:46.945 --> 00:37:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And everything does work out
perfectly when you're in that

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.180 align:middle line:84%
place, when you're in that
place of non-resistance.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it's our resistance
that makes things tough,

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that creates a feeling
of, I can't get that done;

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:84%
or, it's such a struggle,
or I'm not having fun,

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:03.430 align:middle line:90%
but I'm achieving.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.560 align:middle line:84%
But the moment we start
to release the resistance,

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.060 align:middle line:84%
we just start to feel
an energy behind us,

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.780 align:middle line:84%
just moving us,
and directing us.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can almost feel
as though we can do more

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:18.350 align:middle line:84%
without even trying
that hard, or we

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:22.350 align:middle line:84%
can achieve more or attract
more without doing that much.

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really about getting
into a space of non resistance.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> How do people not react?

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so many
things that get thrown at us--

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
death, failure, didn't get the
job, that business idea didn't

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:36.890 align:middle line:90%
work or so forth.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And years and years of
spiritual practice, I've

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.778 align:middle line:84%
started to get to a point where
I'm like, oh, how exciting.

00:38:43.778 --> 00:38:45.820 align:middle line:84%
If something doesn't go
right, I'm like, oh, wow.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.320 align:middle line:84%
What's seeking to emerge
from this, you know?

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.480 align:middle line:90%
But that's taken me a long time.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of play with
it now, which might

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.230 align:middle line:90%
seem crazy to a lot of people.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But how do you think people can,
amidst the craziest opposition,

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:04.310 align:middle line:84%
craziest tragedy, try to find
message, try to find hope,

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:84%
try to find peace, try to
find even the perfection

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and know that it's
there to serve them?

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:90%
How can they get to that point?

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that having
spiritual faith gives you

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.870 align:middle line:84%
a foundation where you can
trust even when things go wrong,

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and you can believe it
when you don't see it,

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel connected,
even when something has been

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.748 align:middle line:90%
devastating.

00:39:28.748 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And that connection
is what we really

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:84%
need to rely on most
when things go wrong.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.632 align:middle line:84%
It's when things are going right
that we can forget that we have

00:39:35.632 --> 00:39:37.340 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual path, but
it's when things go

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:90%
wrong we were deeply need it.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:90%
We always truly need it.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So what I have found is
it's not about not reacting

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.460 align:middle line:90%
when something happens.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the process
of returning to love

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.625 align:middle line:84%
is allowing yourself to
be present with the fear,

00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and the emotions,
and the feelings that

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:58.252 align:middle line:84%
do arise, and then witnessing
those fear-based belief

00:39:58.252 --> 00:40:00.710 align:middle line:84%
systems, and offering them up
through prayer, offering them

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:04.310 align:middle line:84%
up to your higher power,
and really saying,

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:08.000 align:middle line:84%
reveal to me how I can
see this with light.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Help me see the miracle in this.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And miracles are seen in
light, so really asking

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.260 align:middle line:90%
for that vision to be shifted.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But we can't always
do it on our own.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what having a
spiritual practice is about

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.630 align:middle line:84%
is trusting that there's
is an intermediary,

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:25.670 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
inner wisdom that

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
can take your
fear-based belief system

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and bridge those thoughts
from that fear-based world

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to the light, to the love, to
the magnitude, to the healing,

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.720 align:middle line:84%
to the lesson, to all
the things that we

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.510 align:middle line:84%
can perceive with a more
positive perspective.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have
to expect ourselves

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.880 align:middle line:84%
to make that shift on our
own, particularly when

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:90%
something tragic has occurred.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.040 align:middle line:90%
That's where prayer comes in.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.760 align:middle line:84%
We allow ourselves
to humbly pray,

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to offer up those
fear-based belief

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.930 align:middle line:84%
systems and those
tragedies, and help

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.580 align:middle line:90%
us perceive them differently.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And just being in that
prayer, you'll be led.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
How can people, in a sort
of similar vein around,

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I guess jealousy or
judgment-- because there's

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:11.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times when people start
on the path of tapping more

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.480 align:middle line:84%
into their infinite
wisdom and handing over

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.240 align:middle line:84%
their power to a
divine force, but then

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:21.270 align:middle line:84%
find themselves jealous
of someone else's success

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:middle line:84%
or really judging themselves
because they haven't

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.190 align:middle line:90%
achieved a certain amount.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, how do people sort
of move out of, I guess--

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to attack
[INAUDIBLE] horrible language.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It's very Australian
of me, very brutal,

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
but how do we approach
this from another angle?

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Especially, I think,
around jealousy

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.143 align:middle line:90%
of other people's success?

00:41:47.143 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a problem that a lot
of people come up against.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.518 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm so spiritual, but
that bitch, she got this.

00:41:51.518 --> 00:41:52.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's happening
all the time.

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> How can people develop an
awareness of that and try to be

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:59.375 align:middle line:84%
more humble or spiritual
in that process?

00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen a lot of people
wake up spiritually but still

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.685 align:middle line:84%
want to hold on
to their judgment.

00:42:07.685 --> 00:42:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.540 align:middle line:84%
What I would say
to those folks is,

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.600 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
truly know what it's

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.350 align:middle line:84%
like to be in
alignment with God,

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.080 align:middle line:84%
then forgive that person
that you've judged.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Truly forgive.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Learn the practice
of forgiveness.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Learn what it means to transform
a judgment into a holy love.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Learn that.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Really surrender to that.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a whole book on
judgment because it's

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.850 align:middle line:90%
such a pervasive issue.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:40.430 align:middle line:84%
When we're jealous of someone,
often what we're jealous of

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:44.390 align:middle line:84%
is what we see in someone else
is really a part of ourselves

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.550 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't developed yet.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.090 align:middle line:90%
So we're not necessarily--

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:53.750 align:middle line:84%
we project out onto them our
own feelings of disappointment

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't allowed
ourselves to truly develop

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.130 align:middle line:90%
those parts of ourselves yet.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
the other person ever.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.820 align:middle line:84%
The other person is merely a
mirror reflecting back to you

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.800 align:middle line:84%
the disowned parts
of your shadow.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.072 align:middle line:84%
So if you're truly
on a spiritual path,

00:43:09.072 --> 00:43:10.280 align:middle line:90%
you'll look at that jealousy.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.400 align:middle line:90%
You'll witness that judgment.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.192 align:middle line:84%
You'll ask yourself,
what is the wound that

00:43:13.192 --> 00:43:14.990 align:middle line:84%
lives beneath this
judgment and how can I

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.130 align:middle line:84%
begin the journey of
healing that wound?

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's many, many
steps that we can take.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I've written an entire
book on the topic.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And there's
practices that we can

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.440 align:middle line:84%
take to begin to heal
those perceptions.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Because anyone that's
chosen the spiritual path,

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I know they want to feel good.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that's watching
this film right now,

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:35.960 align:middle line:90%
they want to feel good.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.040 align:middle line:90%
You want to feel good.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what they want.

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:43.550 align:middle line:90%
So be willing to see your part.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Be willing to see how
what you're projecting out

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:50.200 align:middle line:84%
is something that you
don't want to feel.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.472 align:middle line:90%
That's big.

00:43:51.472 --> 00:43:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Big.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.940 align:middle line:84%
With the "Judgment Detox," I
mean, why did you write it?

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And why was it an
important piece

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:90%
of work for you at this time?

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I wrote a book called
"The Universe Has Your Back,"

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and there was a chapter in that
book about how we have to heal

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:10.070 align:middle line:84%
our judgment to get closer to
our connection to the universe.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I finished
writing that chapter,

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I put my hands down on the
keyboard and I was like, oh,

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.040 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.858 align:middle line:90%
This is a book.

00:44:15.858 --> 00:44:18.150 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And I wasn't even
done writing the other book.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:19.983 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I had
a book in front of me.

00:44:19.983 --> 00:44:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So right away, I started
writing that book.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote it right in the
middle of the 2016 election

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.525 align:middle line:84%
when judgment was just
at an all-time high.

00:44:29.525 --> 00:44:31.650 align:middle line:84%
There was so much division,
not just in my country,

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:33.610 align:middle line:90%
but all throughout the world.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:36.690 align:middle line:84%
It became really clear to
me that not only politically

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.680 align:middle line:84%
where we divided, but even
just daily on our social media

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:90%
feed we were creating division.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.058 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this
wasn't just an issue

00:44:45.058 --> 00:44:47.100 align:middle line:84%
that I had to show up for
because I was seeing it

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:47.900 align:middle line:90%
all around me.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was something I
had to show up for myself.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Because my own judgments
were getting the best of me.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:54.935 align:middle line:84%
My own judgments were
keeping me separate.

00:44:54.935 --> 00:44:56.310 align:middle line:84%
They were keeping
me disconnected

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.890 align:middle line:84%
from a God of my
own understanding.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.267 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to heal
that separation.

00:45:01.267 --> 00:45:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So I often write my
books because I've

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:04.310 align:middle line:90%
got something to heal.

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result of
writing this six-step process

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.290 align:middle line:84%
of reframing your judgment
and releasing the beliefs that

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:14.820 align:middle line:84%
are holding you back, I healed
in the most miraculous ways

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and the most incredible ways.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I have such a different
experience of judgment now.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.690 align:middle line:84%
When I feel judged,
my reaction now

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:24.270 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily-- of course
to pray for the person who's

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.010 align:middle line:84%
judging me, but my
immediate reactions

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.720 align:middle line:84%
when I feel judged
by someone else

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.450 align:middle line:84%
is to instantly do
something kind to make

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.890 align:middle line:90%
somebody else feel good.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:35.430 align:middle line:84%
That is my knee-jerk reaction,
as a result of taking myself

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:37.500 align:middle line:84%
through these steps is
that I no longer have

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.160 align:middle line:84%
tolerance for even engaging
in the experience of feeling

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:42.960 align:middle line:90%
judged.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.290 align:middle line:84%
When I witness myself judging,
I catch myself immediately,

00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:48.060 align:middle line:84%
and I take myself
through the steps.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.990 align:middle line:84%
I can unwind that
judgment within moments.

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And my comeback
rate is incredible.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I've made a
commitment to dissolve

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.830 align:middle line:90%
those boundaries with love.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:01.630 align:middle line:84%
So the steps in the
book are very crucial.

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:03.920 align:middle line:84%
We have to witness our
judgment without judgment.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have to
honor the wounds that

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:07.080 align:middle line:90%
live beneath the judgment.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And we can use things like
emotional freedom technique

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.450 align:middle line:84%
and different practices to heal
those core wounds that we've

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.400 align:middle line:84%
talked about a
lot here, and then

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.600 align:middle line:84%
begin to pray to
offer up, to put love

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.980 align:middle line:90%
on the altar as the third step.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:84%
To offer up that desire
to change through prayer.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.057 align:middle line:84%
And then to see
for the first time

00:46:25.057 --> 00:46:26.640 align:middle line:84%
is the fourth step,
which is beginning

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to look at the people who
we've held grievances toward

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and, instead of focusing
on those grievances,

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:33.810 align:middle line:90%
focus on their light.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.912 align:middle line:84%
So choose to see what is
magnificent about them.

00:46:36.912 --> 00:46:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Choose to see the grace that
they bring to the world.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Choose to see them in the
light of who they are.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And even if we can't because
it's someone that's hurt us

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and harmed us so
deeply, we can see them

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
as the great opportunity
for our spiritual awakening.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.495 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a whole step
by meditating for oneness,

00:46:53.495 --> 00:46:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and then the final
step, which is

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:84%
bringing your shadows to the
light through forgiveness.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So these are
cumulative practices

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.760 align:middle line:84%
that build upon the next to
get the reader to a place

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.880 align:middle line:84%
where they can really undo
the behavior of judgment.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.427 align:middle line:90%
And it's an addictive pattern.

00:47:08.427 --> 00:47:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Like any addiction, you have to
replace it with a new pattern,

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:12.090 align:middle line:90%
as I said before.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.243 align:middle line:84%
So we take our judgment, and
we do something else instead.

00:47:16.243 --> 00:47:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And we witness our judgment,
we do something else instead.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do that,
the more you get to a place

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.470 align:middle line:84%
where you are no longer
tolerant of that craziness.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:28.520 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
it always comes up.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, [INAUDIBLE]
godfather, who's

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:36.230 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual mentor in my
life talked about how we tend

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:39.230 align:middle line:84%
to have this belief system
that we're separate,

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.912 align:middle line:90%
that we're not connected.

00:47:40.912 --> 00:47:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's become
pervasive in our culture.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.037 align:middle line:84%
It's become pervasive in our
politics, like you mentioned.

00:47:45.037 --> 00:47:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It's become pervasive in, I
like this music, not this--

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.970 align:middle line:84%
every area of our culture,
we create division,

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and in race as well.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's not a truth that--

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not a spiritual
truth, I don't believe.

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
lessons he got given

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:08.330 align:middle line:84%
was, when you see
separation, laugh at it,

00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:09.365 align:middle line:90%
because it's not true.

00:48:09.365 --> 00:48:10.165 align:middle line:90%
It's a facade.

00:48:10.165 --> 00:48:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And I really try to catch
myself whenever I see division.

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So in a sort of
finishing statement here,

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.670 align:middle line:84%
could you explain that
this sort of dilemma

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that we have with
separation in this world,

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.288 align:middle line:84%
all the different
areas where there

00:48:26.288 --> 00:48:29.270 align:middle line:84%
are separation, how that is not
a spiritual truth by aligning

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:32.250 align:middle line:84%
with the oneness and
with that connection,

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.450 align:middle line:84%
we can start to heal ourselves,
the world, the planet,

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.250 align:middle line:84%
realign ourselves,
feel more fulfilled,

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:40.070 align:middle line:84%
and feel more connected and
feel that sense of love that's

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:44.350 align:middle line:84%
ever present and not forsaken
or taken away from us.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So we all have
the same problem,

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and we all have
the same solution.

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is we
separated from God.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.290 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And the solution is to realign
with God and to remember love.

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So we separated from love
when we started to build up

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.360 align:middle line:84%
the belief systems of the world
when we started to believe in

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.370 align:middle line:84%
less than, or on the
playground, and things happen.

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:12.200 align:middle line:84%
We see that I'm different or
whatever those stories are,

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.200 align:middle line:84%
as we're children, and
we believe those stories,

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and we replay them
and repurpose them.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's in any given
moment, an opportunity

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.870 align:middle line:84%
to do exactly what you said is
to laugh at the tiny met ideas,

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:26.840 align:middle line:84%
to laugh at the judgment,
to laugh at the separation,

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and even really be the
witness of the havoc

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.480 align:middle line:90%
that it plays in your life.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's like any belief system--

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:39.720 align:middle line:84%
separation is the greatest
belief system we have to undo,

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.000 align:middle line:84%
and it's at the root of
all these other problems,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.520 align:middle line:84%
the feelings of not being good
enough, the feelings of fear,

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.853 align:middle line:84%
the feelings of inadequacy,
the feelings of being better

00:49:46.853 --> 00:49:48.210 align:middle line:90%
than or less than.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:50.560 align:middle line:84%
At the root of all
that is separation.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.100 align:middle line:90%
And so through any type of--

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.840 align:middle line:90%
any spiritual path--

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have many
that I follow--

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.010 align:middle line:84%
any type of spiritual
path, really, truly,

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:01.950 align:middle line:84%
your own inner wisdom,
developing that,

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that belief system and
that inner guidance system

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:09.030 align:middle line:84%
will begin to get you on a
journey and a path of undoing

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.600 align:middle line:84%
the belief system of separation
and remembering the belief

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.920 align:middle line:90%
system of oneness.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So my advice to
anyone listening,

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:19.050 align:middle line:84%
if they feel separate
and alone, and they

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:23.580 align:middle line:84%
feel under attack or attacking,
that the work we have to do

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.210 align:middle line:84%
is to get into a daily
practice of realigning

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.070 align:middle line:90%
with the belief system of love.

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And that will come
in many forms,

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and I pray for everyone
watching to find

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.610 align:middle line:84%
the teachers, and the
healers, and the prayers,

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and the meditations,
and the practices that

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:41.100 align:middle line:84%
will be their guide to
bring their thoughts

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and bridge their thoughts
from this world of separation

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:46.650 align:middle line:84%
and fear back to a
world of love and light.

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I said earlier,
the light never left us;

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:54.165 align:middle line:90%
we just forgot to look at it.

00:50:54.165 --> 00:50:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.990 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:58.010 align:middle line:90%
That's such a great way to wrap.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Final thought.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:04.832 align:middle line:84%
Is there any quotes or
lessons [INAUDIBLE] of course

00:51:04.832 --> 00:51:06.740 align:middle line:84%
a miracle's a lot,
that really stand out

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:10.430 align:middle line:84%
for you as being important for
people on this path, that you

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.740 align:middle line:84%
hold as your most
important quote,

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that you draw a lot of faith on,
that you want to share with us?

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> A beautiful quote is that the
secret to prayer is to forget

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:21.560 align:middle line:90%
what we think we need.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we get so hooked
into, I need this thing,

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:27.980 align:middle line:84%
or I want it on
my time, or I have

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to have this to
feel good enough.

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:34.370 align:middle line:84%
But when we forget what we think
we need and we offer it up,

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:35.980 align:middle line:90%
then we can truly receive.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:37.410 align:middle line:84%
That's when we can
really receive.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:41.060 align:middle line:90%
