00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:09.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.620 align:middle line:10%
And today, I have a very
special guest with me.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.930 align:middle line:10%
We have been friends
for a number of years

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.640 align:middle line:10%
since we met at the
first time sharing

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:10%
a stage at an event in Mexico.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Philip is a
motivational speaker.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.100 align:middle line:90%
He is an author.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:90%
He is a filmmaker.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And he helps you to excavate
the light in your life

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and take that to
the world and make

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:84%
sense of some of
the dark spaces that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.698 align:middle line:84%
may reside in your energetic
body, in your story.

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And he does this through
many different concepts,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.375 align:middle line:84%
one of which is
called One Last Talk.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:41.750 align:middle line:84%
It is a book, but
it is a concept

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
where he helps you understand
your personal story so that you

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
can project out where you
might go and understand more

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
about how you can
achieve a deeper

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.960 align:middle line:84%
sense of peace, happiness,
and fulfillment in your life.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Philip.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:90%
How did I go?

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Was that a good intro?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you're in a unique
line of work in that you are

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.780 align:middle line:84%
experimenting with the work
yourself and using people

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
to experiment on
their own lives,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and using life as an opportunity
to discover more of the gifts

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:90%
that people have.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I see that in
your work, you're

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:90%
constantly seeking to evolve.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But one of the first areas
that I want to speak about

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit about the
cultural sort of environment

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
that we've found
ourselves in the midst

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:90%
of in this particular time.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
We have developed what
we sort of call in some

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
circles an acronym,
a weird culture,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:84%
a Western-educated,
industrialized, rich and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:90%
democratic world.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I think I got the spacing right.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And that has created
an environment

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:84%
where we've seemed to place
material possessions and wealth

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
accumulation above
family, above friends,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
and we've isolated ourselves
in our wealthy houses up

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:90%
on the hill.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You've worked with many of
these people at great cost.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.440 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
some of the biggest

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:84%
downfalls of this system are
in terms of people's happiness,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:90%
health, and well-being?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of the
social constructs that have

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:90%
historically been around--

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.213 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if I
think about Ireland,

00:02:19.213 --> 00:02:22.320 align:middle line:84%
a small island
where I grew up, we

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:90%
put bank managers on pedestals.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:84%
We put financial
institutions on pedestals.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:90%
We were fearful of them.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.050 align:middle line:84%
We gave them way
too much respect.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
the early '70s,

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
if you walk down the
pathway or the sidewalk

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and a priest came towards you,
you would step off the pavement

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:90%
and allow the priest to pass.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And as the banking
system has been shaken

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and as people have taken
the bank managers literally

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
off pedestals, as Catholicism
in Ireland has been shaken

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and people are choosing, for
example, not to go to church,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:84%
it's leaving some
sort of vacuum.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's leaving people
isolated to some extent

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and searching for
community on Facebook.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And yes, Facebook groups
and Facebook communities,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:90%
some of them are very good.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they're no
more than a Facebook group.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And people are moving
into these places

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
online, looking for
a village of people,

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
looking for a community,
and not necessarily feeling

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.370 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual connective
tissues that they want

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:90%
or connectivity that they want.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they're left
looking in the mirror going,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.150 align:middle line:90%
the community's not the problem.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm the problem.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm the issue here.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that we're in
a world right now where

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
the greatest pandemic is
isolation and loneliness.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can have 5,000 Facebook
friends, 25,000 Twitter

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
followers, and yet feel very
lonely within your own skin.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.535 align:middle line:10%
And I feel that that is one
of the biggest things that

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:56.233 align:middle line:10%
is haunting humanity.

00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:57.775 align:middle line:84%
And what a lot of
people are doing is

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:00.100 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to replace
that with achievement,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%
and it simply is not working.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> An interesting point you
raise is about social media.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have given away a lot
of our self-worth and our value

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.590 align:middle line:90%
to social media.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And people will look
to likes and views

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:90%
as a sense of self-worth.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is leading the world
in quite a tricky predicament

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.310 align:middle line:84%
in that the younger generation,
or even this current generation

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.828 align:middle line:84%
that's alive now
are externalizing

00:04:27.828 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
their self-worth as opposed to
building that from the inside.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Is that something you'd say
you've witnessed in your work?

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.173 align:middle line:90%
>> I see it all the time.

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:90%
I see it all the time.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for that
external recognition.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working with
clients every single day

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that have climbed that
mountain, the mountain

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.545 align:middle line:84%
of societal success,
financial success.

00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And they've climbed
the mountain.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:90%
They get to the top.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.133 align:middle line:84%
They look around, and they just
feel-- they feel an emptiness.

00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:51.232 align:middle line:84%
And as you and I have discussed
before, rather than stopping

00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and saying, what are I
missing, what am I not seeing,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
what is the question
I'm avoiding,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
what is the part of me that
I'm afraid the world will

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
see, we just come
down off the mountain,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:84%
climb another mountain,
and keep repeating

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
the same internal pattern
and getting exactly

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
the same result. All
the time I see it.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:90%
I see it every single day.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say that the
way that we've been taught

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
to parent in the West could
be contributing to that?

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've spoken
to people who

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.730 align:middle line:84%
have built a business, made huge
amounts of monetary success,

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.007 align:middle line:84%
pleased their parents to
no end, and then realized

00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
they were only doing
it because that's

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:90%
how they were loved as a child.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:84%
They were loved when
they were successful.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
They were loved when
they got good grades.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.595 align:middle line:84%
And they translated
that to, well, I'll

00:05:33.595 --> 00:05:36.215 align:middle line:90%
be loved when I'm wealthy.

00:05:36.215 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And then when they realize
they've been doing that,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.923 align:middle line:84%
it just brings their
whole world down.

00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, whoa.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Who am I to be now?

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Is that the sort of thing
you're talking about?

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's spoken
expectations from our parents,

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
but I think where I
tend to focus a lot on

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:90%
is the unspoken expectations.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the little
analogy or story that I use

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:84%
is, you know, the father comes
down to the kitchen table,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and Johnny's about
to go to school

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and choose whatever college
he's about to go after.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And his father has
verbalized how much

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.502 align:middle line:84%
he disdains parents that put
their kids under pressure.

00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And he turns to Johnny.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
He says, Johnny,
you can do whatever

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
you want with your
life, and Mom and myself

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:90%
will be so proud of you.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Now I was a postman and your
grandfather was a postman,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.898 align:middle line:84%
but you go do whatever
you want to do.

00:06:22.898 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And he goes to the golf course
and he tells his buddies

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:90%
that he just had a chat.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But Johnny goes to
school that day,

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
wishing and praying and
dreaming about being a pilot.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But actually, he yearns
the love of his father

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and the approval of his father,
and he's haunted by the fact

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that his father has
gifted him this idea

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that really if you want me
to love you and accept you

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
beyond measure, you
should be a postman.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't say that.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's the unspoken expectations.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you delve into
that, when you are parented,

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.580 align:middle line:84%
it can show you a lot of
what drives you today,

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and it can really help you
understand your narrative.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.513 align:middle line:90%
And it's not right or wrong.

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It just is what it is.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But it allows you then to pivot
a little bit sooner in life

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:84%
rather than waiting till you're
90 years old to discover it.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This sort of plays into that
idea that we are meaning making

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:90%
machines, right?

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.777 align:middle line:84%
We tend to place and create
meaning out of experiences.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example
of someone who created

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.693 align:middle line:90%
meaning out of experience.

00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:29.030 align:middle line:84%
My dad said do
this, but deep down,

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
what I understood
to be true is that I

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
should be a postman if I want
to follow my dad's role in life.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:84%
As parents or as
children, how can we

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:84%
be more aware of
those sort of meanings

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:90%
we're placing on situations?

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's something
I struggle with.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.077 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I struggle
with a lot of things.

00:07:47.077 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But the thing I struggle
with most is parenting.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.068 align:middle line:90%
It's just a constant.

00:07:51.068 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And just when you think you're
just achieving something

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
very effectively, it just
comes back to bite you.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that I
have found to work truly

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:84%
as a parent is honestly
allowing my kids to see

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
my vulnerabilities,
is to truthfully share

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.840 align:middle line:84%
where my fears lie
when I come back

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.910 align:middle line:84%
after a keynote or workshop
that didn't go well

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.490 align:middle line:84%
is to sit down and talk my
kids, if they're interested.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And recently, we had
an example of this

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.938 align:middle line:84%
where my little girl with a
few the neighbors-- they're all

00:08:18.938 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:84%
eight years old--
decided that they'd

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:90%
fill the mailboxes with rocks.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And they did two or three, and
then my little girl felt guilty

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle line:90%
and she came home.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said to her brother,
Charlie, who's my son who's 10,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:90%
she said, listen.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I did this, and I
feel really bad.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And just about two weeks
earlier, I basically

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.742 align:middle line:84%
had this conversation
with my kids

00:08:37.742 --> 00:08:39.159 align:middle line:84%
where I shared
stuff that I'd done

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not very proud of.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.583 align:middle line:90%
And my wife was like, oh my god.

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
you're sharing this.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:90%
And the kids were mesmerized.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.358 align:middle line:84%
They just couldn't believe that
Dad was sharing all this stuff

00:08:47.358 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that he'd done that
he's not proud of

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:90%
and that was bad or bold.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And Charlie turns to Maggie
in the moment of guilt

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
that she was feeling about
filling the mailboxes of rocks,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:84%
which is not a very serious
thing when you think about it,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.020 align:middle line:90%
and says, you should tell Dad.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:00.980 align:middle line:90%
She goes, Dad?

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
He's the one guy I'm
not going to tell.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.792 align:middle line:84%
And Charlie goes back and
says, you should tell Dad.

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Remember a couple of weeks
ago, the stuff he told us?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.415 align:middle line:90%
He's done way worse.

00:09:10.415 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And the two kids came
to me and they sat down

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and they explained
what had happened,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and we just had a chat about it.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And I find that a lot
of parents is we're

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:90%
trying to protect our kids.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
it in a physical sense,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:84%
we put cotton wool
around all the corners

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.117 align:middle line:84%
of all the chairs
and everything else,

00:09:27.117 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to overprotect
our kids by not allowing

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.890 align:middle line:90%
our kids to see our weaknesses.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.350 align:middle line:84%
We play sports that we're
good at with our children

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
rather than playing a sport
that we can't play for crap,

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and allowing our kids to see
that Dad is miserable at soccer

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:90%
or miserable at tennis.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that we're actually
not protecting our kids at all.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.463 align:middle line:84%
We're just simply trying
to protect ourselves.

00:09:47.463 --> 00:09:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to protect
ourselves emotionally.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.047 align:middle line:84%
We justify it through
the lens of, well,

00:09:51.047 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing the best
for my children.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And then our kids are
brought up in an environment

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
where they think their
parents are flawless.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:90%
They're superheroes.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.323 align:middle line:10%
And they go on to emulate
those parents, which

00:10:03.323 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:10%
of course is a catastrophe,
because it's never

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.790 align:middle line:10%
going to work.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the concepts I heard
you speak about in an interview

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:84%
that I looked at or
listened to, should I say,

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
was this idea of somebody
who was in a midlife crisis.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
They're working a job for
the last 15 or 20 years

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.730 align:middle line:90%
that they hated.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And they hadn't built up
the strength or courage

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
to leave or do something that
really followed their passion.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And the excuse that he was
using in this particular example

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that he gave was that he was
just doing it for his kids,

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.548 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that they
could have enough money,

00:10:39.548 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
to make sure they
could be secure.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, when I heard
you telling this story,

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I could see that the example
he was setting for his children

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:90%
was that, play it safe.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.340 align:middle line:90%
Do something you don't love.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:90%
Play within the rulebook.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, he was causing
two catastrophes, right?

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we do
this to our children,

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and do you have any
examples of this?

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I remember that
correctly, it wasn't until I

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.860 align:middle line:84%
said, you know, give me the
name of one of your children--

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and let's just say
his child was John.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if John was
sitting where you are,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:84%
describing how painful
it is to go to a job

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
every single day for, I
believe, 14 years in a row where

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:84%
your soul has been diluted
every single moment

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.012 align:middle line:84%
of every single day and he was
saying exactly what you were

00:11:31.012 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:84%
saying, and you
were standing here,

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:90%
what would you say to him?

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.607 align:middle line:90%
And he said, leave.

00:11:35.607 --> 00:11:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Don't waste another day
of your life, buddy.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
You've got so much
more potential.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't until I used--

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's not the right
terminology-- his child for him

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:84%
to understand what he
was inadvertently doing.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.720 align:middle line:10%
And he just-- he
couldn't see it.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:90%
He just couldn't see it.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.150 align:middle line:84%
He was using his children
as a reason or a rationale

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.103 align:middle line:84%
to stay doing something
that he was doing.

00:12:03.103 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But in the end of the
day-- and I can tell you

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.197 align:middle line:84%
this for absolute certainty--
amongst other things,

00:12:08.197 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:84%
the reason he stays is
not for his children.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The reason he stays
is not to put his kids

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.160 align:middle line:90%
to a private school.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.285 align:middle line:84%
And the reason he stays is
not to pay the mortgage.

00:12:14.285 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:84%
The reason he
stays is he doesn't

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:84%
value himself enough to believe
that he deserves anything

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
more than a job that is killing
his soul every single day.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And he deprives his children and
humanity of his greatest gifts

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
by staying in a job
that just crushes

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:90%
his soul every single day.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And what ends up happening is
that is not a conversation that

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:90%
can exist in the future.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.290 align:middle line:90%
That becomes a lecture.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when dad says to his
young son, don't do that,

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.430 align:middle line:84%
don't stay in a job, and
he's done it his entire life,

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.390 align:middle line:84%
his son is either internally
or externally going, yeah, Dad.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:90%
OK, Dad.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Are we finished?

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Can I get back to
whatever I'm doing?

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
But if he's an example of
that, a shining example where

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.600 align:middle line:84%
he takes the risk, puts a value
on his own skin, and says,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I am worth more than this,
that conversation won't even

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:90%
need to happen.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And if it does, his son will
be there, listening intently,

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:84%
because his father's an
example of everything

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:90%
that he's discussing.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the main parts of your
work now is around this concept

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:90%
called One Last Talk.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And I know there's going
to be some stories we're

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
going to hear around
this, but before we

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:84%
go into any personal
stories that you've shared

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
or on some topics that
I might ask you about,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
what is the concept behind this,
and how did you sort of come up

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:90%
with this line of work?

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.173 align:middle line:90%
Because it's quite unique.

00:13:34.173 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else is doing this.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.797 align:middle line:84%
And how did you
come up with this?

00:13:36.797 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to change
the conversation.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to challenge
the event space

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
where the majority
of live events

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:84%
are the audience are
sitting in the seats, one

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
guru or specialist or
expert after another gets up

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
there and shares
their success story,

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some
beautiful value as well.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:90%
How I made it, how I did this.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And often, there's
this undertone

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:90%
where people don't discuss it.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:84%
As people are leaving, not
feeling motivated or inspired,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
they're feeling a
little bit inadequate.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And I use Richard Branson,
and I say that respectfully,

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
because Richard's done some
wonderful things in the world.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.173 align:middle line:84%
But the relatability
was the next thing

00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:15.090 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to challenge.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.715 align:middle line:84%
How many people can
sit in an audience,

00:14:16.715 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
relate to Richard,
when at his peak

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:90%
he had 85,000 staff or a team.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.845 align:middle line:84%
He had his airline,
and so on and so forth.

00:14:24.845 --> 00:14:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And internally-- and I've
interviewed enough people

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
to know this for fact-- is they
go, yeah, but I can't do that.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.800 align:middle line:90%
He's Richard Branson.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
create a platform

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:84%
where the people on the
stage are the audience,

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and that there is no gurus.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:90%
There is no VIP tickets.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to prove to
humanity not just does everyone

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:84%
have a beautiful,
personal story,

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:90%
but that that story matters.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.522 align:middle line:84%
And when they're
courageous enough

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
to share a part of
them that perhaps they

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:90%
don't want the world to know--

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:84%
they share a part of
that they're ashamed of,

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.690 align:middle line:84%
they share a part of themselves
that they're embarrassed by--

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.000 align:middle line:84%
they free themselves
of that story.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
They heal themselves
of that trauma.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, inadvertently, they
invite the rest of the world

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:84%
to be healed also,
because somebody

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the globe
listens to a One Last Talk,

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:84%
watches a One Last
Talk, and goes, oh my.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm not alone.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And if he can talk
about his story,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
if she can share her story,
maybe I can share mine.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is when healing
happens, connection grows.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And when connection is there,
it prevents the possibility

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:90%
of isolation and loneliness.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.836 align:middle line:84%
And that's why One
Last Talk exists.

00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Marshall Rosenberg--
I'm not sure

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.812 align:middle line:84%
if you're familiar with
his work-- he wrote

00:15:45.812 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:84%
a really seminal piece
of work on communication

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:90%
called Nonviolent Communication.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.703 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
concepts he talks about

00:15:51.703 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
is understanding somebody's
need or understanding somebody's

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.975 align:middle line:90%
pain and empathizing with it.

00:15:58.975 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Not solving it, not fixing
it, not creating a solution

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
or saying, I know a
therapist or I know this.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Just hearing it,
just understanding it

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.653 align:middle line:84%
is healing, and can be
the healing process.

00:16:12.653 --> 00:16:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that you subscribe to?

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Is that something you've seen?

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember this so clearly.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
We ran a One Last
Talk in Boulder.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.473 align:middle line:84%
And this man called
in a month beforehand.

00:16:24.473 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:90%
He's a client of mine.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, my son Matthew
is having some challenges.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd love him to come
to One Last Talk.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:90%
How do I get him there?

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, tell me.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
What are you thinking
of saying or doing?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I'm going to
sit him down and give him all

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.808 align:middle line:90%
the reasons why he should go.

00:16:40.808 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said, how does that work?

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, what do you mean?

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how did
that work for you,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.243 align:middle line:90%
when your father did that?

00:16:46.243 --> 00:16:47.646 align:middle line:90%
He goes, it didn't.

00:16:47.646 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I said, what if you just sat
down and said, I love you,

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm scared of losing you, I
don't know what's going on.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Let me understand you
so I can support you

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.440 align:middle line:84%
or get the hell out
of your own way,

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.607 align:middle line:90%
or the hell out of your way.

00:17:00.607 --> 00:17:02.625 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And his son said, I'll
think about it when he said,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:90%
would you come to One Last Talk?

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And a month later, they
arrived in Boulder,

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.543 align:middle line:90%
and his son was 15 years old.

00:17:11.543 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the event-- he's

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
not a hugging kid,
according to his father,

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the event,
his father comes up,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and this young Matthew appears
behind him and comes straight

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
up and just launches himself
into my chest and embraces me.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:90%
And I hold him.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
I look behind, and his
father starts to cry.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And as we pull apart
from our embrace,

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
a question I rarely
ask anybody, I

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:84%
said, what's your number
one takeaway from today

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
after watching six
speakers, one after another,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
share their one last talk?

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's great to know
that adults have problems too.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
It's great to know that
adults have problems too.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot of
parents make their job,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:84%
their mortgage payment,
their investment portfolio

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:84%
so massive, so significant--
talk about meaning--

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that a child who's struggling
to connect in the playground

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have the
space, the significance

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to come to Dad or Mom
with the biggest challenge

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
that they are facing in
their lives right now,

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.985 align:middle line:84%
and to feel that they
can air that and that it

00:18:16.985 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
has significance and
meaning, and that they're OK,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and they're valued
enough in that unit

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do that.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, the
father realized that he just

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:90%
doesn't listen to his son.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.960 align:middle line:84%
He's too busy telling him
what he should and should not

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
be doing with his life, which
is exactly what his father did

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.070 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.310 align:middle line:90%
And so it continues.

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:39.360 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> To bring yourself to
a level of awareness that

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
you're repeating the patterns
that your parents did

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's become something that
you're subconsciously now doing

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:84%
with your children, how do
people come to that awareness

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:90%
point?

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.417 align:middle line:84%
How have you seen them come
to that awareness point?

00:18:55.417 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll give you one,
and it's a bit of a fun thing,

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
but it's real, is
I often ask people,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
which of your parents
are you most like?

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And I often get reactions like,
well, I can tell you one thing.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm definitely not my dad.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm definitely not my father.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Good luck with that one.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
That's most likely who you
are almost identical to.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you try
to move away from that,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
the more you're
emulating your father.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
It's about recognizing
that actually, you're

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:90%
very similar to your father.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:84%
It's about integrating
and allowing yourself

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
to feel that you're almost
identical in so many ways,

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:90%
and also unique in many ways.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
It's about accepting that and
then choosing a different path.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So many parents today
are trying to make

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
sure that their kids don't get
what they got, or they have

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:90%
what they didn't have.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And the polar opposite of
that, the other extreme

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
is that they just continue
to repeat history.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of parents go,
yeah, well, my dad did this,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:90%
and I probably have--

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:90%
my kids don't get that.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:84%
My natural assumption,
James, all the time

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is, I'm passing shit onto my
kids that doesn't serve them.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:90%
That's my natural assumption.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And if I can assume that, that
opens doorways and awareness

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and opportunities for me to
see little subtleties of things

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.520 align:middle line:84%
that I say, if I have to
stop this car-- and I go,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:90%
oh, my good god.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:90%
That was my dad.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:84%
9,000 times a day, it
felt like he said it.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And I go, I'm catching that.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm in denial of that
reality, if I say to myself,

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
no, I'm more aware of
that, my kids don't--

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.735 align:middle line:84%
it's just to assume
every day that you're

00:20:31.735 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
passing on shit to your kids
that is not going to serve--

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:90%
that didn't serve you.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.443 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do.

00:20:37.443 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But don't try to create
this chasm between you

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and the dysfunctionality
you saw in your parents.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Come closer to it
and see the fact

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
that it's already
there inside of you,

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:90%
and then you can work with it.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Now you have something
to work with.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:90%
It's like clay.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:84%
You can maneuver it and
manipulate it and then

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:84%
create something
beautiful out of it.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's painful
as shit, right?

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Because that might be a
subtle thing, like, OK.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling my kids, be quiet.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Don't make me stop the car.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's a subtlety that's
important to be aware of,

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and if you are aware
of that, you're

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
able to course correct
and say, hang on.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.240 align:middle line:84%
How can I give my children
the microphone for a minute

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:84%
so they can feel
heard and understood?

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's fixable.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.220 align:middle line:90%
What if you were abused?

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:84%
What if you were
physically abused?

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:84%
What if you were
sexually abused?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.723 align:middle line:84%
Leaning into that
is not an exercise

00:21:28.723 --> 00:21:29.890 align:middle line:90%
that most people want to do.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they spend most of
their life trying to hide that.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.570 align:middle line:84%
The energy that's expelled
trying to hide that stuff

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:90%
is astonishing.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I use to
describe that is they're

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:90%
so used to hiding it.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
The amount of energy it
takes to hide and suppress

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
any type of trauma
is staggering.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're living with
it every single day

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.360 align:middle line:90%
that we don't even know.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I
describe this is my mother

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.795 align:middle line:84%
suffers from significant
arthritis and pain every day.

00:22:03.795 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And I often ask her,
how are you doing today?

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:06.503 align:middle line:90%
And she'd go, great.

00:22:06.503 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Today is a good day.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And if I could get a probe
that could go into my hip--

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and could go into her hip
and I could experience

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:84%
for two seconds, five seconds
what she's experiencing

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
in terms of pain,
I'd land on the floor

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:84%
like a bag of potatoes, and I'd
roll around probably in agony.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
But she's been living with
that pain for so long.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.807 align:middle line:84%
She's been living with
that pain for so long,

00:22:26.807 --> 00:22:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and she's been numbing
it for so long,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:32.440 align:middle line:84%
she has no idea of
the energetic cost.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the cost,
the short-term discomfort,

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.530 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it that,
of addressing a trauma such

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
as sexual abuse, physical
abuse, mental abuse that you

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:84%
experienced as a child,
the short-term discomfort--

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.450 align:middle line:84%
it's the tip of the iceberg
when it comes to living

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:90%
with that every single day.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Because again, your
soul is depressed.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Your spirit is squashed.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:90%
You don't get to amplify.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:90%
You don't get to show up.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to share
all of who you are.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you think for a moment
that by me hiding my trauma,

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
by me not talking about it
I'm protecting everybody else,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:90%
you're living in a cloud.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
You're living on Mars, because
your kids are feeling it

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:90%
energetically every single day.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not sitting
there going, why

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is Mom not as alive as
my friend Albert's mom?

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Where's the spark in her face?

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
My mother-- and I've
never shared this before--

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:90%
but my mother was--

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
my mother was sexually abused
by a priest in Ireland.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And I always knew there
was something there.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I always knew there
was something there.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.032 align:middle line:84%
She's so beautiful,
so intuitive.

00:23:47.032 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:90%
But I always knew there was--

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I always wondered, why
does she not trust herself?

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Why is that intuition
that she has in

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.690 align:middle line:84%
abundance that if I do have and
she gifted to me, why isn't she

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:90%
trusted?

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I say this with
love and respect.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
My mother doesn't like who
she is, and therefore allows

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.818 align:middle line:84%
herself, her body
to deteriorate.

00:24:05.818 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And she's never addressed
that in her life.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.473 align:middle line:90%
And that is her choice.

00:24:09.473 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:84%
But as a child growing
up in that environment,

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.920 align:middle line:90%
I knew there was something off.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But it was never spoken about
until one day I turned to her.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.223 align:middle line:84%
I said, Mom, what do
I not know about you?

00:24:19.223 --> 00:24:20.390 align:middle line:90%
What are you not telling me?

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:84%
By holding on to trauma,
you're passing it

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
on to the next generation
energetically, spiritually.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And I know you think you're
doing a good job suppressing

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:90%
it, but you're not.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.188 align:middle line:84%
You're doing a shitty
job suppressing it,

00:24:36.188 --> 00:24:37.990 align:middle line:84%
because it's taking
way too much energy,

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.737 align:middle line:84%
and that energy could be
expelled in so many other ways.

00:24:41.737 --> 00:24:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Because when you hide
your negative emotion,

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.940 align:middle line:84%
you high trauma, you hide
your gift in there with it.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.890 align:middle line:84%
You put it in a box
and lock it away.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I believe our greatest gift
lies right next to our deepest

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:90%
wounds.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.878 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
believe to my core.

00:24:55.878 --> 00:24:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So people listening to this
right now may have experienced

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:90%
trauma in their life.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.222 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they've being abused.

00:25:01.222 --> 00:25:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've been
sexually abused.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've been
verbally abused or told

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.730 align:middle line:84%
that they're not good
enough or bullied,

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.660 align:middle line:90%
and they've held onto that.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:90%
What can they do?

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.232 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.232 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> They need to unpack it.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:90%
They need to verbalize it.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in my opinion
more valuable, more healing--

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.985 align:middle line:84%
not downloading your story,
but sharing your story.

00:25:31.985 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Sharing it with
people you trust,

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:90%
sharing it with strangers.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
At the very least,
going to therapy.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first
time I went to therapy,

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.280 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't need therapy.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.572 align:middle line:90%
I was way too cool for therapy.

00:25:45.572 --> 00:25:47.197 align:middle line:84%
I was going because
I was just curious.

00:25:47.197 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And I went to see
this guy and I said,

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.165 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to see how you work.

00:25:51.165 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:90%
And I walked into the room.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure I've shared
this story with you, James.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But I walked into the room,
and there was two chairs.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And one had the
biggest box of Kleenex

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.933 align:middle line:90%
I've ever seen in my life.

00:26:00.933 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It looked like must have
been a wholesale box,

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:90%
like a stack of them.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.065 align:middle line:90%
And I sat in the other chair.

00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:90%
And the guy walks in.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:09.660 align:middle line:90%
He goes, sorry.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:10.440 align:middle line:90%
That's my chair.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:90%
And I sat down.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.562 align:middle line:84%
It was like a "Jerry
Maguire" moment.

00:26:12.562 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And I look at the Kleenex and
I'm thinking to myself, pfft.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Not a chance, buddy.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Crying?

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Me?

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd say two and a
half minutes in,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I was vibrating and oscillating
between complete sadness

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:84%
that I've never experience in
my life before and absolute rage

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and anger towards
myself and the world.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.310 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:90%
I was stunned.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I was frightened.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I believed that
I didn't need the help.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I believed there wasn't
even a story to impact.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And if there was, it's
not that significant.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And over that period
of time I realized

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the burden I was carrying,
the heaviness I was carrying.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And everything in my
life was representative

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.943 align:middle line:90%
of what was going on.

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't giving myself
permission to feel love

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and to experience
love and to give love.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't giving myself
permission to even imagine

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:84%
what it would be like to have
a good job that I enjoyed,

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.440 align:middle line:84%
or start a business, or do
a speech, or write a book,

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.450 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
contracted and closed.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And week by week, month
by month, day by day,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.870 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want
to call it, I just

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.660 align:middle line:84%
started letting go of more
and more and more stuff

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and emerging on the
other side and feeling

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:90%
lighter and more available.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And the possibilities
started to emerge

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.720 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't see before.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's
directly related.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:90%
You need to unpack your story.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:84%
You need to understand the
cost of what you went through.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So many of us said,
yeah, OK, yeah.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.820 align:middle line:90%
My dad shouted at me.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he hit me a few times.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:90%
And here's the classic.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Because that was the generation.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what they did.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:90%
My dad had that with his father.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.225 align:middle line:90%
My father did the best he could.

00:27:51.225 --> 00:27:52.600 align:middle line:10%
And the problem
there-- and maybe

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.250 align:middle line:10%
he did-- but we need to isolate
the trauma from the person.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
understand the trauma

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and how it affected you
away from the individual,

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:84%
one is it allows you to
understand who you are

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and how you are the way you
are today, and what drives you,

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and what holds you back.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And secondly is it allows you
to heal the relationship that

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:84%
has caused this to
begin with, and allows

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.880 align:middle line:84%
you to create empathy
and understanding

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what that person
was going through at that time.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> To get to that place takes
time and takes awareness,

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:84%
because I think this concept
of hurt people hurt people is

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.640 align:middle line:84%
something that we don't
really acknowledge very much.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We say that, well, my father did
that because he was an asshole,

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:42.760 align:middle line:84%
or that he was just a
mean person whereas,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.165 align:middle line:90%
how did he become like that?

00:28:45.165 --> 00:28:48.032 align:middle line:84%
What lineage did he have of his
experience and his childhood?

00:28:48.032 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I think these are
interesting questions to ask.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:53.063 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that you often
find when people do that work?

00:28:53.063 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:90%
They're like, oh, wow.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I realize why my
dad was like that.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think there's so much
anger and judgment present when

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:84%
the trauma has not
been addressed.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're not ready
to even entertain

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:84%
the idea of why their father did
what they did or their mother

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.410 align:middle line:90%
did what they did.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.952 align:middle line:84%
But when they can start to heal
the trauma within themselves,

00:29:09.952 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:84%
separate it from the
individual, and they

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:84%
can start moving through
some of the stories,

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.100 align:middle line:84%
they can start integrating the
rest of it and living with it

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and seeing that
there is an upside--

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a very, very,
very sensitive subject when

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
you say, when you
present the idea

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps some goodness
came from the trauma

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.592 align:middle line:90%
that you've experienced.

00:29:29.592 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And people have to be
ready to hear that,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and ready to receive that.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:90%
And then they're open.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
When they start to see there's
something good in this,

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:84%
there's a learning in this,
there's an awareness in this,

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:84%
then they're ready to go back to
the father they haven't spoken

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.770 align:middle line:84%
in 10 years, the mother
they have ostracized out

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:46.570 align:middle line:90%
of their life.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And even the ones
that have passed away,

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:90%
and to create healing there.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And some of the greatest joy I
get is when I hear the stories.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:84%
My father or myself are talking
for the first time in 10 years.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And I got a man recently
to do something.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.850 align:middle line:84%
He's got a very estranged,
volatile relationship

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:04.698 align:middle line:90%
with his father.

00:30:04.698 --> 00:30:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And he could sit in
front of me and tell me

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:84%
stories that when he crashed his
father's motorbike many years

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:14.470 align:middle line:84%
ago, his father came to the
scene, got the motorbike,

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:19.570 align:middle line:84%
threw it in his truck,
absolutely ripped him apart.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:84%
-- left him on the side of the
street and tore off in his car.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And that was the anger speaking.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we moved
through the anger,

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.900 align:middle line:84%
we moved through the trauma,
we moved through the hurt,

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.910 align:middle line:84%
I asked him to tell
me that story again.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.503 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you know,
I wasn't hit by another car,

00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what I told my dad.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.795 align:middle line:84%
I was driving too fast
and my father knew it.

00:30:40.795 --> 00:30:44.483 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.483 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, what about having that
conversation with your dad?

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:90%
And he wrote a letter.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him to
write the letter

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and allow me to read
it with his permission,

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.155 align:middle line:84%
to take out some of
the little snipes,

00:30:56.155 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:84%
things like, well,
I did my best,

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:58.905 align:middle line:84%
and because you
were never there.

00:30:58.905 --> 00:31:00.070 align:middle line:90%
You know that dig?

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:90%
And I just asked him, go first.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Just go first.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, do you
remember that bike?

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.245 align:middle line:84%
I was driving too fast,
but you know that already,

00:31:09.245 --> 00:31:10.832 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sorry.

00:31:10.832 --> 00:31:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember this?

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:13.660 align:middle line:90%
I lied to you.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.226 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:31:15.226 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.933 align:middle line:90%
That's not true, Dad.

00:31:19.933 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:84%
I did all this because
I wanted your attention

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.082 align:middle line:90%
and I wanted your love.

00:31:23.082 --> 00:31:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason he
didn't write the letter

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't want
to write the letter

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:27.635 align:middle line:84%
is at the end of
it he just said,

00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:90%
I want a relationship with you.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.820 align:middle line:84%
If this is something you
want with me, let me know.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
He was afraid of the answer
coming back being, no.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.680 align:middle line:84%
He got a phone call within an
hour of that letter arriving,

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and they had the conversation,
the conversation that he never

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.004 align:middle line:84%
imagined would
happen in his life.

00:31:50.004 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:90%
Ever.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.600 align:middle line:90%
I have a father who--

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:90%
we've been fortunate.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's not me.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is coming
through me, whatever I do,

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.955 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know what it is.

00:32:01.955 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And we get lots of
testimonials, and this and that.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
But we got a letter
from a man one day.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.033 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for giving
me my son back.

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the son came back
after this week in Ireland

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and sat with his
father and went first.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.265 align:middle line:10%
And I do this
exercise, and I say

00:32:16.265 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:10%
to people, name one
relationship in your life

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.200 align:middle line:10%
that you want to deepen.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.790 align:middle line:90%
One relationship.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Despite the fact-- and
this is the key piece--

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.590 align:middle line:84%
whether they have ever
demonstrated a desire

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.350 align:middle line:84%
to deepen it, are capable of
deepening it, because people--

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:90%
oh, you don't know my father.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.160 align:middle line:90%
You haven't met my mother.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.120 align:middle line:90%
They're human.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Trust me, I have a
fairly good handle on it.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Pick the person you
almost don't want to pick.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Then I ask them to
identify, what is the thing

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:90%
that that person needs to do?

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Not you.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:51.210 align:middle line:84%
What do they need to do in
order to facilitate a deepening

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.273 align:middle line:90%
in your relationship?

00:32:53.273 --> 00:32:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And it could be something
like, well, my sister just

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.610 align:middle line:90%
needs to be vulnerable.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Stop having all the goddamn
answers and always being right.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
I twist it and I go,

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:84%
are you doing the thing that
you want from them back?

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And if people are honest,
typically the answer is no.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:16.322 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is a wonderful
gift to give to somebody else,

00:33:16.322 --> 00:33:18.280 align:middle line:84%
but forgiveness is probably
one of the greatest

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:90%
gifts you can give to yourself.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're holding a
grudge to somebody else,

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
you're paying the
price every single day.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Go first.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.340 align:middle line:90%
What have you got to lose?

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Say sorry.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Say, I'm wrong.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Say, I'm scared.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Say, I don't know.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The three most beautiful
words that every parent

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.180 align:middle line:84%
should have every single day
in front of their children.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, son.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Allow your kids to see
your humanity so they

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:90%
begin to recognize their own.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:55.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You ran a talk, One Last
Talk recently in prison.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:06.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
amazing, first of all.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me about how hard
it was to make that happen?

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And then talk me through some of
the eventual outcomes of that,

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.870 align:middle line:84%
because I found that
quite an impactful story.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.760 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.659 align:middle line:84%
>> So it started with asking
a man who has been released,

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.500 align:middle line:84%
who committed murder, to stand
on stage and share his one last

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:90%
talk.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:90%
And that happened in Boulder.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And when you do a One Last
Talk, you don't go on the stage

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and say, hi, my name
is, I'm glad to be here,

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.272 align:middle line:90%
thanks for-- any of that stuff.

00:34:36.272 --> 00:34:40.340 align:middle line:84%
You just walk out and
you begin your story.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:42.469 align:middle line:84%
And he walked out,
and his opening line

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:84%
was something along the lines
of, on September 5, 1999,

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.969 align:middle line:84%
I shot and killed--
and he named the man.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.877 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, and I tried to
shoot and kill three other men.

00:34:52.877 --> 00:34:53.960 align:middle line:90%
That was his opening line.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:57.980 align:middle line:10%
You could feel the
energy shift in the room.

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.240 align:middle line:90%
You could feel the judgment.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.637 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the eyes
in the back of my head.

00:35:01.637 --> 00:35:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And he walked through
his story and he says,

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to
justify what I did.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to say,
here's my story.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:90%
This is why I did it.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:90%
That's up to you.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.000 align:middle line:10%
I have to live with my
consequences of something

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.310 align:middle line:10%
that I did that I'm
deeply ashamed of.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.500 align:middle line:84%
But I've been asked here
today to share my story,

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I'm going to do.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And he shared his story.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the talk, he said,

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a letter that never went
to the mother of the victim.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.400 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't find her.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.900 align:middle line:10%
And he reached into
his back pocket,

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:29.960 align:middle line:10%
and he opened up the letter,
and he read the letter

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.950 align:middle line:10%
to the mother of the
man that he shot.

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:10%
It was one of the most
extraordinary things I've ever

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.240 align:middle line:10%
experienced in my life.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:10%
And what came next was
more extraordinary.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.273 align:middle line:10%
We had 120 people
or so in the room.

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:43.940 align:middle line:84%
He got an overwhelming
standing ovation.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.357 align:middle line:84%
And one man took
the mic and said,

00:35:45.357 --> 00:35:48.056 align:middle line:84%
can I just apologize
for judging you?

00:35:48.056 --> 00:35:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And personally, the thing that
moved me the most is my then

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.950 align:middle line:90%
nine-year-old boy--

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and I never do one of
these, go and kiss granny

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:58.630 align:middle line:84%
or go and give your man a hug
or go and tell him he's great.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.940 align:middle line:84%
When Quan got off the
stage, my nine-year-old son

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.040 align:middle line:84%
walked up, put his
arms around him,

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.710 align:middle line:84%
hugged him, held it, and
said, I loved your talk.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And Quan looked at me
and just broke down.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
gateway into prison.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.910 align:middle line:10%
That was the opportunity to
work with an organization

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.750 align:middle line:10%
to get us into the prison,
and to bring an audience

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:24.362 align:middle line:10%
and to put six men
on the stage to share

00:36:24.362 --> 00:36:26.820 align:middle line:10%
their one last talks, five of
which I believe had committed

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.220 align:middle line:10%
murder, are serving time
for committing murder,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.680 align:middle line:10%
and one was a sex offender.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And what was so extraordinary
about the sex offender was

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.230 align:middle line:90%
he was the last speaker.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I've almost died, very
close to death twice,

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and yet I have never
seen another human

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.650 align:middle line:90%
being more scared in my life.

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:10%
I thought I understood
fear and scaredness

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.028 align:middle line:10%
until I looked at this
man as he began his talk.

00:36:50.028 --> 00:36:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And I stood up and
I walked up to him

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:90%
and I said, are you afraid?

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, I'm beyond afraid.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:58.980 align:middle line:10%
It's the first time he's
ever spoken about his story

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.363 align:middle line:10%
and who he was as a person.

00:37:01.363 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that
in a prison system,

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.738 align:middle line:84%
there's a very strong
likelihood that you

00:37:04.738 --> 00:37:07.770 align:middle line:90%
could be beaten up or killed.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.513 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
he was afraid of.

00:37:10.513 --> 00:37:11.930 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't afraid
of being stabbed.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.222 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't afraid of getting
the shit kicked out of him.

00:37:14.222 --> 00:37:18.260 align:middle line:84%
He was so afraid of
sharing all of who he is.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:22.220 align:middle line:84%
He was afraid of
not being accepted.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.560 align:middle line:84%
He was afraid and
not being seen.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And he knows what that's like,
because that is his whole life.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.200 align:middle line:84%
He went on to describe
one part of a story

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.320 align:middle line:84%
that he was raped himself
every single day for six months

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.835 align:middle line:90%
by his own father.

00:37:35.835 --> 00:37:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And what was the most
astonishing piece

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.150 align:middle line:84%
was the inmates stood
up, bawling, crying,

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:42.440 align:middle line:90%
went up and hugged him.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Said, I've got your back.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I was judging you.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:10%
And three women
who we invited in--

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:53.030 align:middle line:10%
my wife included-- had been
raped, one woman very viciously

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.760 align:middle line:10%
over multiple periods of time.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And each of them went
up and embraced him.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But where the wheels come
off for me emotionally

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.840 align:middle line:84%
was the last place
where the woman who'd

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.390 align:middle line:84%
gone through the most sexual
abuse turned to her husband

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:08.663 align:middle line:84%
and she said, I don't
want him to leave.

00:38:08.663 --> 00:38:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, what are
you talking about?

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.440 align:middle line:84%
She says, I don't
want him to leave.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't want him to go
back into the population.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I want to protect him.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I want to keep him safe.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:19.060 align:middle line:90%


00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And the healing that
happened in that room

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:84%
is beyond anything I have
ever imagined in my life.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.077 align:middle line:84%
I never imagined I would be
a tiny part of something that

00:38:28.077 --> 00:38:29.910 align:middle line:84%
could help create that
or bring that to you.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I never imagined I'd sit in
a room and experience that.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.302 align:middle line:84%
I've never experienced healing
in my life like that day.

00:38:36.302 --> 00:38:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And my own wife said to
me afterward, she says,

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:90%
I finally get it.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.400 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
me wasn't about me,

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and yet that's what I've been
holding for the last 20 years.

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:47.200 align:middle line:84%
It was about all what
was going on for them.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to create
separation for the first time

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:50.690 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:38:54.890 --> 00:39:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at that, when
I think about One Last Talk,

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.360 align:middle line:90%
it's bigger than me.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.755 align:middle line:90%
It's more important than me.

00:39:02.755 --> 00:39:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
I don't feel I have--

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.932 align:middle line:84%
I feel as if I have
a moral obligation

00:39:06.932 --> 00:39:08.640 align:middle line:84%
to bring that to the
world, because there

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:84%
is nothing I have
experienced that it

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.310 align:middle line:84%
creates healing and connection,
and therefore eradicates

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.268 align:middle line:90%
loneliness.

00:39:13.268 --> 00:39:17.660 align:middle line:90%


00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> This concept of separating
the person from the artifact,

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.680 align:middle line:84%
or at least not judging
or blaming that person,

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be the secret
to your ability to help people

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:37.450 align:middle line:84%
break free from this fear and
pain that they're holding onto

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.860 align:middle line:90%
in so many ways.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Is that the crux that you're
trying to lead people to?

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Is that the opportunity
you see in this?

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to
connecting with--

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.050 align:middle line:84%
helping people connect,
because connection

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:90%
is what it's all about for me.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, people think
it's about business.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It's about helping
people connect

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.735 align:middle line:84%
to meaningful work,
meaningful relationships,

00:39:52.735 --> 00:39:54.152 align:middle line:84%
and a relationship
with themselves

00:39:54.152 --> 00:39:55.585 align:middle line:90%
that they're truly proud of.

00:39:55.585 --> 00:39:57.565 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one day
walking into a workshop,

00:39:57.565 --> 00:39:59.352 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how
this lady did it.

00:39:59.352 --> 00:40:01.310 align:middle line:84%
There must have been 30
people at the workshop.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:02.810 align:middle line:10%
And by the time we
started, she must

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:10%
have got around to everybody,
everybody in the room,

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:10%
and shared her tragedy.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And her tragic story
was that her husband

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.880 align:middle line:84%
cheated on her in
the most obnoxious,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:90%
horrendous, disgusting way.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And she managed to get to
every single person pretty much

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:84%
in the room and
download this story

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and receive the
type of attention

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.342 align:middle line:90%
that she had been used to.

00:40:25.342 --> 00:40:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I walk in, and the
first question I

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:84%
ask, intuitively, I just
said, so what brings you here?

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here, really?

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And she was-- and I said,
you're obviously eager to go.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, yeah.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:90%
My husband ripped my heart out.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:90%
My life has turned upside down.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I was blindsided.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:44.470 align:middle line:84%
This happened a year ago,
and no one saw it coming,

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.378 align:middle line:90%
and my life is in turmoil.

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
didn't see it coming?

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:49.310 align:middle line:90%
She goes, no.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.970 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see it coming.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You could feel the energy,
everyone in the room, go,

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.570 align:middle line:84%
oh, god love her,
and everything else.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't
believe you for one second.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.080 align:middle line:90%
I'd never met her before.

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.600 align:middle line:90%
She goes, excuse me?

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.540 align:middle line:90%
I said, you are so smart.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:84%
You come across as
being so intuitive.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.800 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me you
did not see this coming?

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.720 align:middle line:84%
You're telling me
you had no sense

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.020 align:middle line:84%
that this possibility was
going to exist in your life?

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:17.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe you.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:20.240 align:middle line:90%
And the anger emerged.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.140 align:middle line:90%
She was vibrating.

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.840 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to rip my head off,
which is not uncommon sometimes

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.040 align:middle line:90%
initially.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.553 align:middle line:84%
And I said, are you
angry right now?

00:41:27.553 --> 00:41:28.970 align:middle line:84%
She goes, no, no,
no, No, I'm not.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:29.770 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And she looked like she was
going to strangle somebody.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let's just name the
anger that's present, and let's

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.490 align:middle line:84%
just drop just below that,
and let's see what emerges.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And her head drops, and she
shook and shook and shook.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:10%
And she lifted her face, and
the tears pouring down her face.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I knew
it the day I met him,

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and I knew I shouldn't
marry him the day

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:54.160 align:middle line:90%
I walked down the aisle.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:58.150 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.640 align:middle line:84%
People might say,
well, why would you

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:90%
facilitate uncovering that?

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you why.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.480 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So she never repeats
the same pattern again,

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.290 align:middle line:84%
that she understands
her part in it.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he was an asshole.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he did something wrong.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.830 align:middle line:90%
But she knew it.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.455 align:middle line:84%
She picked the wrong
person because she

00:42:13.455 --> 00:42:15.730 align:middle line:84%
was so attached to
being in a relationship

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that she chose to ignore the
red flags on the peripheral,

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.850 align:middle line:84%
because she had her
eyes on the prize,

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:23.560 align:middle line:84%
because she didn't
believe she could

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.760 align:middle line:84%
be happy on her own
journey in this world,

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:84%
that she needed somebody else
to validate and support her.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And now that she understands
that, she's aware of that,

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.110 align:middle line:90%
she can forgive.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.940 align:middle line:90%
She can let go.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:84%
She can let go of
the charge, and even

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:45.910 align:middle line:84%
get to the point to
forgive her ex and free

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.150 align:middle line:84%
herself of the burden, and
allow love to come into her life

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.072 align:middle line:84%
where perhaps there
was no space for it.

00:42:51.072 --> 00:42:55.140 align:middle line:90%


00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems a lot of your work
is based in vulnerability.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Is this a key element to
helping people unlock what

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.730 align:middle line:90%
they're hiding?

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Vulnerability to me
is just someone's truth.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just all of them.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And people work very,
very hard to present

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.420 align:middle line:84%
the parts of themselves that
they want the world to see,

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.390 align:middle line:84%
whether it's on Facebook or
whether it's in a room with me.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:21.996 align:middle line:90%
And I just--

00:43:21.996 --> 00:43:23.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't stop to think about it.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I just create a space to
allow people to show up

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.520 align:middle line:90%
and to open up.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And you know, people
are running very fast,

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:37.210 align:middle line:84%
people who are moving so
fast and so busy, just afraid

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.790 align:middle line:84%
to stop and to
connect emotionally

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.100 align:middle line:84%
with the very thing
they're avoiding.

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:45.460 align:middle line:10%
I had a business owner
recently who has made it

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.290 align:middle line:10%
multiple times over in
terms of financially.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:51.790 align:middle line:10%
And he just says, I
don't have any friends.

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.710 align:middle line:90%
It's lonely.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And what he has done is he's
doubled down on the very place

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.972 align:middle line:84%
that he feels that he's deriving
value, that he's presenting

00:43:59.972 --> 00:44:01.930 align:middle line:84%
value to the world, where
he gets significance,

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:03.130 align:middle line:90%
and that's his work.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's why he has
become a workaholic.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:10%
And my job is to allow
him to get to the place

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:14.310 align:middle line:10%
where he presents his truth,
and then we can build on that.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But unless that truth emerges,
if someone's hiding something

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.415 align:middle line:84%
from themselves and therefore
me, I can't really help them.

00:44:19.415 --> 00:44:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And all I'm asking you to
do is to show up and show

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.390 align:middle line:84%
me all of you, and I promise
you I will never judge you.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.852 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.852 --> 00:44:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> How can people really not
know they're hiding something,

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.110 align:middle line:90%
though?

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so insidious
the ways that we go out

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.320 align:middle line:84%
into the world
and we work and we

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.880 align:middle line:90%
prove our sense of self-worth.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're doing
this whole thing,

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.495 align:middle line:84%
we're putting on
these masks every day.

00:44:38.495 --> 00:44:40.620 align:middle line:84%
These masks, these new
masks about who we should be

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:90%
or what I'm going to do next.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And then how do we even know
who our real self is anymore?

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.320 align:middle line:90%
How do we-- like, really.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.130 align:middle line:90%
How do we?

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.900 align:middle line:84%
How do we understand
that part of us

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that's eternal, that's always
us, that's always been us?

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:55.590 align:middle line:90%
That's tricky work.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the key to
that is letting go of the things

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that we hold on to that
are part of our identity.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And that scares us.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.785 align:middle line:84%
It's like not being
a very strong swimmer

00:45:06.785 --> 00:45:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and then asking
someone to let go

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:09.950 align:middle line:84%
of the bar at the
side of the pool.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And they feel very vulnerable,
and they feel out of control.

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And control is this new,
emerging obsession with people.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.820 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in control,
then I'm safe.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
a complete illusion.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:24.445 align:middle line:84%
And I look back even at my own
life and I think to myself,

00:45:24.445 --> 00:45:26.320 align:middle line:84%
no one asked me, did I
want to be a Catholic?

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.120 align:middle line:90%
I was told I was a Catholic.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.320 align:middle line:84%
No one asked me, do I
want to be Christian?

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.190 align:middle line:90%
I was told I was a Christian.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:30.500 align:middle line:84%
No one asked me, do I
want to go to school?

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.590 align:middle line:90%
I was told to go to school.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.465 align:middle line:84%
No one asked me, did I
want to learn algebra?

00:45:33.465 --> 00:45:35.250 align:middle line:90%
I was told you learn it.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.060 align:middle line:90%
That was useful.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Not.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.970 align:middle line:90%


00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.945 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at
our lives in a very--

00:45:41.945 --> 00:45:43.320 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that's missing,

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.220 align:middle line:84%
James, when it comes
to exploration of self,

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.620 align:middle line:84%
what's completely missing
in so many people's lives

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.750 align:middle line:90%
is curiosity.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I sat in front of
a couple one day.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I was asking them to describe
where they would love to live,

00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because they were on
polar different pages.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.547 align:middle line:84%
At least that's
what they thought.

00:46:00.547 --> 00:46:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But 99.9% of couples want
exactly the same thing

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.783 align:middle line:84%
in my experience, yet we just
speak a different language.

00:46:05.783 --> 00:46:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And I asked them to connect.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And they ultimately
came to this conclusion

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that they both
wanted to move home

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.490 align:middle line:84%
to where they were
both born in BC

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:15.370 align:middle line:90%
up in the mountains in Kelowna.

00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But their faces
were contracting,

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and they were like, oh, jeez.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:19.910 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was hard.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And you know, making it complex
and making it challenging.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.348 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, guys,
what are you-- stop.

00:46:25.348 --> 00:46:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at me,
and they said, what?

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I said, if we had a guy standing
outside the door looking in

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.610 align:middle line:84%
through the window
and he couldn't

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:34.880 align:middle line:84%
hear what you were saying
about re-imagining your future

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and moving to a place
that nurtures you,

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and he just had to look
at your body language

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and he had to assess what
you were talking about,

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:43.985 align:middle line:84%
he'd probably come and go,
is she dying of cancer,

00:46:43.985 --> 00:46:45.840 align:middle line:84%
or have they both got
six months to live?

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Which is it?

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:51.230 align:middle line:84%
We make this shit so
complex, and it is so simple.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I love
to invite and challenge people

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:57.650 align:middle line:84%
to do is act upon what we know
as opposed to what we do not.

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm living in Boulder,
Colorado, and I don't like it,

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.510 align:middle line:84%
the biggest obstacle
I'll put my way

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is, but I don't know
where I do like, James.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where is next.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:14.050 align:middle line:84%
My answer is if it's
not Boulder, anywhere.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.260 align:middle line:10%
But what if I move to
Seattle and I don't like it?

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.690 align:middle line:90%
You move again.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:84%
We put so much emphasis
on the next move

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:25.830 align:middle line:84%
that it stifles us
from doing anything.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.247 align:middle line:84%
People come to me for clarity
about where they should move

00:47:28.247 --> 00:47:29.663 align:middle line:84%
and businesses
they should set up.

00:47:29.663 --> 00:47:30.840 align:middle line:90%
I go, let's look at reality.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at your
current reality.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.080 align:middle line:90%
What is working?

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.955 align:middle line:90%
And let's start there.

00:47:34.955 --> 00:47:36.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the simple
place to start.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the common threads
that you've had throughout this

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:42.825 align:middle line:84%
conversation we've had-- and
it's been very enlightening,

00:47:42.825 --> 00:47:48.100 align:middle line:84%
thank you-- is this idea that
we are more disconnected now

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:84%
despite being in a world
that's more connected than ever

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.000 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I think,
if I'm correct here,

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:57.160 align:middle line:84%
that's the core
wound you're trying

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to heal in trying to prove
that we are connected,

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:00.670 align:middle line:90%
we are related.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And we've been taught in these
ideals of the evolution theory

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.040 align:middle line:90%
that it's all about competition.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And then science is
now proving that, no.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.247 align:middle line:84%
The big trees don't crowd the
light from the little trees.

00:48:10.247 --> 00:48:13.900 align:middle line:84%
They give nutrients via the
mycelium and via the mushrooms

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.120 align:middle line:84%
they grow and the fungi
underneath the soil

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.208 align:middle line:90%
to support those trees.

00:48:17.208 --> 00:48:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And in certain other
times, the small trees

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.740 align:middle line:90%
support the big trees.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.780 align:middle line:84%
There is an enormous
web of cooperation

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.070 align:middle line:90%
that happens in the world.

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And my question to
you is, how do you

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.590 align:middle line:84%
think we start to heal these
big problems, the disconnect,

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:32.520 align:middle line:84%
the emotional trauma,
the locking it all down,

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.590 align:middle line:84%
the repeating it again,
generation after generation?

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.230 align:middle line:84%
How do we start to solve some
of these huge problems that

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.540 align:middle line:84%
could really, if we
did solve them, help

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.757 align:middle line:84%
to unlock possibilities
that could potentially

00:48:43.757 --> 00:48:46.090 align:middle line:84%
solve the biggest problems
that we face on planet Earth,

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I think?

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, obviously I'm biased,
and obviously I'm connected

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.727 align:middle line:84%
to what we're doing
through One Last Talk.

00:48:53.727 --> 00:48:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's the
answer, but it's certainly

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:57.950 align:middle line:90%
our way of doing this.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Another avenue for this
is through the lens

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.870 align:middle line:84%
of organizations
and corporations.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, you've got
so many millions of people

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.930 align:middle line:84%
who get up in the morning, go
to a community or an office

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:84%
or a job or a business,
and then they come home,

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.245 align:middle line:84%
they watch Netflix, they go
to sleep, or they watch FMTV.

00:49:16.245 --> 00:49:18.787 align:middle line:84%
And they go to sleep, and they
wake up the following morning.

00:49:18.787 --> 00:49:19.990 align:middle line:90%
It's rinse and repeat.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And for many of those,
their community,

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:24.190 align:middle line:84%
their village is
the place they work.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And we hear all the
time around culture.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, this culture and
that culture and whatever.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:32.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's getting so noisy.

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.585 align:middle line:84%
To me, culture is built on
nothing other than trust.

00:49:35.585 --> 00:49:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you can create
an environment where people

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.293 align:middle line:84%
can understand why they don't
trust themselves and begin

00:49:40.293 --> 00:49:42.793 align:middle line:84%
to reconcile that, then they
start to trust their intuition.

00:49:42.793 --> 00:49:44.376 align:middle line:84%
Then they start to
trust their bodies.

00:49:44.376 --> 00:49:45.940 align:middle line:10%
Then they start to
trust each other.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.870 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's all built on
this sense of trust inside.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, someone
said, you know,

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:53.033 align:middle line:84%
companies are never going to
allow One Last Talk to happen

00:49:53.033 --> 00:49:53.950 align:middle line:90%
in their organization.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.200 align:middle line:90%
It's just not going to happen.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.533 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to create
that sense of vulnerability.

00:49:57.533 --> 00:50:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's a theory called
the self-determination theory.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.722 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if
you've read about it.

00:50:01.722 --> 00:50:04.060 align:middle line:10%
And it cites after
massive research

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.700 align:middle line:10%
that human beings deeply
desire three things.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:09.550 align:middle line:84%
They want to feel
competent at what they do,

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.680 align:middle line:84%
they want to feel authentic
in their own lives,

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and they want to feel connected.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:18.153 align:middle line:84%
And we're now going into
multiple organizations,

00:50:18.153 --> 00:50:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're creating an
environment where people

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:23.070 align:middle line:84%
stand up and share a very
vulnerable part of themselves

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:26.840 align:middle line:84%
to a community of people
that they work with.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening,
which I knew

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:33.180 align:middle line:84%
intuitively was going to happen,
but now we have the proof,

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.460 align:middle line:84%
is that connection
goes through the roof.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.960 align:middle line:90%
Attrition goes down.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Loyalty starts to happen.

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.180 align:middle line:90%
This sense of, I have your back.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And this sense of
belonging and connection

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:47.462 align:middle line:84%
is emerging within
cultures and companies.

00:50:47.462 --> 00:50:49.420 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know how we
do it on a global scale,

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.900 align:middle line:10%
but I do know this,
is that we've all

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.480 align:middle line:10%
got to take some degree
of responsibility for it.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I think I have a moral
obligation as a father

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.550 align:middle line:84%
to work on my own
shit, even the stuff I

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:90%
don't know that's there.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And I trust that by
doing that, my kids are

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.790 align:middle line:90%
going to be in a better place.

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.707 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing I'd
add to that is something

00:51:07.707 --> 00:51:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that I feel has worked extremely
well for us is recognize,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:15.012 align:middle line:84%
no matter what I do, I'm
going to mess my kids up.

00:51:15.012 --> 00:51:17.220 align:middle line:84%
No matter how good a parent--
if I hug them too much,

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:17.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to mess them up.

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.270 align:middle line:84%
If I never hug them at all,
I'm going to mess them up.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is I'm never

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:84%
going to give up on
my kids, but maybe I

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.940 align:middle line:84%
can let them go a
little bit and not

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:30.270 align:middle line:90%
need to be the perfect father.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:34.020 align:middle line:10%
And that has given me a
degree of peace to give myself

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.920 align:middle line:10%
a break when I lose my temper
or I have a short or I'm this

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.630 align:middle line:10%
or I let myself
down, is that I don't

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:41.730 align:middle line:10%
turn into this spiral
which takes me a week

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:42.870 align:middle line:10%
to get back out of.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I forgive myself, I
name it, I apologize.

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's move on.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And kids always seem to
forget and then forgive.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:54.460 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:90%
I've noticed that.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:middle line:84%
In my worst moments,
I feel bad, and I

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.430 align:middle line:84%
feel like I've caused
irreparable damage.

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning, there is
a hug and a kiss and a look.

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I love you.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.440 align:middle line:90%
How you doing?

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wow.

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:06.940 align:middle line:90%
You forgive me?

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.045 align:middle line:90%
What another opportunity, right?

00:52:10.045 --> 00:52:14.440 align:middle line:10%
>> I asked a man recently
to share his One Last Talk

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.170 align:middle line:10%
on stage.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:19.890 align:middle line:10%
And he shared for the first
time ever-- he wasn't even sure

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:20.880 align:middle line:10%
why he was sharing it.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.047 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
challenges with One Last Talk

00:52:23.047 --> 00:52:25.800 align:middle line:84%
or anything else is
that I think deep down,

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.120 align:middle line:90%
we all want to make an impact.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But the challenge is we all
want to look good doing it.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.033 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if I share this
talk, I might be judged.

00:52:35.033 --> 00:52:36.450 align:middle line:84%
If I share this
talk-- and I said,

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:40.480 align:middle line:84%
yeah, your talk is about
you, but it's not for you.

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.910 align:middle line:84%
It's your story, but
it's a gift to the world.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have to trust
that if you do this

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and you trust this
process and you trust me,

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:48.790 align:middle line:90%
this is going to be OK.

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.840 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be more than OK.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And he shared the day that
he put the barrel of the gun

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.590 align:middle line:84%
into his mouth and had
his finger on the trigger,

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and he was about
to take his life.

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And he remembered that when he
looked or considered suicide

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:07.220 align:middle line:84%
in the past that three of his
friends came to him and said,

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:08.915 align:middle line:84%
if you want to kill
yourself, that's OK.

00:53:08.915 --> 00:53:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not
OK, but that's OK,

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.550 align:middle line:84%
because we can't prevent
you from doing it.

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to ask
you to do one thing.

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.480 align:middle line:84%
We're going to ask you to
take a list of our names

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and our numbers, and we're
going to ask you to call us

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:21.990 align:middle line:90%
to say goodbye before you go.

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:25.320 align:middle line:90%


00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said, that
list is the very thing

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that I go to every time I'm
about to commit suicide.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And he finishes this
extraordinary talk.

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:36.740 align:middle line:84%
He gets an overwhelming
standing ovation.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.600 align:middle line:90%
I just-- not this--

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.400 align:middle line:90%

--one person.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.290 align:middle line:90%
People burst onto their feet.

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:44.220 align:middle line:84%
They give him a
standing ovation.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.407 align:middle line:84%
And then I turn it
to the audience.

00:53:46.407 --> 00:53:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And this woman puts her
hand up, and I said,

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.130 align:middle line:84%
would you like-- she says,
why didn't you tell me?

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:51.930 align:middle line:90%
It's his sister.

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:54.940 align:middle line:90%


00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, with respect,
you're making this about you

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.540 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:02.780 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.962 align:middle line:84%
The next person was
his grandmother.

00:54:04.962 --> 00:54:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I want
him to know that he

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.150 align:middle line:90%
is loved beyond measure.

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And the next woman who
wasn't related at all

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.670 align:middle line:84%
took the microphone
and said, Chris,

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:16.770 align:middle line:84%
can you be the first
name on my list?

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:24.380 align:middle line:84%
When you share the parts
of yourself that scare you,

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.240 align:middle line:84%
when you share the
parts of yourself

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that you're ashamed of, when
you share the parts of yourself

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.880 align:middle line:84%
that you deeply regret, when
you allow the world to see

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.030 align:middle line:84%
all of you, it is the
only time the world

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:36.020 align:middle line:90%
can accept all of you.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:39.230 align:middle line:90%

You don't have to do a
One Last Talk to do that,

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.617 align:middle line:84%
but I would encourage people to
share the parts of themselves

00:54:44.617 --> 00:54:46.700 align:middle line:84%
that they've spent a lot
of time and energy hiding

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.010 align:middle line:84%
from the world, and
watch how free you feel.

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:52.860 align:middle line:90%


00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And watch what you can
do with that energy.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe, just maybe,
you can go out into the world

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.898 align:middle line:84%
and inspire other
people to do the same.

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's a world
I want to live in.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:08.260 align:middle line:90%
