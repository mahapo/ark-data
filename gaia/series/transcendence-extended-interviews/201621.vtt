00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:07.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.770 align:middle line:10%
It's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.800 align:middle line:10%
And today, I've got an
incredibly inspirational guest.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.950 align:middle line:10%
She has endured
unimaginable suffering

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:10%
and has risen up to achieve
things that defied the odds.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:84%
She's a living example
of what is possible

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and the mental
resilience that is

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:84%
required to rise up against
some incredible challenges.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.707 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Turia Pitt,
and I'm incredibly

00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:90%
excited to speak with her.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:90%
How are you, Turia?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, James.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm excited.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.914 align:middle line:90%
So let's start at the beginning.

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> What was it like growing up
in the Turia Pitt household?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a really
idyllic childhood.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:84%
We lived-- our house overlooked
this really awesome surf break.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.638 align:middle line:84%
So before school every
morning, we'd go out surfing.

00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And we'd come home from school.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:90%
We'd go for a surf.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't have a TV.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a firm believer
that TV rotted your brain.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We had to be very
independent, self-sufficient,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.209 align:middle line:90%
and make our own fun.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And we had a really awesome
mom who loved us so much.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:90%
She loved us unconditionally.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
She poured so much love
into all of us kids.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:90%
I've got three brothers.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And my dad was the opposite.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:90%
He was a real hardass.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So not in a bad way-- but
growing up, we had two rules.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:90%
Rule number one was no whinging.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Rule number two was
no bloody whinging.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.940 align:middle line:90%
So he was really tough.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:90%
He was really a disciplinarian.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt
with my mom, she just

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
gave her love so freely.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.055 align:middle line:84%
But with my dad, you really
had to earn his respect.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess I
got lucky in that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.868 align:middle line:84%
if I just had one
of the parents,

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:84%
maybe I would have been
a different person.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:84%
But I had this really unique
concoction or this really

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:90%
unique blend for my upbringing.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember once,
my brothers and I,

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:90%
we missed the bus to school.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And we knew dad would just be
so furious if he found out.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So we skipped school,
and dad found out.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:90%
And he was so mad.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.147 align:middle line:84%
And he dug this big
trench in the backyard.

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And we had to run from our house
10 minutes down to the beach,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
grab a handful of sand,
run 10 minutes back home,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
place it in the
trench, and we weren't

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
allowed to stop until
that night, when

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.480 align:middle line:90%
the trench was full.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:90%
So a total hardass--

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
but I'm grateful
for that upbringing

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
because I had this real
sense, even as a young child,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that if I worked hard
and if I applied myself

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and if I was determined
enough, I could do anything.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, interesting
combination.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I can relate in
some aspect to that.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And running has become and
is a big part of your life.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Was there a stage
of your upbringing

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
where that cemented itself
as a passion in your life?

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess it was again--

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't so much
that it was a passion.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:90%
I just loved surfing.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.310 align:middle line:90%
That was where I had fun.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's where
I could express myself.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I loved reading
because I could enter

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
a world that I constructed
purely with my imagination.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't have a TV.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't many options
for stuff we could do.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go for
runs every morning

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.652 align:middle line:90%
before school with my dad.

00:03:18.652 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember he'd
be running behind me.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And he'd say, keep up.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:90%
Run faster.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And I guess how
I'm discovering--

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm making my dad out
to be a real asshole.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:90%
But he wasn't.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
He did what he believed
was best for us kids.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And now as an adult,
when I look back at it,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm really grateful for
all of those lessons.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So 2011, you're
running an ultramarathon.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:90%
But you don't build up to that.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Had you run marathons
before, 5Ks, half marathons?

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:90%
What was the--

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I'd just done
half marathons and stuff.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:90%
I was a mining engineer.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in the
middle of Australia.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I had this really awesome
job at this diamond mine.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.635 align:middle line:84%
My partner was up there
with me, and I was away

00:04:04.635 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
from the coast for the
first time in my life.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:90%
So I started to run.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd do these really big
runs after work, because I also

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:90%
found my job quite stressful.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.779 align:middle line:84%
Engineering is really a
male-dominated industry,

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and mining engineering
even more so.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:84%
My graduating class,
there were 60 males.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And there were four girls.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:90%
So there wasn't many girls.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.070 align:middle line:90%
So it was--

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I guess I found that stressful.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.673 align:middle line:84%
And so after work,
a lot of miners

00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
would go and have a
couple of beers and stuff.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:90%
But I would just run.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
So some nights, I would run 30
kilometers or whatever it was.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And that was how, I
guess, I kept myself sane

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.240 align:middle line:84%
whilst I was out at
the mine at work.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>> So I can appreciate that.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a surfer myself, so I go
to the ocean to get that peace.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So if I was not near the ocean,
I'd be hiking or running.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So you find something
else to replace that with.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been a
very physical person.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.152 align:middle line:84%
And for me, being active,
that's my therapy.

00:05:11.152 --> 00:05:12.860 align:middle line:84%
If you feel depressed,
you go for a surf.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:90%
You feel better.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
If you feel angry,
you go for a run.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:90%
You get it all out.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:90%
You think of a solution.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And you come back, and you
feel a lot better, as well.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's one
of the best things you

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
can do to moderate or to
alleviate some of your moods

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and to change your
mood, as well.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Emotion comes
from motion then.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That was from Tony Robbins,
and he's also quoted on.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:90%
That is from Tony Robbins.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's about
changing your physiology,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
like when I was younger,
if I was in a bad mood,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
my dad would put
me in the shower

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and turn the water on
cold because that's

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
a really quick way to
change someone's physiology.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.970 align:middle line:84%
My dad didn't know
that at the time.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:90%
That was just what he did.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
But that changes
someone's physiology.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And then they can change
how they're feeling.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Powerful.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.743 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking notes for when--

00:06:07.743 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You can do that
with your kids.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.280 align:middle line:90%
See how they like it.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.572 align:middle line:90%
>> They probably won't like it.

00:06:11.572 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> See how they like it.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.653 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't-- I'd always
been good at running.

00:06:16.653 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:84%
I was always great
at running at school.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I was always a good
cross-country runner.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
because I was fast.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I just had that--

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:90%
I just don't stop.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I can just keep going.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think running,
more than anything,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
it's a mental game, because when
you're on a really long run,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%
your body gives up.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:90%
But your mind doesn't.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And your mind has got
to be strong enough

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:84%
to say, no, you've just got
to be able to keep going.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:84%
You've just got to
take the next step.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.292 align:middle line:84%
You just need to get
to the next checkpoint

00:06:45.292 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
or to the next
milestone or whatever.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What made you sign up
for that 100-kilometer?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I just like challenges.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:90%
I just always--

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I've always really
liked challenges.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And I really think
that it's only

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
by challenging
ourselves and stretching

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and getting
outside of our comfort zone.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:90%
That's where we grow.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And we all like our comfort
zone because it's safe.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:90%
We know what it's like.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing wrong about
hanging in your comfort zone

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:90%
every now and then.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But you also don't
grow in there.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I signed up
to do that ultramarathon.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was
in September 2011.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk me through the day,
the build-up to the race,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and then--

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was excited.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:90%
It was another challenge for me.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:90%
It was something--

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I guess something for me
not to tick off my box,

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
but something for me to get
to learn a little bit more

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
about myself and what
type of person I was.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And the start of the
run, it was really hot.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:90%
We're in outback Australia.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And summer had just ended,
so it was 40 degrees, really,

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:90%
really hot.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was enjoying myself.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:90%
I was enjoying the run.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:90%
I was enjoying the challenge.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And about a quarter of
the way through the race,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
about 25 kilometers through
the race, I was running.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.343 align:middle line:84%
And I started to get
fatigued, so I had something.

00:08:11.343 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
I had some food,
I had some water,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.640 align:middle line:90%
and I put in my headphones.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I was running,
and I heard this noise.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
the next checkpoint

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
was over the other
side of the highway.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought the noise
was the sound of road trains.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
A road train is like
a really big truck.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.140 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it was the sound
of road trains coming down

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:90%
the highway.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And that actually gave me a lot
of energy because I thought,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:90%
that's cool.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm almost to the next--

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:90%
almost to checkpoint three.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And with running,
especially, you

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
don't think about the
whole day in its entirety

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
because that's
really overwhelming.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.355 align:middle line:90%
So I always just take--

00:08:53.355 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
just got to get to
the next checkpoint.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.313 align:middle line:90%
That's all I've got to focus on.

00:08:56.313 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
The next checkpoint's
four kilometers away.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:90%
I've got it.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.585 align:middle line:90%
So that actually made me--

00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:90%
that kind of spurred me on.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.168 align:middle line:84%
And I got this real
rush of energy,

00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
like, yep, almost
to checkpoint three.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:90%
You've got this, girl.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And as I ran through this gorge,
I noticed these other runners

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.050 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
looking at this big fire

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:90%
that was fastly approaching.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
noise that I heard.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It was the sound of
a fire coming really

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.820 align:middle line:90%
quickly through the gorge.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.173 align:middle line:90%
And the thing about a gorge--

00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you know
what the Venturi effect is.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But when there's a lot
of hot air moving around

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and it gets funneled through
a small condensed space, which

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:44.660 align:middle line:84%
was the gorge, it almost
sucked the fire through.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So we were in this gorge,
and I was panicking.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if I was ever
going to make it out alive.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I actually
started to cry.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.118 align:middle line:90%
I panicked.

00:09:57.118 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And there was this man
who was in the gorge

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.327 align:middle line:84%
with me, one of
the other runners.

00:10:00.327 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:90%
And he saw that I was upset.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:90%
He was a perfect stranger.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And he took precious seconds
in that life-or-death situation

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.265 align:middle line:90%
to reassure me.

00:10:09.265 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:90%
He said, don't worry.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.307 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be OK.

00:10:11.307 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think our
capacity as humans,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
our capacity for
kindness and compassion,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
even in the worst
moments, even in

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
a literal life-or-death moment,
I think it's really phenomenal.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened next,
it happened so quickly.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
It must have only been
10 seconds, maximum.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
But the fire got sucked
through the gorge.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I was trapped in the
gorge, and I ended up

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:90%
being burnt all over my body.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, this is it.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:90%
This is how I die.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
about how unfair it was

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and that I'd never see
anyone I loved ever again.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And then after the fire
had passed, I was still,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
of course, in a shock of
state, in a shock of disbelief,

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
like, what the
fuck just happened?

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I was still standing.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:90%
And I was still alive.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the
thing about shock

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.270 align:middle line:84%
is that it's kind of like
your body's defense mechanism.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
It's to keep you alive until
you can get medical help.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:90%
So the next couple of hours--

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how long it was.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Time had dilated.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:90%
It had constricted.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who I
was really talking to.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up getting
helicoptered out of that gorge

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
about four hours
later after the fire.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And I got transferred to the
hospital in a little town.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I woke up a month
later in Sydney Hospital.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.467 align:middle line:84%
And that was where
the real work began,

00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:84%
because I always get asked what
the pain of the fire was like.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.015 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it hurt.

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But you can't
really describe it.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a couple of
seconds of pain.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But being in hospital, having
to realize the task that

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:84%
laid before me, not being
able to even roll over

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:90%
in bed by myself--

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and I guess just to me, that
was when my job really began.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:10%
>> The helicopter had somebody
in it you knew, right?

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me what happened
when that helicopter came down?

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a volunteering
ambulance paramedic who was

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.830 align:middle line:90%
there on-site to help me.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:90%
And I recognized her.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, hey Bonnie.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.257 align:middle line:84%
And she just-- she
didn't recognize me.

00:12:44.257 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know who I was.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.173 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it's me.

00:12:46.173 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:90%
It's Turia.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.455 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't
say anything back.

00:12:48.455 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed a tear start
to roll slowly down her face.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So even though I was in this
state that, yeah, I'm sweet,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
like, going to go to
hospital, get patched up,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
I'll be back at
work on Monday, I

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:84%
had this sense that maybe
something bad had happened.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you were still
cognizant and alive.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you went
to the hospital.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
You said you woke
up a month later.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess because I
was put in an induced coma.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
They performed
escharotomies on me.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So an escharotomy is
when they sliced you

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.770 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
leg down to your ankle

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:84%
to relieve the pressure,
because after a burn,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:90%
you start to swell up.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:90%
And then I got flown to Sydney.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
when you're burned,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.217 align:middle line:90%
they need to debride your skin.

00:13:52.217 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And debriding just means
they need to remove

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:90%
all of the burnt skin.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, they need
to cover you with something.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And real skin is the
best stuff to use,

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't have
any in Australia.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So they got skin donated
from people in America

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:90%
sent to Australia to cover me.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And then--

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's crazy.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those things,
like, it's so crazy,

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:90%
it's unbelievable.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it happened.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And you woke up from
this coma how long after

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:90%
the incident?

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And what was the first thing
that went through your mind

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.217 align:middle line:84%
when you woke up
in that hospital?

00:14:29.217 --> 00:14:30.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't--

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I was on a lot of
pain medication.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.270 align:middle line:84%
I was in and out
of consciousness.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think it was
almost maybe two months

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:84%
later until I really
realized what had happened.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But I did get a real insight
into it because one morning,

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.265 align:middle line:90%
this guy came into my room.

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was short,
and he was fat.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.440 align:middle line:90%
And he was bald.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.577 align:middle line:84%
And he had this thick gold
chain around his neck.

00:14:55.577 --> 00:14:57.410 align:middle line:84%
So I thought he was a
gangster or something.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:58.452 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know who he was.

00:14:58.452 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh,
good morning, Turia.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:90%
My name is Frank.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm your physiotherapist.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to help you
learn how to stand again.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.303 align:middle line:84%
And he managed to get
me in bed and pull me

00:15:11.303 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:90%
in a sitting position.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And it was complete agony.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.810 align:middle line:84%
It was the most pain I've ever
felt in my whole entire life.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled me
up onto my feet.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
sobbing, just sobbing

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and crying all over his fat
neck into his gold chain.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that was
really the moment when

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I realized how big
this challenge was

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:84%
that I was facing,
because I couldn't even

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:90%
stand up by myself.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:43.130 align:middle line:84%
So the thought of being able to
walk again, run again, compete

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
again, go back to work, have
a family with my partner,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:84%
those things just seemed so far
away and so impossible for me

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized really
early on in that day

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't think--

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't spend all this
time and energy worrying

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
about what my future was going
to look like, because that

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:90%
was just too far away.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:90%
It seemed insurmountable.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I
would literally just

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:90%
take each day as it came.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And if I did well at
my physio session,

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.940 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, good job, Turia.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.737 align:middle line:90%
You smashed that physio session.

00:16:19.737 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:90%
You did really well.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Every night, before I went to
sleep, I'd think of the things

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that I'd done really
well that day.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'd think of
the qualities that I

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
had that made me the perfect
prototype for this challenge.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the prognosis
from the doctors?

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Did they say things like
you'd never walk again

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.263 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to
be in a wheelchair?

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:41.150 align:middle line:84%
What did-- and just before
we go on to that question,

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
can you tell me so we've
got a sound bite of this

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:84%
how long that race was, because
I think we skipped over it.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:90%
I think I--

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, we did.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know how many
miles that is or not?

00:16:49.565 --> 00:16:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>> 100 kilometers is like--

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.747 align:middle line:90%
I think it's 60 miles, maybe.

00:16:52.747 --> 00:16:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe just say, I went to
compete in this ultramarathon.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So I was competing in
this ultramarathon.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And an ultramarathon's
100 kilometers

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.019 align:middle line:90%
or 60 miles or whatever.

00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.607 align:middle line:90%
So what was the prognosis of--

00:17:09.607 --> 00:17:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> The medical team.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:84%
The prognosis from
the medical team,

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.800 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't super optimistic.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think in a way,
of course, it can't be.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.175 align:middle line:84%
They can't just
say to a patient,

00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
be kicking goals.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.633 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be living
the life of your dreams.

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be out
there getting it done.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know who I was.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know about my past.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.120 align:middle line:84%
They just had to prepare me as
best they could for my future.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So they said, you might
not be able to run again.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.190 align:middle line:84%
You might not be
as active and be

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
able to do all those crazy
things you like doing,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.110 align:middle line:84%
like surfing and rock
climbing and running.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:56.670 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that
you'll probably drive again.

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:57.770 align:middle line:90%
You'll probably get a job.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably go back to work,
and you might even get married.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I just
thought that was just--

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I was so infuriated because I
just thought, like, fuck you.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't know who I am.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.548 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
I'm capable of.

00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think I found
that so infuriating

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:84%
was because I'd
had an accident--

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.767 align:middle line:84%
or I'd always been a
really high achiever.

00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I'd always done
really awesome things.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But because I'd had an accident,
suddenly, the bar for me

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.370 align:middle line:90%
was just placed right down here.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't like that.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, I was able
to use that as motivation

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.057 align:middle line:84%
to really go out and forge a
really amazing life for myself.

00:18:38.057 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I got told
that, I thought, you know what?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.557 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to show you.

00:18:41.557 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do an
Ironman one day.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't
know what an Ironman was.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was
the guy on the back

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:54.007 align:middle line:84%
of the Nutri-Grain packet, which
is like an Australian cereal.

00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought, you know what?

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.257 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to show you.

00:18:56.257 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do an Ironman.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've always had really
amazing people around me.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And I remember telling Michael,
my partner, and my mom.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm going
to do an Ironman.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.552 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't say to
me, oh, that's silly.

00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You've got to kind of listen
to what the doctor said,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:90%
and that's unrealistic for you.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
They just said,
oh, awesome idea.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.107 align:middle line:90%
Let's get you up.

00:19:20.107 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's go get you training.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's go get you working
for this Ironman.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So I think that having
people that believe in you

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and who are willing
to back you and who

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:84%
are willing to take
part in your dreams

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:84%
with you, that's such
a beautiful thing.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:90%
So I'm really grateful.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:84%
I've always had really
incredible people in my life--

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:84%
my mom, my dad, my partner,
my friends, my family.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:90%
You are lucky.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't openly
support everyone else's dream.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And so how cool is that to go
through a catastrophic injury,

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:84%
be lying there in
a hospital bed.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:90%
You've got a skin [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.017 align:middle line:90%
You weigh 30 kilograms.

00:20:00.017 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And you say to people, I'm
going to do an Ironman.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, come on.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:84%
We've got to go get
out of bed then.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get you training.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And even every morning, when
you're in hospital, the nurses,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
they normally make your
bed for you and everything.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But my mom, she wouldn't
let that happen.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:84%
She said, no, you've got
to make your own bed.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:90%
This is your job.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take
ownership of this.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.870 align:middle line:84%
My partner, Michael,
he would go out and buy

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.157 align:middle line:90%
me all of these sports clothes.

00:20:33.157 --> 00:20:34.740 align:middle line:84%
There's this brand
in Australia, Lorna

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Jane, that's got these really
inspiring slogans on it.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:84%
It was a little bit corny, but
things like "never give up."

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'd be in this
little hospital

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
mask with this full-body
compression suit

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.600 align:middle line:84%
with these inspiring
slogans on my singlets.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And it sounds really corny.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, I appreciated
having these people

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:90%
who so beileved in me.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And they so wanted
me to get better.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And just it was so
beautiful of them

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
to show up for me every day
consistently and be there.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Even if I was in a bad mood,
even if I didn't feel strong

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that day, even if I felt
really overwhelmed by what

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I was doing, they were there
with me every single day.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Michael was there every day
from 7:00 in the morning

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:90%
till 7:00 at night.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:90%
He's a pretty cool guy.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.556 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:36.556 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:90%
>> A legend.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he's awesome.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.770 align:middle line:90%
He's a legend.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think at
the same time, you

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:90%
can have all of this support.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You can have all these amazing
people around you, which I had.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But I still had to be the
one who would push myself

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.210 align:middle line:84%
in my physio sessions,
who would go and say,

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
let's go do the
stairs one more time.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's go do this.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Let's go do that.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.262 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense,
it was a team effort

00:22:00.262 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:84%
because they had
to show up for me.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.340 align:middle line:90%
And I had to show up for myself.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think back to
that time in hospital.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And even though it was a
really dark time in my life,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:84%
it was also maybe
the most transcendent

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:90%
because I was stripped back.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:90%
I was raw.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I was vulnerable.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And I had these people
with me every day

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.037 align:middle line:90%
who helped me and supported me.

00:22:27.037 --> 00:22:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, Turia.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:28.310 align:middle line:90%
That's so lovely.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want a
tissue or something?

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'm actually all right.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm all right.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:84%
No, it makes me happy
talking about Michael.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's funny that you can
reflect on that moment and see

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
it as one of the biggest
gifts of your life.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a strange
thing, right?

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
The depths of despair
can be a big gift.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess it's all
how you look at things.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And for sure, I'd
never wish what

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:90%
happened to me on anyone else.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:90%
It was tragic.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:90%
It was painful.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.020 align:middle line:90%
It was horrific.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, going
through what I've been through,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:90%
I've learned heaps about myself.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I've also learned a lot
about the people around me.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The stairs was a pretty
powerful place for you to build

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:84%
your emotional resilience
in the hospital.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us?

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, it
was this challenge.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I did one
flight of the stairs,

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that
was a good effort.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:90%
So I told one of my surgeons.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And he just said,
oh, well, yeah.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:84%
You're only a girl,
so you wouldn't

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.600 align:middle line:90%
be able to do much more.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And just again, I just
thought, fuck you.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.123 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember the next
morning, Michael, my mom,

00:23:43.123 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and I, we started
from the bottom.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:48.688 align:middle line:84%
And we just kept doing stairs
after stairs after stairs.

00:23:48.688 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I did the
whole flight of stairs.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to my room that
night, and I was exhausted.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
I just thought, yeah,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.100 align:middle line:90%
I've proved you wrong.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:10%
>> And do you think doing
things sort of in spite of some

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.990 align:middle line:10%
of those horrible comments was
a powerful motivator for you?

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to temper this
by saying the comments weren't

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:90%
necessarily horrible.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So when my medical team tried
to prepare me for my new life,

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:84%
they weren't trying
to be assholes.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.660 align:middle line:84%
That was just how
I interpreted it.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm grateful for it because
it gave me the strength.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.030 align:middle line:84%
It gave me the motivation
to want to go and do

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:90%
these really crazy things.

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So what my surgeon said,
maybe he said it differently.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.895 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he said,
well, you're a girl.

00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:90%
You've got to take it easy.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I guess with everything
in life, nothing

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
has meaning unless it's a
meaning that we give it.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I took those
comments, and I turned it

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:54.450 align:middle line:84%
into this thing, sort of
like a bit of stuff-you

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:90%
or a fuck-you moment for me.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:84%
But that's what I do in a
lot of things in my life.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Good for you.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So from a time
frame perspective,

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:90%
you had the incident.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.700 align:middle line:84%
You woke up in the
hospital how long later?

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And then when was it that
you got out of hospital?

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:90%
What was that time?

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So I probably got out of
hospital six months later.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:90%
We went back home.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And I guess when
you're in hospital,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:90%
it is a bit of a bubble.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.072 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.072 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Every day, I was really busy.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:90%
I had physio.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:90%
I had OT.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:90%
I did my stairs.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.550 align:middle line:90%
I did my stairs religiously.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.350 align:middle line:90%
I'd eat.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Then at nighttime,
I'd go to sleep.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:90%
I'd be so tired.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And then I got home.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I was like,
this is actually really shit

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:84%
because I'd been made
redundant from my job

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:90%
as a mining engineer.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Michael was my full-time carer.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.670 align:middle line:84%
We were living at
his parents' place.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was hurtful
because everyone else

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:90%
had kept living their lives.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.415 align:middle line:84%
All of my friends from uni
were working these cool jobs

00:26:01.415 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and going overseas
and going traveling.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:90%
And people were getting married.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt like I
was stuck in a time warp.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't-- and
my life was so shit.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I made that
decision or I made that choice

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:29.460 align:middle line:84%
to keep going and to keep
trying to create a really

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
good life for myself, because
the alternative wasn't

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:90%
very attractive.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you manage some of
that emotional healing from

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:90%
trauma?

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was hard.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.028 align:middle line:90%
And it was hard.

00:26:42.028 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I did
was I had a psychologist.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I had a weekly standing
appointment with her.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think friends and
family, they're awesome.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And I love mine.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, they're
not trained professionals.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So they might not
know what to say.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And they might not know the
exact thing you need to hear.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So I had a standing appointment
with my psychologist,

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:90%
who was awesome.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:11.960 align:middle line:84%
She did amazing things
for my emotional recovery.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And also, just I
liked writing a lot,

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.250 align:middle line:90%
which I found really cathartic.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And for me, my sense of self has
always been really closely tied

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.048 align:middle line:90%
to my physical abilities.

00:27:26.048 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So being in a hospital bed, not
being able to move, of course

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel like myself.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.258 align:middle line:84%
But I'd go to the
gym with my dad,

00:27:32.258 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be able to do something
that I couldn't do next week.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Or I'd go to the
physio sessions,

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:90%
and I'd work my ass off.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.342 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd say,
well, I did that work

00:27:42.342 --> 00:27:43.300 align:middle line:90%
and I got a bit better.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.683 align:middle line:84%
So if I do more work, then
maybe I can get even better-er.

00:27:46.683 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:90%
And that doesn't make sense.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.140 align:middle line:90%
But I can get even--

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I can improve even more.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So just the more I regained
my physical abilities,

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.310 align:middle line:90%
the more I felt like old Turia.

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that you
had as part of your recovery--

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:90%
please, drink some water--

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:84%
as part of your recovery
was wearing a mask.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that stayed
on for quite some time,

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.720 align:middle line:84%
maybe a few years
after the incident.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me about
the physical component

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of wearing the mask and
how you were perceived

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and then what it felt like to
take that mask off and face

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:90%
the world?

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So I wore the mask
for medical reasons.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It was to compress my skin
and to help flatten and heal

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:90%
my scars.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So it was really
beneficial for me.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.490 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it was
really bloody uncomfortable.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:90%
And I hated wearing it.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
But this strange thing
happened, in that it became

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:90%
a huge part of my identity.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.110 align:middle line:90%
It was on my driver's license.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.740 align:middle line:90%
It was on my passport photo.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And I got so used to
being with my mask,

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.070 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like a bit
of a security blanket.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the time came
where I had to take it off.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I didn't
want to take it off,

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.888 align:middle line:90%
because that was who I was.

00:29:08.888 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And so my psychologist
helped me out heaps there.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.070 align:middle line:84%
She said, just try not
wearing it around the house.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Try not wearing
it around friends.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Try going for a
walk without it on.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:90%
So I did a lot of those steps.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like two years with
this mask on, the next minute,

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
she's on stage in front of
1,000 people without a mask.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.430 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like that at all.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:33.870 align:middle line:84%
It was these really small,
boring, insignificant,

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.170 align:middle line:90%
consistent steps that I took.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And then what did it feel
like sort of facing the public

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.280 align:middle line:84%
in a way, because I've
interviewed people for this

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:84%
series, as well, that have had
big facial trauma from a car

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.380 align:middle line:90%
incident.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And having big scars on
the face, it's like a club.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.340 align:middle line:84%
You understand each other, but
it's a very different world.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:84%
What did it feel
like facing the world

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
as a completely
new-looking person,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:84%
taking this mask
off and facing them?

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I guess, like I said,
there was never a reveal,

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.545 align:middle line:84%
where I took my mask off
for the first time in front

00:30:11.545 --> 00:30:12.345 align:middle line:90%
of the public.

00:30:12.345 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I did it really small.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.180 align:middle line:90%
And I did it in my own way.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't wear it with
friends and family and then

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:90%
down the street.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I got
to the stage where

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:90%
I was like, this is me now.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.200 align:middle line:90%
And I've just got to own it.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I've got to be proud of it.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.348 align:middle line:84%
And I've almost got to be
able to wear it like a boss.

00:30:31.348 --> 00:30:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a
really good lesson in that,

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:36.540 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't have
a problem with something

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.820 align:middle line:84%
about yourself, no
one else will, either.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- you might
not experience this.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But as a woman, if you go
to a party and you're like,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.830 align:middle line:84%
does my ass look
fat in this dress,

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
then you're really
self-conscious about it

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:90%
all night.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.863 align:middle line:84%
But if you just go to
the party and you just

00:30:51.863 --> 00:30:55.080 align:middle line:84%
own it and you just embrace it
and you just wear it proudly,

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:90%
no one else cares.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So I think I came to realize
that the more I just accepted

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:84%
it and embraced it about
myself, no one else really

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:90%
had a problem, either.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Good for you.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the self-- so that taught
you a lot about self-esteem

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.528 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
if you just stand tall,

00:31:18.528 --> 00:31:20.570 align:middle line:84%
pull your shoulders back,
have pride in yourself,

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and just walk through
that public domain

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.040 align:middle line:84%
like a fucking boss, no one is
going to say anything about it.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.400 align:middle line:84%
How can you when someone
is so loud and proud

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and confident
about who they are?

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a powerful way
to overcome insecurities.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:39.570 align:middle line:90%
And that was a choice I had.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I could be really
demure and meek and try

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to make sure no one sees me.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you're wearing
a mask, people see you.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:90%
You stand out like a sore thumb.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And even if you look
like me, you stand out.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So you can either try
and hide and be meek,

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
lean into the walls,
or you can just own it.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.152 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've tried
to do throughout my journey.

00:32:05.152 --> 00:32:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't always been easy.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:11.100 align:middle line:84%
After I have an operation,
I'm really red and sore.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.260 align:middle line:90%
My skin looks really angry.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And you feel vulnerable
after you have an operation.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So in those times,
it's not easy.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.070 align:middle line:90%
I would prefer to be at home.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm giving a speech or if
I'm walking through an airport

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:84%
to travel, I don't
have that option.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So the option I take
is just owning it.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:32:33.422 --> 00:32:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of the people
that we've interviewed

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:84%
who have gone through some
pretty horrific trauma, one

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.420 align:middle line:84%
of the common themes seems
to be that the language they

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:84%
used to have about
their accident

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.900 align:middle line:90%
was quite victim-oriented.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.968 align:middle line:84%
They said, I nearly died
in this car accident.

00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:90%
It was this tragic event.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And they used it
as an opportunity

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:84%
to sort of attract pity
upon themselves in a way.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And then ultimately, it was when
they sort of changed the story

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
to an empowering one, like this
happened, but you know what,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I've learned so much from
it, that their lives changed

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.480 align:middle line:90%
from that point on.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Does how you
perceive your incident--

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.350 align:middle line:84%
do you believe that how you
perceive your incident affects

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.060 align:middle line:90%
your life today?

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And is there a
way-- did you decide

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:18.330 align:middle line:90%
one day to change the story?

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.147 align:middle line:84%
Shit, I can't just
be a victim here.

00:33:21.147 --> 00:33:22.230 align:middle line:90%
I need to change my story.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And what language do you
use around your story

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.750 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
that new positive self?

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.860 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it's about the
connotations of the words

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.360 align:middle line:90%
that we use.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, oh,
there's this burn victim

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.617 align:middle line:84%
and she suffered these
burns, I'm like, well,

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:40.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really a victim, though.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:41.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm a survivor.

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.165 align:middle line:84%
And even that term,
"burn survivor,"

00:33:44.165 --> 00:33:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't really
love that, either,

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.180 align:middle line:84%
because again, it's
just pigeonholing me

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
as this person who's gone
through a really tragic event.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:58.020 align:middle line:84%
so I'm really careful about the
words I use to describe myself.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:84%
If people say, oh, you look
disfigured, I say, well, no,

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.500 align:middle line:90%
I look different, first of all.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not denying that.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.530 align:middle line:90%
But I don't look disfigured.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I'm always
really careful and conscious

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.460 align:middle line:84%
about the words I use
to describe myself.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
And then if people
use words that I

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:20.120 align:middle line:84%
don't love the connotations
of, I just tell them.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:20.969 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.489 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are some of the
words that you don't like?

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:24.750 align:middle line:90%
You've mentioned some of them.

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.679 align:middle line:10%
What are some of
the words that you

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:28.199 align:middle line:10%
use to create a different
story, because it affects

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:10%
how you feel, whether
you become that person

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.810 align:middle line:10%
on the wall at the party or you
become that, I'm a survivor.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:34.630 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think so, like I said, I
don't like the word "victim."

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.830 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to
refer to my accident,

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.130 align:middle line:90%
I'll say I'm a "burn survivor."

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a "burn victim."

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.540 align:middle line:84%
If someone says, well, you
look disfigured, I say, well,

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.140 align:middle line:90%
I look different.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't look disfigured.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.940 align:middle line:84%
They're probably the
main words I come across.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.400 align:middle line:90%
But everyone can relate to it.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Are you skinny, or
are you slender?

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Are you fat, or are you curvy?

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Are you dumb, or are
you just learning?

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the words that
we use to describe ourselves

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:90%
and to describe our experiences.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
nothing really has

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.460 align:middle line:84%
meaning unless it's the
meaning that we give it.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So I could give what happened to
me this really horrible meaning

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that it changed my life and I
can't be an engineer anymore.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And I look disfigured,
and I had to go

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:90%
through all of that stuff.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.968 align:middle line:84%
If I look at it like
that, I feel really shit.

00:35:33.968 --> 00:35:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's like what I
do with my operations.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I just call it "reframing it."

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So I probably have about
three operations every year.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.612 align:middle line:84%
And no one looks forward
to having surgery.

00:35:46.612 --> 00:35:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I look at it
through the negative frame.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.650 align:middle line:84%
What are all the negatives
that come with it?

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's no guarantees.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.270 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.568 align:middle line:90%
It's painful.

00:35:55.568 --> 00:35:57.360 align:middle line:84%
I've got to take all
of this time off work.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll feel really shit and
valuable because I've just

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.850 align:middle line:90%
had an operation.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And why go through
all of that pain

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.582 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know what
the outcome's going to be?

00:36:09.582 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So I look at it through
that, and it's like, yeah, it

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:90%
seems pretty shit.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And then I say, OK.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, look at it through
the positive frame.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.040 align:middle line:84%
What are all the positives
that can come up with it?

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the only
way you get to improve.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
way you can do it.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.390 align:middle line:84%
You get to catch up with all
of the old medical team who

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.540 align:middle line:84%
used to work with you and see
all these faces that actually

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:90%
saved your life.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.910 align:middle line:84%
You get a break from
work and from your life.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:31.910 align:middle line:90%
You get forced time-out.

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:84%
You get reflection
time and time to think.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.460 align:middle line:90%
Life's so busy.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.015 align:middle line:84%
How often do we give
ourselves that time?

00:36:38.015 --> 00:36:39.890 align:middle line:84%
You can lie around the
house in only pajamas.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:40.720 align:middle line:90%
You can watch Netflix.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.637 align:middle line:90%
You can eat ice cream.

00:36:41.637 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:90%
You can do whatever you want.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.400 align:middle line:84%
You can have your friends
and family visit you.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And so if I look at it through
that way, I'm like, yeah,

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.233 align:middle line:90%
it's still scary.

00:36:50.233 --> 00:36:51.900 align:middle line:84%
But these are all of
the positive things

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.020 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it, reframing.

00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I reframe
things all the time.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just reframing
that event that happened to me.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I could look at it like I'm
a victim and I'm disfigured.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Or I could look at it in
a totally different light.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And one, that makes me feel
a lot better about myself.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And it also gives me a
really positive meaning

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.490 align:middle line:90%
for what happened to me.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.260 align:middle line:10%
In terms of
resilience, it's a word

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.760 align:middle line:10%
that you've sort of lent on a
little bit in our conversation

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:10%
before this interview.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.450 align:middle line:10%
How resilient do you
think this has made you?

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.330 align:middle line:10%
And do you think that we're
much more resilient than we

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.785 align:middle line:10%
believe we are as humans?

00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think
we're much more.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:90%
I think we're infinitely more.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.542 align:middle line:90%
When times are tough and we--

00:37:39.542 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:84%
you read stories
of people who went

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.880 align:middle line:84%
through the Holocaust
or survivors

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:84%
from these really
horrific incidents.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And you think to yourself,
how did they do that?

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And they just did
because humans,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.980 align:middle line:84%
we're inherently-- we're
intrinsically resilient.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:90%
But we never get tested.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Think about how
safe our lives are.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:90%
We get up.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:90%
We go to work.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.510 align:middle line:90%
We have a shower.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.802 align:middle line:90%
We have food when we come home.

00:38:04.802 --> 00:38:08.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't really get any of
these challenges in our lives.

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when something
really challenging

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.210 align:middle line:84%
does happen to us and
maybe something that's

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:16.580 align:middle line:84%
not really that
challenging at all,

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.250 align:middle line:84%
we fall apart because
we've had no practice.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:84%
We've never had to flex
our resilience muscle.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think I owe a lot
of my resilience to my dad

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:84%
because putting me in cold
showers, being behind me,

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:34.340 align:middle line:84%
forcing me to run, making me
fill up at a trench with sand,

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.050 align:middle line:84%
all of these lessons as a kid,
that made me really resilient.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.890 align:middle line:84%
It made me really
self-sufficient.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I think I had
a lot of practice

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.550 align:middle line:90%
with my resilience muscle.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Doing crazy adventure
races and ultramarathons,

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:84%
that flexes your resilience
muscle even more.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So I think having gone through
all of my life beforehand,

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:58.310 align:middle line:84%
being a woman in a
male-dominated industry,

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:01.430 align:middle line:84%
going to classes at university
where you get told by your male

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.640 align:middle line:84%
peers that you don't
belong in that class

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:90%
because you're a woman--

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:84%
all of that stuff made
me more resilient.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And then my fire
experience I guess just

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.560 align:middle line:90%
cemented that for me.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Amazing.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And so do you believe that
people should go and practice

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.090 align:middle line:84%
acts of resilience in their
lives to prepare themselves?

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I guess I don't think that
they should lash themselves

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:84%
on the back in an act
of self-flagellation.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But as a parent, I
think about, what

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.967 align:middle line:84%
do I want for my son
Hakavai and my next baby?

00:39:39.967 --> 00:39:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you think,
well, I want them to be happy.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't want anything
bad to happen to them.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, that's
not the reality of life.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
What's going to
happen to my sons?

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.635 align:middle line:90%
They will fail at stuff.

00:39:53.635 --> 00:39:55.010 align:middle line:84%
They won't be good
at everything.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.050 align:middle line:84%
They might not get picked
for some sports teams.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:84%
They might get bullied,
all of that stuff.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:02.552 align:middle line:84%
And if I try to
inoculate them from that,

00:40:02.552 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I will have done
my job as a parent in preparing

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.470 align:middle line:90%
them for life.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's about
accepting failures,

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:12.830 align:middle line:84%
accepting bad things
are going to happen.

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:15.627 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
practice overcoming

00:40:15.627 --> 00:40:17.210 align:middle line:84%
those things and the
more you practice

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:84%
being in those awful
feelings, the better you are

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and the better you're going
to be at dealing with them.

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> I can appreciate that.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's not natural
because, as a parent,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.030 align:middle line:84%
you don't want anything
bad to happen to your kid.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.822 align:middle line:84%
You don't want them to
go through anything.

00:40:33.822 --> 00:40:36.920 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not natural for
me to want my kid

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.550 align:middle line:90%
to go through hard times.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:47.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to accept that
that's part of him growing up.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to try and
protect them from any of that.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So excuse my naivete.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:53.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.093 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a child before
or after the incident?

00:40:56.093 --> 00:40:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>> After the accident.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So I had a baby two
years ago, and I'm

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.650 align:middle line:90%
about four months pregnant now.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:90%
So we're really excited.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.174 align:middle line:84%
We're creating our
own little tribe.

00:41:08.174 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so cool.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.452 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:41:12.452 --> 00:41:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You're going to have some
lessons for them, right?

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll be like, well, you
think you've got a hard making.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, wait till you hear
about what happened to me.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:24.260 align:middle line:84%
No, but it's like, do I
want to be this parent who

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.380 align:middle line:84%
just protects their kid from
all of the stuff that happened?

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.990 align:middle line:84%
Or do I want to be a little
bit more like my dad?

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Probably not going to be as
much of a hardass as my dad--

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.070 align:middle line:90%
that was crazy.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.760 align:middle line:84%
But you've got all
this opportunity

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:84%
to instill into your
kids these lessons.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to be very
conscious about what outtake

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.322 align:middle line:90%
that I want them to have.

00:41:46.322 --> 00:41:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Do I want them to
have that outtake

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.730 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to fix
everything for them?

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Or do I want them to
have that outtake of when

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.340 align:middle line:84%
bad shit happens, I have
that internal resources to be

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:00.830 align:middle line:90%
able to deal with it?

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The mental and
physical faculty.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:03.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.660 align:middle line:90%
Do I have that within me?

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So in our sort of
more modern landscape--

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:84%
so you and I probably grew up at
a time when there wasn't really

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.220 align:middle line:90%
internet.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It was just early days, and
there wasn't that much TV.

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> We used to have
that dial-up tone.

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>> You call your friends.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.787 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be at the beach
at 3:00 PM, and it's 8:00 AM.

00:42:25.787 --> 00:42:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you just hope
they're going to be there.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.235 align:middle line:90%
It was so much more of that era.

00:42:31.235 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously, our parents
had a completely different era.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.655 align:middle line:84%
But now, us in this
landscape today

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and our children and
the children growing up,

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:42.800 align:middle line:84%
we have this incessant
flow of information

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.990 align:middle line:90%
and especially social media.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.170 align:middle line:84%
People are portraying
these unimaginable lives.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.380 align:middle line:84%
They're so beautiful,
and they're so perfect.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.580 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're just living these
supposedly perfect lives

00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.290 align:middle line:90%
that they're doing.

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And then everyone is
sort of aspiring to this.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.860 align:middle line:84%
But everyone compares
themselves upwards

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to these almost
unattainable lives,

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.268 align:middle line:84%
like such beautiful people going
to the most idyllic locations.

00:43:13.268 --> 00:43:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
look at my life.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:16.852 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got this
sort of self-esteem issue

00:43:16.852 --> 00:43:20.510 align:middle line:84%
these days, where people are
comparing upwards and not

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:22.430 align:middle line:84%
really being grateful
for what they have

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and always feeling a sense
of lack in their lives.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.150 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this is a
challenge, first of all?

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And how do you think you've
managed that process in a way?

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And how do you think
people can sort of manage

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:41.360 align:middle line:84%
this process of this comparison
and the lack of self-love

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and the self-esteem
issues that come?

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:47.952 align:middle line:84%
There's always a good and
bad for everything, right?

00:43:47.952 --> 00:43:49.910 align:middle line:84%
There are so many positives
about social media.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.040 align:middle line:84%
There are so many positives
about the internet.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.915 align:middle line:84%
You have a question,
you type it into Google,

00:43:53.915 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:90%
you'll find the answer.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:90%
What did they do 30 years ago?

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.800 align:middle line:84%
They would've had to
go to an encyclopedia.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.990 align:middle line:84%
The encyclopedia might
have been 10 years old.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So I love the world
we're living in.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.460 align:middle line:90%
I love this digital age.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I love that you can
write something.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.730 align:middle line:90%
You can put it on a blog.

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of people can read it.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.260 align:middle line:90%
I love how we're all connected.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I understand what you're
saying about people

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.010 align:middle line:84%
do compare themselves to other
people's lives on social media.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just
about being cognizant.

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.920 align:middle line:84%
We know that those
lives bullshit.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.470 align:middle line:90%
You know that no one's perfect.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I guess it is dangerous when
a 12-year-old is looking

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.090 align:middle line:84%
at those images,
because they might not

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:42.530 align:middle line:84%
know that it isn't realistic and
that images are highly filtered

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and it isn't attainable.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even necessarily
desirable, either.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.500 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's just about
having that conversation

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.910 align:middle line:90%
with the kids.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And also, for me,
if I get caught

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.930 align:middle line:84%
into this cycle of comparison,
I think the easiest way

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.480 align:middle line:84%
to cut through that is
just to practice gratitude.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Practice gratitude for what
you do have in your life.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I practice gratitude
every single morning

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.360 align:middle line:90%
without fail.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I'll think of all of
these amazing things

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:14.900 align:middle line:90%
I have in my life.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I've got this incredible
man in my life who's

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.790 align:middle line:84%
got such inner strength
and such inner reserves

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:84%
that if I'd never
been burnt, I never

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.110 align:middle line:90%
would have seen that in him.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I've got this
beautiful little boy

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:35.390 align:middle line:84%
who makes me realize
that life is so precious.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And if I'd never been
through my accident,

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.720 align:middle line:90%
I might never have met him.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm creating this new
life inside me now,

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what this
next child will be like.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:48.470 align:middle line:84%
It's totally unknown,
but how exciting.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.570 align:middle line:84%
How cool is my
job that I get all

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:84%
of these awesome
opportunities, like coming here

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:55.978 align:middle line:90%
to speak with you today?

00:45:55.978 --> 00:45:57.020 align:middle line:90%
I get to work for myself.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.217 align:middle line:90%
I get to work from home.

00:45:58.217 --> 00:46:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I can go for a surf in
the middle of the day

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.850 align:middle line:90%
if the surf's good.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:03.550 align:middle line:84%
I can say to Michael,
let's go camping tonight.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So I practice gratitude
every morning.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:07.682 align:middle line:84%
And I think about
all of these things

00:46:07.682 --> 00:46:09.890 align:middle line:84%
in my life which are incredible
and which are awesome

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.045 align:middle line:84%
and everything I've
got to be grateful for.

00:46:12.045 --> 00:46:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you
practice gratitude

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and you're genuinely
grateful, you

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.520 align:middle line:84%
don't get sucked into
that comparison cycle.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.750 align:middle line:10%
>> And it puts you
in a state of joy.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:90%
And how awesome is my life?

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:27.370 align:middle line:90%
That's their life.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:28.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're doing.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Good for them.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:29.980 align:middle line:90%
I've got my own life.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm living the life
of my own dreams.

00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to
worry about them.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.920 align:middle line:10%
>> What sort of message do you
have for people who are going

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.340 align:middle line:10%
through hardship, not only
we've spoken about gratitude,

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:45.150 align:middle line:10%
but people who might be going
through financial turmoil

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:10%
or an illness or something?

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.050 align:middle line:84%
What sort of message
do you have for them?

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I think there's this
expectation in life

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.680 align:middle line:84%
that we have to be
happy all the time.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be
positive all of the time.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a bit like
that resilience message

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I was talking about.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's a
realistic expectation

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:08.320 align:middle line:90%
to have of yourself.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.010 align:middle line:90%


00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's necessarily
healthy for us, either.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you're
going through a hard time,

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.290 align:middle line:90%
it's OK to feel like shit.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:21.830 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to say, yeah,
this is really hard.

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:23.110 align:middle line:90%
This is really tough.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.990 align:middle line:90%
This is really testing me.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily
have to be able to spin it

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:31.830 align:middle line:84%
around straightaway and
say, oh, well, give it

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:35.130 align:middle line:84%
some pumped-up
bullshit because there

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:84%
is real power in just
accepting your situation,

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.900 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging it, and
saying, I feel like shit,

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.900 align:middle line:90%
but this will pass.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not always going
to be like this forever.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>> This soon, too, will pass.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Nothing in life is permanent.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.180 align:middle line:90%
Nothing lasts forever.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:48:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And if I look back at what
happened to me, I'm like, wow.

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Did I really do all of that?

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Did I really go
through that injury?

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And then did I really do the
Ironman World Championships?

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:09.900 align:middle line:90%
And did I-- that's crazy.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think having
that sense of hope

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.800 align:middle line:84%
that it might not be
today, but your future,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.860 align:middle line:84%
there's potential for
your future to be better.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> You've since,
after your recovery,

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:24.700 align:middle line:84%
gone on to achieve some
pretty phenomenal feats.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.890 align:middle line:84%
There was a run you did in
Sydney here, an Ironman.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain sort of in
a list what you've gone on

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.255 align:middle line:90%
to achieve after your recovery?

00:48:33.255 --> 00:48:36.650 align:middle line:90%


00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.850 align:middle line:90%
I've done some--

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:42.050 align:middle line:90%
I've done an ultramarathon.

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I've done an Ironman
event in Australia.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I competed in the Ironman
World Championships.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I can't really remember
everything now, I think.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.590 align:middle line:84%
But I've done some
really awesome stuff.

00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And I've done stuff
that I might never

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:06.105 align:middle line:84%
have put my hand up
for before my accident,

00:49:06.105 --> 00:49:07.980 align:middle line:84%
because I think after
what I've been through,

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:90%
during an Ironman, it's hard.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:12.120 align:middle line:90%
But it's not that hard.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I was running on
the Ironman course in Hawaii,

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:21.140 align:middle line:84%
in Kona, just battling with
my internal demons, I'd go,

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:22.170 align:middle line:90%
this has happened.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:26.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not as hard as what
you've been through before.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:30.920 align:middle line:84%
So I guess my
accident's given me

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:35.930 align:middle line:84%
this really awesome reference
point for what is actually

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.290 align:middle line:90%
a challenge in our world.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And so now, even with
speaking in front

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:41.910 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people,
I'm like, yeah, it's hard.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:42.710 align:middle line:90%
I get scared.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.600 align:middle line:90%
I get anxious, for sure.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:49.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's not it's what
I've been through hard.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:50.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the moments that
you're most proud of after

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:54.730 align:middle line:90%
your accident?

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>> My son.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, my son and
the relationships

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I have now with my friends
and family, for sure.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So I think at the
end of the day,

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:09.860 align:middle line:84%
even though we can
be single-minded

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and we can be
focused on our goals

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
trying to achieve,

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:15.320 align:middle line:84%
when you step back
from that and you

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.950 align:middle line:84%
think about what's
important in our lives,

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:20.360 align:middle line:90%
none of that stuff matters.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.792 align:middle line:90%
It's our relationships.

00:50:21.792 --> 00:50:23.500 align:middle line:84%
It's our relationships
with other people.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's my
relationship with my husband.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.590 align:middle line:90%
Actually, he's not my husband--

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that--
with my partner,

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.810 align:middle line:90%
with my partner and my son.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:35.092 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:35.092 --> 00:50:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Bronnie Ware talks
about that in "The Five Regrets

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Dying."

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.392 align:middle line:84%
She was a palliative
care nurse, and she

00:50:40.392 --> 00:50:41.600 align:middle line:90%
interviewed all these people.

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And they said, it
wasn't what I did.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.268 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't this.

00:50:44.268 --> 00:50:46.310 align:middle line:84%
The relationships are
something that she regrets.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, you think about what
actually matters in life.

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.450 align:middle line:84%
When you're down
to the wire, it's

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:57.320 align:middle line:84%
not doing Ironman
World Championships.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not all of the
things I've done.

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not at all.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I had that moment when I was
being burned alive by a fire.

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.590 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't thinking about my job.

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I just had this one person in
my head, and it was Michael.

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:13.932 align:middle line:90%
It was my partner.

00:51:13.932 --> 00:51:15.140 align:middle line:90%
That was all I thought about.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.580 align:middle line:90%


00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess that moment really
taught you what's most valuable

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.850 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:24.592 align:middle line:84%
Well, that moment
and everything else

00:51:24.592 --> 00:51:26.350 align:middle line:90%
I've learned since, I guess.

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's our relationships.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.010 align:middle line:90%
That's my view, anyway.

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:30.870 align:middle line:90%
That's my view.

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Before your incident-- and
I don't mean to reference this

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:36.710 align:middle line:90%
as this defining moment.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:38.290 align:middle line:84%
But it has been a
big thing for you.

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you think were you
a religious person?

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Were you a spiritual person?

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Did you meditate?

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Did you go to church?

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Were you a Hindu?

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:46.060 align:middle line:90%
Were you Buddhist?

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:46.960 align:middle line:90%
Were you Catholic?

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
incident, same question--

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.960 align:middle line:90%
have you developed something?

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm an atheist.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I've never been a
spiritual person.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.055 align:middle line:90%
I've never prayed.

00:52:01.055 --> 00:52:03.880 align:middle line:90%


00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:09.190 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, though, I do
have this really firm belief

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that all of us, we
can achieve so much.

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:14.050 align:middle line:90%
We have infinite potential.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's untapped, and
no one knows the limits.

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.020 align:middle line:90%
No one knows the limits.

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:18.950 align:middle line:90%
No one knows the bounds of it.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.617 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that you
have to believe in yourself.

00:52:21.617 --> 00:52:22.700 align:middle line:90%
You have to back yourself.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing to go
to those really dark places

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.460 align:middle line:90%
that no one else wants to go.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you'll find growth.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.480 align:middle line:90%
So is that--

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I guess when I say it like
that, it does sound a little bit

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.200 align:middle line:90%
spiritual.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think you
need to go to a church

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.860 align:middle line:84%
or you need to go through
a religious structure

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:43.660 align:middle line:90%
to find that.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I think we've all
got it in ourselves.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that this
was meant to happen for you

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:51.430 align:middle line:90%
for a reason?

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Again, I don't--

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:54.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm an engineer.

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very logical
and very pragmatic.

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.592 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
was meant to happen.

00:52:57.592 --> 00:53:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a random
unfortunate incident.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I do
think it might have happened

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to the right person, because
I did have it within me

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to overcome my adversity.

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And I did have it within me
to rebuild this really amazing

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:16.960 align:middle line:90%
life for myself.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And I did have these
incredible people around me

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:22.950 align:middle line:90%
who helped me to do it.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:23.963 align:middle line:90%
>> Unbelievable.

00:53:23.963 --> 00:53:25.630 align:middle line:84%
I've got one or two
more questions here.

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But one of them-- when
the incident happened,

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:29.970 align:middle line:84%
there was a handful of
other people with you.

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:31.320 align:middle line:90%
What happened to that group?

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So there were six of us who
were trapped by the fire.

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.740 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.940 align:middle line:84%
The really crazy thing
is that all of us

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.250 align:middle line:84%
are just living these
really amazing lives.

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:48.060 align:middle line:84%
The other woman who got
quite badly burnt like me,

00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.980 align:middle line:90%
she lost half of her foot.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But then she did
Marathon des Sables--

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.172 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've heard of that.

00:53:53.172 --> 00:53:58.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the ultramarathon
across the Sahara Desert--

00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.610 align:middle line:90%
on one foot.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:01.500 align:middle line:90%
She did that last year.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And now, she's like
a fire investigator.

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So she's working with really
high-up people on the coroner's

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.627 align:middle line:90%
court and everything.

00:54:13.627 --> 00:54:14.460 align:middle line:90%
So she's incredible.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.760 align:middle line:84%
But she's attacked her journey
quite differently from me.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:20.850 align:middle line:90%
She's quite a private person.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
she's not as strong.

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
she's not as capable.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:25.980 align:middle line:84%
She's done some really
awesome things and things

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:28.080 align:middle line:84%
that I'm thinking,
oh, I don't think

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I would do an ultramarathon
through the Sahara Desert.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.080 align:middle line:90%
But hey, you do you.

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Did anyone not make
it out alive from that?

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we all survived.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:40.980 align:middle line:90%
We all survived.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.220 align:middle line:90%
One other random thing--

00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I know in one of your talks,
you said that your hand's

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:47.550 align:middle line:90%
a bit like Bart Simpson.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I had
dinner once with--

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to connect you
with Nancy Cartwright once.

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:53.970 align:middle line:90%
She's the voice of Bart Simpson.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>> No way.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:57.477 align:middle line:10%
I was in Malibu having
dinner, and this lady

00:54:57.477 --> 00:54:58.560 align:middle line:10%
comes to the dinner table.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.130 align:middle line:90%
And there are six of us.

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:00.813 align:middle line:84%
She's like, hey, I'm
Nancy Cartwright.

00:55:00.813 --> 00:55:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And she gave me
her business card,

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and it said, "Voice
of Bart Simpson."

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:05.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no.

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's a lady?

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lady.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lady.

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And she gave me a
little bit of a Bart voice.

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:12.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, it's actually you.

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I was actually quite
enamored by that little fame

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:18.670 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never
forget that dinner.

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:22.513 align:middle line:84%
And when you mentioned
that you have--

00:55:22.513 --> 00:55:24.680 align:middle line:84%
can you tell me about your
fingers and how you joke?

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess I find
humor a really good way

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.145 align:middle line:90%
to get people to relax.

00:55:34.145 --> 00:55:35.020 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:38.570 align:middle line:84%
So I used to say this joke all
the time, that my hand looked

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:39.990 align:middle line:90%
a bit like Bart Simpson's hand.

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:42.450 align:middle line:84%
You know how the Simpsons
only have these four fingers?

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
an awkward joke.

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.790 align:middle line:84%
But it's also like,
I'm cool with it.

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:49.530 align:middle line:90%
So you be cool with it, too.

00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:51.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do
anything differently.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.380 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that's why
I try to use humor.

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I think if you see me talk,
I do make a lot of jokes.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's just to
get people to realize,

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:05.100 align:middle line:90%
this chick's cool with it.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.600 align:middle line:84%
She's owning what's
happened to her.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.420 align:middle line:90%
She's fine.

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.113 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to be different.

00:56:09.113 --> 00:56:10.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
act differently.

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:11.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything's good.

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:13.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of your
funniest jokes that you love?

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I used to do this
thing with my mask.

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:24.673 align:middle line:84%
I'd say it was on my
passport for years.

00:56:24.673 --> 00:56:26.340 align:middle line:84%
It was on my driver's
license for years.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I was like the friendliest
bank robber in town.

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:33.357 align:middle line:84%
People find that-- and those
jokes, they sound really corny

00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:34.440 align:middle line:90%
when it's just you and me.

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.050 align:middle line:84%
But they work when there's
a lot of people around.

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's just to show that I'm
not traumatized by my past.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:43.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful for it.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'm laughing about it.

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:46.970 align:middle line:90%
You can have a laugh, too.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:47.940 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:56:50.745 --> 00:56:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Probably at my final
question here-- and then

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.753 align:middle line:84%
I will ask you if there's
anything you think

00:56:54.753 --> 00:56:55.920 align:middle line:90%
you want to share or forgot.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is my last question for
you is that in the modern age,

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:02.800 align:middle line:84%
we're suffering from a lot of
mental disease, mental illness.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.100 align:middle line:84%
The WHO has referred to
this as one of the biggest

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.690 align:middle line:90%
crises of our time.

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:11.695 align:middle line:84%
Depression, anxiety-- suicide
rates are at an all-time high.

00:57:11.695 --> 00:57:14.070 align:middle line:84%
The previous series to this,
"Transcendence," series one,

00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:16.740 align:middle line:84%
was dedicated to a very close
friend of mine, Dan Bleney, who

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:20.850 align:middle line:84%
committed suicide and a strong,
resilient, amazing person.

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And it just seems
unimaginable that people

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.670 align:middle line:90%
would want to take their lives.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:27.210 align:middle line:84%
How do you think people can
achieve more fulfillment

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.928 align:middle line:90%
and happiness in their lives?

00:57:28.928 --> 00:57:29.970 align:middle line:90%
You seem to have done it.

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:31.762 align:middle line:84%
I know that you've been
through dark times.

00:57:31.762 --> 00:57:33.750 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's
been a struggle.

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But you seem to be
like, I've got this.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real sense of
happiness and fulfillment

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that you have a
passion to share.

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.870 align:middle line:84%
What advice do
you give to people

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:44.340 align:middle line:84%
looking to achieve
more fulfillment

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.548 align:middle line:90%
and happiness in their lives?

00:57:45.548 --> 00:57:50.338 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think definitely
seek professional help.

00:57:50.338 --> 00:57:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Like I said in the interview,
friends and family,

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:53.760 align:middle line:90%
they're awesome.

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:57.060 align:middle line:84%
But they also don't know
exactly what to say sometimes.

00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:59.610 align:middle line:84%
They haven't been to
university for six years

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:01.110 align:middle line:90%
and done all the training.

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.710 align:middle line:90%
So seek professional help.

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Don't-- I guess I feel a bit bad
that you have this image that

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm always like this, because I
think it's OK to have bad days.

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.670 align:middle line:84%
If I have a bad day,
I'll just accept it.

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll say, today's shit.

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Last week, it was the
anniversary of the fire.

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's been eight
years now, but I still

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:28.210 align:middle line:90%
felt upset on that day.

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
fine to feel upset

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.310 align:middle line:84%
on the anniversary of this
cataclysmic event that

00:58:33.310 --> 00:58:34.670 align:middle line:90%
happens in your life.

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
about asking for help

00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and being OK with not being
this super happy, positive,

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.970 align:middle line:84%
energetic person
all of the time.

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's also allowing yourself
to sit in those feelings

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and feel like shit and feel
angry and feel sad and not

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:56.410 align:middle line:90%
try and pump yourself up again.

00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:59.117 align:middle line:90%
That would be my advice.

00:58:59.117 --> 00:59:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I do have one question
that's come out of that.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.173 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people that have
gone through very traumatic

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:06.330 align:middle line:84%
events are
traumatized by things.

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:11.490 align:middle line:84%
They have phobias about things,
like about fire or about snakes

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:12.540 align:middle line:90%
or about this.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:14.957 align:middle line:84%
Did you have any
phobias or traumas?

00:59:14.957 --> 00:59:16.290 align:middle line:90%
And did you have any techniques?

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Did you use tapping or did
you use things that helped you

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:19.140 align:middle line:90%
get through?

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So I did tapping
with my psychologist.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And then if a candle was lit
in the room, I'd freak out.

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But then I thought,
do you really

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:36.210 align:middle line:84%
want to live your life
going to a barbecue

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:38.638 align:middle line:84%
and then flipping
out because you--

00:59:38.638 --> 00:59:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't say flipping
out, because that sounds

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.400 align:middle line:90%
like I'm being dismissive.

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:48.750 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want to live my
life that when I smelled smoke

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:51.360 align:middle line:84%
or if I saw a flame, that
I would be immediately

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.710 align:middle line:90%
transported back to that day.

00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:55.830 align:middle line:90%
So I started really small.

00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:59.370 align:middle line:90%
I'd have a candle in the room.

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:01.067 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't like it.

01:00:01.067 --> 01:00:02.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be in the room.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.675 align:middle line:84%
But I would say to
myself, well, just

01:00:05.675 --> 01:00:07.050 align:middle line:84%
be in this room
for five minutes.

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Just see how you go.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:08.777 align:middle line:90%
Just see how it feels.

01:00:08.777 --> 01:00:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's not
like I went from going

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%
through this tragic
event, then being face

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.130 align:middle line:90%
to face with a wall of flames.

01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I did it really small and really
consistently and just took

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:22.860 align:middle line:84%
these really small,
incremental steps.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So sitting in a room with a
candle, going to a barbecue,

01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:27.852 align:middle line:90%
smelling smoke--

01:00:27.852 --> 01:00:30.060 align:middle line:84%
being uncomfortable and
saying to yourself, of course

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.710 align:middle line:90%
you're uncomfortable.

01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:32.760 align:middle line:90%
You've been burned.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Of course you're
going to feel weird.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.360 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a normal human response.

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:42.735 align:middle line:84%
But what's funny is I went to
one of Tony Robbins's events.

01:00:42.735 --> 01:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I've opened for
Tony Robbins now.

01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
But before that, years ago,
I went to one of his events.

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And on the first
day, I found out

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:53.340 align:middle line:84%
we were going to do this
fire walk, where they

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.820 align:middle line:84%
get this pit of burning hot
coals at around 500 degrees

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Celsius.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And the aim of the
game is to walk across

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.220 align:middle line:90%
without hurting yourself.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And I heard that and I thought,
I didn't sign up for this.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So I got out of my seat, and
I tried to leave the room.

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:10.560 align:middle line:84%
But then there was one of
Tony's team guarding the door.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And they said to me,
Tony knows who you are.

01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Tony wants you to
do the fire walk.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, you can go tell
your mate Tony to get fucked.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing it.

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I was really adamant
that I wasn't doing it.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And they said, oh, OK.

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
But don't feel like
you have to leave.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.470 align:middle line:90%
So I sat back down.

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
to think about it

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.220 align:middle line:90%
a little more carefully.

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
maybe with each step

01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I take over those
burning hot coals,

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm walking further away
from my biggest tragedy

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and closer towards
my biggest triumph.

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up doing
the fire walk.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And Tony had hyped it up
so much during the day,

01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
so I was expecting this
100-meter line of burning

01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:52.110 align:middle line:90%
hot coals.

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:54.420 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't that big.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It was like the size of
that little mat there.

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not traumatized
by what happened to me.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.530 align:middle line:84%
But if I see smoke,
if I smell fire,

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:09.420 align:middle line:84%
then it's a natural
response for me

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.540 align:middle line:84%
to be transported
back to that day.

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But I've had enough
practice now at listening

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:19.260 align:middle line:84%
to that voice inside my head,
that voice that talks to me.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.353 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
dismissive of me.

01:02:21.353 --> 01:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
They talk to me
like I'm a friend.

01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:25.838 align:middle line:90%
They say, it's OK.

01:02:25.838 --> 01:02:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course you're going
to be a bit worried.

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
It's fine, but it's
only a barbecue.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Nothing bad's going to happen.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell me specifically
about your experience with EFT

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.270 align:middle line:10%
and tapping, because we've
interviewed quite a lot

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:41.250 align:middle line:10%
of leading experts on
this who are going deeper

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:41.850 align:middle line:10%
into the science.

01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that
you'd used this technique.

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So can you tell me about
when you first came across it,

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
how it was presented to you, and
some of the exercises that you

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.220 align:middle line:90%
did?

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I guess I probably don't feel
like I'm in a great position

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:54.550 align:middle line:90%
to really--

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Just your
personal experience--

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Explain.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.785 align:middle line:84%
But basically, I just talked
through my experience.

01:03:01.785 --> 01:03:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So again, I can tell
you what happened to me.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:07.660 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not traumatized by it.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not re-inflicting
trauma on me.

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
But basically, I talked to
my psychologist about it.

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:16.660 align:middle line:90%
And she just tapped on me.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And we did that.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.940 align:middle line:84%
We might have even
done that 20 times.

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And she described it to like
when you see a scary movie,

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:27.130 align:middle line:90%
you're terrified.

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And then if you watch
it again the next day,

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.770 align:middle line:90%
you're still scared.

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens if
you watch it 10 times, then

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.450 align:middle line:90%
100 times, and then 1,000 times?

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.062 align:middle line:84%
You still know where
the scary bits are,

01:03:39.062 --> 01:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're still
anticipating them.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And you still know that
you're going to be a bit--

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:45.723 align:middle line:90%
you don't like them.

01:03:45.723 --> 01:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But you're not
going to freak out.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And you can stay there,
and you can watch it

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.440 align:middle line:90%
until the end of the movie.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:52.877 align:middle line:84%
That's how she
described it to me.

01:03:52.877 --> 01:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And I really liked
that description.

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So now, if I'm recounting
the fire or anything,

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't love it.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't relish it.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
I know it's going to be
uncomfortable, but I can do it.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And would she tap on
certain parts of your face?

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:10.710 align:middle line:90%
>> She would just tap on my leg.

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And she'd tap as she talked
you through this process.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> She'd tap, and I would
tell her my experience.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And that helped you to
calm your phobia around this.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And when she described it
to me, I was like, really?

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
You're just going to tap
on me while I tell you

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:33.230 align:middle line:84%
about this really
traumatic day that I had?

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:35.110 align:middle line:90%
So I think it was the tapping.

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
But I also think it was
when she explained it

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
to me like watching a scary
movie, that made sense to me.

01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, yeah, I want to
watch this movie 100,000 times

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.390 align:middle line:84%
so that the intensity of
the emotion is diminished.

01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:53.482 align:middle line:84%
I had it described to me by
a gentleman, Dawson Church,

01:04:53.482 --> 01:04:54.940 align:middle line:90%
the other month in the US.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.120 align:middle line:84%
He's an expert in tapping,
maybe even trained this lady.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.475 align:middle line:84%
But basically, as a mammal, if
we see something or experience

01:05:02.475 --> 01:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
something traumatic, when
we relive it in our mind,

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.395 align:middle line:90%
the same trauma happens.

01:05:05.395 --> 01:05:06.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:06.195 --> 01:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> However, if you touch
your body or tap your body

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:11.830 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, as a mammal
or as a dog, for instance,

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:15.640 align:middle line:84%
touch overrides fear because
you can't be stroking yourself

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.713 align:middle line:84%
and calming yourself in
a fire or in a trauma.

01:05:18.713 --> 01:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know that.

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:20.922 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that explanation.

01:05:20.922 --> 01:05:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when he explained
this, it made complete sense.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you recount the
situation, it's traumatic.

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you touch
or tap the body,

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
the body takes
the tapping signal

01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and overrides it as
a sense of safety.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know that.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So then it rewires your brain
to say that that situation is

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:39.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know that.

01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, that made all
the sense in the world.

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.617 align:middle line:90%
So while you're recounting--

01:05:45.617 --> 01:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Because she told
me, and I didn't--

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
this is bullshit.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But then when she did
it, I did feel calmer.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
keep recounting it.

01:05:56.730 --> 01:05:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.760 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>> So maybe that worked for you.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it did.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, obviously.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.707 align:middle line:90%
>> So we're done here.

01:06:07.707 --> 01:06:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for your time.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I do want to ask you
one last question.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
you think we've missed?

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's kind of sad.

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So that gentleman who
took a few seconds

01:06:19.110 --> 01:06:21.900 align:middle line:84%
to reassure me in that fire,
he was there with his son.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
He was competing with
his son in this race.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:27.480 align:middle line:84%
They were a father-son
duo from South Africa.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And then two years later,
I got an email from the son

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.273 align:middle line:90%
to say his dad had passed away.

01:06:33.273 --> 01:06:34.440 align:middle line:90%
And his dad had passed away.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.580 align:middle line:84%
He was training for
another adventure race,

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.600 align:middle line:90%
and he'd been hit by a truck.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:43.200 align:middle line:84%
But for me, when I found
that out, I just thought,

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
going through this experience
that I've been through,

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make me immune
to further tragedy.

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Life's unknown, life's random,
and life's not guaranteed.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that
reinforced my belief

01:06:57.090 --> 01:07:00.365 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
make the most of it

01:07:00.365 --> 01:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
because we don't really
know how much of it we get.

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:05.510 align:middle line:90%


01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:08.460 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, that was sad about--

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Wise words.

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Turia.

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.365 align:middle line:84%
It's been incredible
speaking with you.
