[GENTLE MUSIC]

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.627 align:middle line:10%
It's James here
from Food Matters.

00:00:09.627 --> 00:00:14.030 align:middle line:10%
And welcome to this special
interview with Dawson Church.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:10%
Dawson is a character
who is bigger than life.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.450 align:middle line:90%
He has a PhD.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.460 align:middle line:84%
He's a multiple
bestselling author,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:84%
including the books
"Genie in your Genes"

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:90%
and "Mind to Matter."

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
going to be talking

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
about how your thoughts and
your emotions and your feelings

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:84%
literally become your reality
and the gross impact that

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
can have on your life, both
positively and negatively

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:90%
and what you can do about it.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Dawson, hello.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Great to be here, James.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So you have a unique
viewpoint when it

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:90%
comes to emotions and thoughts.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.022 align:middle line:84%
What are they specifically,
in your opinion?

00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when we say,
thought or emotion,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
we think of something
insubstantial, intangible.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet, our
thoughts and emotions

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:84%
are driving changes
in our bodies,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
changes in the world around
us every single moment

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:90%
with every single thought.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Just like, for example,
inside our bodies.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:84%
We have the stress hormones
like adrenaline and cortisol.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
If I have you think about
a stressful thought,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:84%
think about anything
that stresses you out,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
if you have a rise
in emotion, you're

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.292 align:middle line:84%
literally creating
those molecules,

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:84%
those stress hormones
in your body.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're not doing
it in half an hour,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:84%
an hour of that
negative thought.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
You're thinking and
doing those things

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and you're creating those
molecules within seconds

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.600 align:middle line:90%
of having that thought.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So in that way,
every single thought

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
we have, positive or negative,
is producing biological shifts

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:90%
inside our bodies.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And with these thoughts--

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and can you decouple
this sort of relationship

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that I'm struggling with,
which is like thought, belief,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.587 align:middle line:90%
or emotion?

00:01:49.587 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:84%
What are the difference
between those?

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.212 align:middle line:90%
Or are they all the same?

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Or what comes first?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
That's a good question,
thought, belief, and emotion,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.752 align:middle line:84%
because what is a
thought, what is

00:01:58.752 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:90%
a belief, what is an emotion?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And how do they
relate to each other?

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:84%
The way I would conceptualize it
is that thoughts are transient.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:90%
But beliefs are long term.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And a belief is a
pattern of thought.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So you might have
a fleeting thought.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you think that
thought over and over

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and over again-- just
say, for example,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
a thought of
self-criticism or something

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
you don't like about
the world or blame

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
you have towards somebody
else or a big system

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
like a government
or a corporation,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.500 align:middle line:84%
all of those thoughts, if
you hold them consistently,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
can solidify into fixed
beliefs and worldview.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And so, for example,
you might initially

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
have the sense are things
not being good in your life,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.475 align:middle line:90%
may have adverse experiences.

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And then that may
develop into a belief

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
that the world is
an unsafe place.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Now you're driving high
cortisol, high adrenaline.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.120 align:middle line:84%
You're triggering
gene expression

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and a whole cascade
of biological events

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.930 align:middle line:90%
with that belief.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.492 align:middle line:84%
If you then add emotion
and believe that strongly,

00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
when you're passionate
about your belief,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.340 align:middle line:84%
now you're adding
fuel to the fire.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.648 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you'll see a
big increase in gene expression,

00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
big increase in
those stress hormones

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:90%
like adrenaline and cortisol.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And emotion is adding
fuel to that process.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
A thought held lightly doesn't
have a lot of biological impact

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:90%
on your body.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But a thought that is
backed by strong emotion

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:84%
can have a huge
effect on your body.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Now over time, this produces
big, adverse effects

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:90%
on the body.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And that thought
is a transient one.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So I had this
negative thought, you

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
might see a very
small shift and gene

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
expression and a small
rise in stress hormones.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you think that
thought persistently,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
day after day after day, if it's
a belief, becomes a world view,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:90%
and you have emotion with it.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Now you're raising
your cortisol level

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.740 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So high cortisol over time leads
to reduced muscle mass, reduced

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
bone density, increased
skin wrinkling,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:90%
degradation of digestion.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
All of these things start
to be affected negatively

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
by those thoughts
held for a long time.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:84%
People under high stress
or high cortisol--

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
eventually, cortisol
literally begins

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
to calcify the memory and
learning centers in your brain.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Your hippocampus can get
calcium deposits on it

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:84%
if you have high
cortisol over time.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Now you want calcium
in your bones and teeth

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:90%
and places like that.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.330 align:middle line:84%
You do not want calcium
forming in your hippocampus,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:90%
your memory learning center.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what happens
in stressed people over time.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So now your mind, your
consciousness fueled by emotion

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:84%
is producing substantial
changes in your brain.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The software of mind is turning
into the hardware of brain.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And now you have a different
brain affected by stress.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you meditate,
if you do EFT tapping,

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.273 align:middle line:84%
if you spend time in nature,
if you're in your heart,

00:04:49.273 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
if you spend time
with loved ones,

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:84%
you have rich social
networks, all of these things

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:90%
go into reverse.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Now you're not making
lots of cortisol.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:84%
You make lots of DHEA and
other positive hormones.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And DHEA is also called
the youthening hormone.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So now with high levels of
DHEA, all those aging signs,

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
all those things
go into reverse.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
A happy person has high
DHEA, high oxytocin.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin then sparks
the production

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
of neurochemicals like
anandamide, the bliss molecule,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, like
nitric oxide which

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:90%
makes you alert in your life.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
All these positive
things happen when

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
you are a positive thinker,
when you meditate, when you tap,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
when you do all these
practices that center you

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and give you a positive
affect mood outlook.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So now thought, consciousness
fueled by positive emotion

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.675 align:middle line:90%
is becoming vibrant health.

00:05:39.675 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's the direction
you want to nudge yourself

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:90%
in with every thought.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:84%
People think their
thoughts are innocuous.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
insubstantial.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.567 align:middle line:84%
But they're affecting your
body every single moment.

00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:52.192 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was working on
my book, "Genie in Your Genes"

00:05:52.192 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was getting knee deep into
this research many years ago,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:90%
reading these studies.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
One day, I was reading
a scientific paper.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.690 align:middle line:90%
And my kids were teenagers then.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And I ran out of my office,
waving a paper by my head,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:90%
brandishing this.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I said to my son,
I said, "Lionel,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:84%
if you'd read this, if
you knew what I know now,

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:84%
you would never have a
single negative thought

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:90%
in your entire life."

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And really, if you knew the
harm it did to your body,

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
you would do your utmost to
quit that negative thinking

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And yet we don't.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It's dizzying to think.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we just
spoke before we started

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
this conversation
was about how much

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:84%
we allow ourselves to be
conditioned by our environment.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
What are the dangers
of allowing ourselves

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
to be overrun with thoughts and
emotions from our environment

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and not really
controlling them, per se?

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the depressing
statistics is how many people

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.160 align:middle line:84%
check their phones first
thing in the morning.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
They wake up and they look at
their social media accounts.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They check email first
thing in the morning.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's over half the people,
in some surveys about 2/3

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:90%
of people do this.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
There are studies showing that
some people check their cell

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.882 align:middle line:84%
phones during
sexual intercourse.

00:07:18.882 --> 00:07:23.035 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:07:23.035 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:90%
This is an addiction.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.620 align:middle line:90%
That's addictive behavior.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
We're addicted to stuff and
very little of it is positive.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're filling our minds with
negative news, negative inputs.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.360 align:middle line:84%
We're not taking
control of our health.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
We're handing
control of our health

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and our thoughts and our
beliefs to other people

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:90%
outside of ourselves.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're handing our thoughts
and control of our beliefs

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
over to people who just want to
make a buck off negative news.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So one study, for example,
looked at the world.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And it compared the world
to news about the world.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Now if you look at
actual objective measures

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:84%
of human flourishing,
they're fantastic.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
In the last 33 years,
human global wealth

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.680 align:middle line:84%
for the average
citizen has tripled.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Over the last century, the
human lifespan has, on average,

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
doubled.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:84%
We now have about half the
CO2 production per unit of GDP

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:90%
we had 20 years ago.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:84%
If you look at human rights, if
you look at infant mortality,

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
virtually every
measure of flourishing

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.080 align:middle line:90%
shows we're improving.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Globally, IQ is rising by about
three points every decade.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you just look
at all the statistics,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.190 align:middle line:84%
everything points to us
being an unprecedented era

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.270 align:middle line:90%
of human flourishing.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
Now what's happening in
the media is the opposite.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
One team of scientists did
a word analysis of words

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:90%
in the New York Times.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.105 align:middle line:84%
They did from 1945
to the present.

00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have
records going back that long

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:90%
with the New York Times.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And they found that over the
years, the number of words

00:08:53.850 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
like good and positive,
happy, all of those words

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.460 align:middle line:90%
were in steady decline.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And words like horrific
and tragic and violent,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
all these negative
words were going up.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Even as the actual state of the
world is in improving steadily,

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
our perception of it, as
portrayed by the media,

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:90%
is getting worse.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that same team,
they looked at word analysis

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.277 align:middle line:84%
from 130 countries, all
their media since 1975.

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:90%
And they found the same pattern.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.110 align:middle line:84%
All over the world,
we're being told

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
things are worse
and worse and worse

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.735 align:middle line:84%
while they're getting better
and better and better.

00:09:31.735 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens when
we wake up in the morning

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and we then hand our
conscience over to Facebook

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and Google and Instagram and
all these external sources?

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
We're then saying, you've got
to program my mind for me.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting a completely
inaccurate view of the world

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:90%
by doing that.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.135 align:middle line:84%
What I recommend
you do instead--

00:09:52.135 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:84%
what I do every morning is,
I wake up in the morning.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I
attune to what I call

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:90%
in my books non-local mind.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:90%
We have our consciousness.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But our consciousness is not
the artifact of a complex brain.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Our brain is more
like a transceiver

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
of information from
non-local fields

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and a translator of that
information into local reality.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:84%
We literally make up
local reality around us

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:90%
with our brains.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you wake up in the
morning and you, of course,

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:84%
have a local mind,
you have a local body.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But if you immediately
attune it to non-local mind,

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
non-local reality, then
the news you're getting

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:90%
is the news of the universe.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And it is positive.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It is full of abundance and
love and compassion and joy.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So now, you're plugging
yourself into all of that.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:84%
You aren't plugging yourself
into all the negative media,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:84%
the negative inputs and
filling your mind with that.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:90%
You're plugging into reality.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:84%
That stuff out there
is not reality.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.220 align:middle line:90%
This stuff up here is reality.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:84%
The mystics, the saints,
the sages throughout history

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
have told us that you lose
yourself in an ocean of bliss

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:90%
when you're there.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Now what starts
happening in your body

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:84%
then is not high cortisol,
is not high adrenaline.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.030 align:middle line:90%
It's high DHEA.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:90%
It's high oxytocin.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It's high anandamide,
the bliss molecule.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:90%
It is nitric oxide.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
It is norepinephrine,
which helps you stay alert.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
All these beneficial
shifts happen in your body.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Your brain secretes
beta endorphins.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So you begin a
meditation practice.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Beta endorphins are the
natural form of morphine.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
They are three
times more powerful

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.785 align:middle line:90%
than synthetic morphine.

00:11:27.785 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So now you see, you start
your meditation practice.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.560 align:middle line:84%
You feel a bit of
ache in your back.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.603 align:middle line:90%
Your tummy's rumbling.

00:11:32.603 --> 00:11:34.020 align:middle line:84%
If you feel a
little bit of a neck

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:84%
ache from exercising
too much yesterday.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, you're in bliss.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
You've forgotten
about your body.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
That's beta
endorphin kicking in.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
So you now have all
these beneficial hormones

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and neurotransmitters kicking
in because you plugged yourself

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:84%
into the information source
of the universe, which

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
has nothing but love for you and
love for everything around you.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you want
to start your day.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.527 align:middle line:84%
And those are the beneficial
biological changes

00:11:57.527 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:84%
you want to be
producing in your body,

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
not all these negative
ones that come

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
from plugging in to
the outside world

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
to these thoughts and ideas
and worldviews and stories that

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.690 align:middle line:90%
come from the news.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that goes a
long way to describing

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
in a scientific way,
what happens when people

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:90%
have a spiritual experience.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.655 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk a little bit more
on your "Genie in Your Genes"

00:12:22.655 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:84%
work, because I
thought that was really

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:84%
foundational in
helping us understand

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.340 align:middle line:90%
the power of epigenetics.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we have bought into
this idea that we are victims,

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:90%
we're victims to our genes.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And that if we get
something, well, that's

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
because my mom had it
and my mom's had it.

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's simply not
true with the research

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that you're helping
bring to prominence.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:84%
What is the study
of epigenetics?

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And how can we understand
it more deeply in order

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:90%
to re-empower ourselves?

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So epigenetics is changes in
genes triggered by factors that

00:12:55.510 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:84%
come from outside the genome
and often, outside the body.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And a simple
example is that, say

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
you're walking through
the park one day.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful summer's day.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling wonderful.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And then a pitbull breaks
loose of its owner,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.760 align:middle line:84%
rushes over to you with
fangs open, mouth open,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
fangs dripping with saliva,
just barking furiously at you,

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
running into you.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, your whole day shifts.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
You then move into
fight or flight

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to react to
this threat from the outside.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So your body is translating
this external stimulus

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:84%
of the pitbull into internal
biochemical molecular

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.722 align:middle line:90%
messengers.

00:13:36.722 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And those are going
throughout your whole body.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're pushing
you into stress, not

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.900 align:middle line:90%
in 20 seconds or five minutes.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.190 align:middle line:90%
That's too late.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Those genes reach
peak expression

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:90%
in under three seconds.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So now your body's
flooded with adrenaline,

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
flooded with cortisol
very, very quickly.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're then
responding to that threat.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So that's how this
works epigenetically

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
and how an external stimulus can
produce an internal response.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the way the stress
response is meant to work.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors survived
because they had a hair

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:90%
trigger stress response.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And in any tribe, any ancient
tribe 100,000 years ago,

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:84%
500,000 years ago, those people
with the best stress response,

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:84%
with the best ability to turn
those genes on in a flash

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and make lots of adrenaline,
those people lived.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
The happy people
like you or me ?

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.383 align:middle line:84%
The Vikings marauded
and they died

00:14:29.383 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't have
that quick stress response.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.890 align:middle line:84%
The meditators, you
know, they were just

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.015 align:middle line:84%
sitting there in the cave
and they got slaughtered.

00:14:35.015 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So we've been bred
now for millennia

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:84%
to have a lightning fast stress
response, which was perfect

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:84%
when there were tigers and
mastodons and all kinds

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.880 align:middle line:90%
of predators around us.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Now the worst
predator we have is

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:90%
our thinking, our own thoughts.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:90%
So now I go back home.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The pitbull event
is five hours old.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get injured,
nothing bad happened.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling the story to
my child and I'm getting upset.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I can feel my
heart racing faster

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:90%
as I think about the pitbull.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:90%
My face is flushing.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I am having the
same stress response

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
in response to my own
thinking and emotion

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:90%
as I had to the pitbull.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, if we do
that over and over

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and over again, if we retell the
sad, tragic story of our past,

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
if we stay stuck
in our childhood

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
traumas and the unresolved
issues of our past,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:84%
if we remain there over
and over and over again,

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
it has a terrible
effect on our bodies.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the studies in my
book, "Mind to Matter"

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
compares the lifespan of
optimists versus pessimists.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:84%
People who have a cheery and
positive frame for their lives,

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.150 align:middle line:84%
they have all the same
problems as other people.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:90%
They may have been fired a job.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
They may have had
a financial crash.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
They may have had all
kinds of personal problems.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But they have an optimistic
take on the world.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.870 align:middle line:84%
It compares their
lifespan to pessimists.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And the difference in lifespan
is eight years, eight years.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Those optimists live eight
years longer than pessimists.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And those aren't
eight years spent

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
on a respirator
in a nursing home.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Those are eight
healthy years as well.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So just think about
that for a moment.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Just the way you hold things
may not be that apparent to you

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:90%
when you're 20 or 30.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.115 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
40 and 50 and 60,

00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:29.490 align:middle line:84%
you start thinking
very seriously

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:84%
about those last eight years
and the quality of life

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:90%
you have in those eight years.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
radically shifted

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.640 align:middle line:84%
by your thoughts and
your emotions right now.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That's easy to say for
someone who is inherently

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
optimistic or grew up in a nice
household with a comfortable

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But what about someone
who was abused?

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:84%
What about somebody who had
sexual abuse as a child?

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:84%
What about somebody who
was beaten as a child?

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:84%
What about somebody who
was neglected or abandoned

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and not loved and is
now out in the world,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
playing out the way
that they're responding

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:90%
to that in adulthood?

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:84%
How can they become
aware of these emotions?

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:90%
And what can they do about them?

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two
kinds of trauma.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
There is simple trauma and
there's complex trauma.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And complex trauma is
usually developmental trauma.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So an example of
simple trauma is,

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
somebody who's 25 years old,
they have a terrible car crash.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're in the
hospital for a long time.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It takes them a
great many months

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:90%
to regain physical function.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And this shatters their lives
in some fundamental way.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:90%
That's a simple trauma.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:84%
A complex trauma is one
where there was abuse,

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:90%
often as a child.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.647 align:middle line:84%
And if there's
developmental trauma

00:17:40.647 --> 00:17:42.730 align:middle line:84%
where you were beaten over
and over and over again

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.490 align:middle line:84%
or whether you were being
neglected, whether you were

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
being raped, whether you were
being physically assaulted,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.348 align:middle line:90%
and it was repeated.

00:17:49.348 --> 00:17:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a different
kind of trauma

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:84%
because the brain is growing
while that trauma is happening.

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And that information is
being installed at the level

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:90%
of circuits in your brain.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a thought
or a belief or one event.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It is crucial, it is
fundamental to the actual way

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:90%
your brain wired together.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
For the first two years of life,
the fastest growing rate brain

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:90%
region is the limbic system.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So the limbic system,
the emotional midbrain

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:84%
is the fastest
growing brain region.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not a part of the
brain that has language.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:84%
That's Broca's area over
here behind our temple.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the language part.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.545 align:middle line:84%
This is the center of our
brain, the emotional midbrain,

00:18:29.545 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that's the fastest
growing part of our brain.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
It has no language but it
feels and feels deeply.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
being traumatized

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
while that part of
your brain is growing,

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
then trauma is woven into
the neural fabric of the way

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.800 align:middle line:90%
your brain structure is.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
trauma is hard to treat.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.510 align:middle line:84%
We find in trauma
treatment manuals

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
and approaches that simple
trauma is relatively easy,

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
but developmental
trauma, complex trauma

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:90%
is hard to treat.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So how does that
person get through it?

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And you can't easily get through
it using cognitive techniques,

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:84%
using thought or
language based therapies.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I can't sit you in
a chair and say,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.110 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't feel
that way, because it's

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
fundamental to the way
your brain functions.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
So for example, there
was a famous psychiatrist

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
called Joseph Wolpe.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:84%
After World War
II, he was working

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:90%
with veterans of World War II.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And these men, for the most
part men, had shell shock.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.368 align:middle line:84%
They were dreadfully
affected by the war.

00:19:32.368 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was a good
Freudian therapist.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So he laid them on the couch to
do the talking cure and said,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
tell me about Omaha Beach.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote in
one of his books,

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:84%
he said, he came
to the realization

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.010 align:middle line:84%
after doing this with
those soldiers, he said,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that kind of therapy
is not ineffective.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:90%
It's harmful.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And a later term, it's
re-traumatizing to remember

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
the bad stuff, to remember
the pitbull attack,

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.128 align:middle line:84%
remember the car
accident, remember

00:20:02.128 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
your buddies was being
blown to bits on the beach.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:09.820 align:middle line:84%
By replaying that in your mind,
that thought, now stimulating

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that emotion is actually
re-traumatizing you.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you fire those neural
circuits in your brain,

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
they wire together bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So we find, for example,
that stress circuits

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:84%
like the amygdala grow
in people who have

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.980 align:middle line:90%
been traumatized in that way.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And learning and memory circuits
like those in the hippocampus

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:90%
actually shrink over time.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing brain
remodeling with our thoughts.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Our thought aren't just
producing some kind of emotion

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:90%
or experience in our minds.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.687 align:middle line:84%
They're producing neural
tissue in our brains.

00:20:44.687 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you start to use that
neural tissue over and over

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.270 align:middle line:84%
again, then it becomes
hard to change.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can't use
cognitive techniques

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
for development trauma
or preverbal trauma.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:90%
You need energy techniques.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.995 align:middle line:84%
And we have huge
numbers of them.

00:20:56.995 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
We have acupuncture which
affects the flows of energy

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:90%
in the body's meridians.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
We have acupressure
like EFT where

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:84%
you interrupt that thought and
that experience with pressure

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:90%
or tapping on a point.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:84%
With energy medicine, energy
psychology techniques.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And these work below
the level of thought.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:84%
They work at the level of
the body's energy system.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
What we see, for
example, on MRI or EEG

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:84%
scans is massive shifts in
the body's usage of energy.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.270 align:middle line:84%
As you shift the energy of the
body, then the form of the body

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.230 align:middle line:90%
shifts as well.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Profound because these are
the type of techniques that

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:84%
generally incite a lot
of skepticism in people.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I love your
work because you're

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:90%
bringing deep science to this.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's zero in on EFT or
tapping for a little bit.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And in your opinion, is this
one of the most effective

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
techniques people can learn to
use in order to, not only just

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%
calm the body and the mind, but
get through things like trauma

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
or phobia or complex
trauma, like you said?

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.430 align:middle line:84%
>> EFT is a very
simple technique.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
It has you think about
something that bothers you.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Now when you think about
a thing that bothers you,

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.810 align:middle line:84%
you're activating all the
circuits in your brain

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:90%
that carry that information.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So you then have your brain
working in a certain way.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.480 align:middle line:84%
You have certain
circuits lit up.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
things that bother you

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
over and over and
over again, you

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:84%
make those circuits bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But if you interrupt that
pattern with something else,

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.230 align:middle line:84%
then you are able to
break that signaling.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And then your brain no
longer uses that circuit.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And the something else, in the
case of EFT, is acupressure.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.830 align:middle line:84%
There are over 300 meridian
points of the body.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:84%
They're organized into
14 meridian lines.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And EFT has you apply
acupressure in the form

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of fingertip tapping like this
to about 13 of those points.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:84%
There are seven in the
brief form of EFT and 13

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
in the long form of EFT, as
well as using eye movements.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And what you see in
people's EEGs and MRIs when

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.365 align:middle line:84%
they do this is
that, your first have

00:23:04.365 --> 00:23:05.743 align:middle line:90%
them think about the problem.

00:23:05.743 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
When they think
about the problem,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
about the event in their
life, about the bomb blast,

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:84%
about the car crash, about
the terrible divorce,

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
whatever it might be, you find
the emotional brain is all

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.750 align:middle line:90%
lit up in an MRI or in an EEG.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.890 align:middle line:84%
You see all this activity
in the emotional midbrain.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:84%
When people start tapping,
it sends a second signal

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:90%
to the brain of safety.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're being
chased by a tiger,

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.736 align:middle line:90%
you would not be tapping.

00:23:30.736 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] So now, the
brain's getting two inputs.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It's getting this signal
from your memory saying,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.640 align:middle line:84%
be stressed, be
stressed, be stressed.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Danger, danger, danger, danger.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And so your second signal,
a somatic signal of soothing

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:90%
in the form of tapping.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And it prioritizes that soothing
signal, just the way your mom,

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
when you're crying,
hopefully as a baby,

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:90%
she would stroke your face.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.540 align:middle line:90%
She would stroke your head.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%
She would touch you.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Touch is a fundamental safety
signal that we as animals,

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:90%
as mammals understand.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:90%
Every animal understands touch.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So say your dog, every time
it sees a car coming by,

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
it just starts
barking and goes crazy

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.745 align:middle line:90%
and gets really wildly excited.

00:24:18.745 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Goes into fight
or flight itself.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Runs after the car.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And you want to
calm the dog down.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
You can explain to the
dog really logically

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.050 align:middle line:84%
why running after cars
is such a bad idea

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and is likely to lead
to the dog's demise.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can get really
super clear with the dog,

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and paint her a great
word picture of why

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:90%
the dog shouldn't do that.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't going to work.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you stroke the dog,
that will calm the dog.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.285 align:middle line:84%
So the dog understands
touch in a way which

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't understand language.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with us.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Our emotional midbrains
understand touch.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.665 align:middle line:84%
When a friend of
yours is crying,

00:24:56.665 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
explain to them

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.350 align:middle line:90%
why they shouldn't feel so bad.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
You put your arm around them
and touch will soothe them.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.140 align:middle line:90%
So EFT is stroke you and a dog.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
It calms the emotional midbrain.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's really amazing.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
On MRI scans, we have
people imagine a trauma.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.530 align:middle line:84%
There midbrain gets
all lit up in the MRI.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.950 align:middle line:90%
We have them tap.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.768 align:middle line:90%
It just shuts down.

00:25:22.768 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
One thing you didn't describe
was, what does EFT stand for?

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And is there a difference
between EFT and tapping,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.880 align:middle line:84%
or that's all the
same sort of thing?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>> EFT stands for emotional
freedom techniques.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It's also called tapping because
you tap on acupressure points

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:84%
while you're thinking
about a negative problem

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:90%
or event in your life.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:90%
There is a big difference.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:84%
You need to make
sure you use what

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:84%
we call clinical EFT, which
is a form of EFT validated

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:90%
in over 100 clinical trials.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not a
trademark term or practice.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.072 align:middle line:84%
So there are people who
say, I'm an EMT practitioner

00:25:58.072 --> 00:25:59.530 align:middle line:84%
but all they've
done is read a book

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:01.150 align:middle line:90%
or watched a YouTube video.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So that'll get you somewhere,
the basic forms of EFT.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But to really unlock
the full power of EFT,

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.240 align:middle line:84%
you need trained practitioners
to work with you.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.595 align:middle line:90%
So how can people identify--

00:26:18.595 --> 00:26:20.220 align:middle line:84%
because we've spoken
to a lot of people

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
about this idea of
limiting beliefs,

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.390 align:middle line:84%
which really translate
into limiting thoughts

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.350 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves in our lives.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
But people might sit
there and they go--

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
they might they might
take stock of their life.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, I've got this.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.803 align:middle line:84%
I've been diagnosed
with this illness

00:26:33.803 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and I've got this
financial travel

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'm on my second
marriage and on this.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have any
limiting beliefs.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you speak to them,
that's abstract to them.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
They're like, well, what
is a limiting belief

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:90%
and how does that work?

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:46.007 align:middle line:84%
So how can people
identify if they

00:26:46.007 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:84%
might have limiting beliefs
or thoughts about themselves

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.380 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how it could
be impacting their lives?

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Listen to yourself talk.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of
phrases people pick up

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
from their family, from their
tribe, things like, I'm waiting

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.900 align:middle line:90%
for the other shoe to drop.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Things like, you're
over the hill.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Things like, money
doesn't grow on trees.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:90%
All the men are taken.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
These are all beliefs
people have and they come up

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.810 align:middle line:84%
in our language and
our cliches we use.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:90%
So those tend to be our beliefs.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:90%
And we express them often.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Often they're below the
level of conscious thought

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:90%
and we believe they're true.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.795 align:middle line:90%
But they aren't true.

00:27:20.795 --> 00:27:22.103 align:middle line:90%
All of the men aren't taken.

00:27:22.103 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Money actually
does grow on trees,

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
because we use paper
fabric to create it.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] So you
want to be in a space

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
of challenging those
beliefs when you hear them.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And so what things do you
say, what worldviews do you

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:90%
have that are true?

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Very little of what we
believe about the world

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:90%
actually is true.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's worth asking that
question, is it really,

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:90%
really true?

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's also
an interesting.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on a new book
now, called "This Brain,"

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.217 align:middle line:90%
on ecstatic mental states.

00:27:51.217 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Low states.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, low states.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And like, there are all kinds
of questions unanswered like,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.820 align:middle line:90%
how much meditation do you need?

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:00.930 align:middle line:90%
What is meditation?

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's no agreed
definition in EEG studies

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:90%
about what meditation even is.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you know what it
is, how do you measure it?

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:90%
How much do you need?

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.665 align:middle line:90%
How much is too much?

00:28:10.665 --> 00:28:11.723 align:middle line:90%
Is there too much?

00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:84%
What brain structures
are changed?

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And by how much meditation?

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:84%
So I love science
because this tells you,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.710 align:middle line:90%
it quantifies all this stuff.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not vague.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, double
the take for two hours

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.760 align:middle line:90%
because if you're in--

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I define meditation as
sustaining an alpha state

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:90%
for 15 seconds or more.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.090 align:middle line:84%
If you can sustain an alpha
state for 15 seconds or more,

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:90%
you in stable alpha.

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:84%
You have lots of
theta and delta.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
That triggers gamma
and shuts down beta.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a formula
that you can just

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.570 align:middle line:90%
train people to acquire.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And so initially, it takes me
in workshops about four minutes

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.940 align:middle line:90%
to train people to acquire that.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Untrained, it takes people about
30 to 40 minutes to acquire it.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.010 align:middle line:84%
If they're meditatives, they can
sit there for about 40 minutes

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.990 align:middle line:90%
and get there.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you do certain
just simple things,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:90%
you get there in four minutes.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.320 align:middle line:84%
With practice, you are
there in 90 seconds.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But only because
we have science.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.250 align:middle line:90%
And we're reverse engineering.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.530 align:middle line:84%
These Tibetan monks have been
doing this for 40,000 lifetime

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:09.330 align:middle line:90%
hours do.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We know what these
patterns look like?

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So I just love the
science behind all this.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what about some of the
more esoteric stories of like

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.697 align:middle line:84%
Milarepa and these people that
have meditated in these caves

00:29:18.697 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:90%
and they're able to move matter.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You see that hand
going through the cave.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.860 align:middle line:84%
What do you make of that
as a scientist, per se?

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:33.690 align:middle line:90%
So thoughts create things.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts obviously
create molecules,

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
like stress molecules
or well-being

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:90%
molecules inside our body.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But our thoughts create things
outside of our bodies, as well.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And there are four
fundamental forces in physics.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And those are
electromagnetism, gravity,

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.910 align:middle line:84%
the strong nuclear force
that holds charged particles

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:55.968 align:middle line:84%
together in the
center of an atom,

00:29:55.968 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and the weak nuclear force,
which is radioactive decay.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Those are the four
fundamental forces of physics.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's research or evidence
showing that consciousness,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:84%
the human mind, human beings,
our consciousness effects

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.690 align:middle line:90%
all four forces of physics.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:84%
There is a series of
studies of a Qigong master.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And when he's got a lump
of radioactive substance

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.210 align:middle line:84%
in front of him, they
asked him to speed up

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:22.625 align:middle line:90%
the radioactive decay.

00:30:22.625 --> 00:30:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, you shouldn't be able to
speed up radioactive decay.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Radioactive decay is the
basis of atomic clocks.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a cesium clock, one
of several used by scientists

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:32.963 align:middle line:90%
to measure time.

00:30:32.963 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Because in science, you
need super accurate measures

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:84%
This atomic clock is
accurate to one second

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:90%
in four million years.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:84%
That's how stable radioactive
decay is, or should be.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Until this Qigong master,
they tell him, speed it up

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and it speeds up by 10%.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.400 align:middle line:84%
They then say,
let's slow it down.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.560 align:middle line:90%
He slows it down by 9%.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And there are
several experiments

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
showing that people,
consciousness alone, just

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.760 align:middle line:84%
standing there looking at
a lump of radioactivity,

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.790 align:middle line:84%
can actually slow down
or speed up that process.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.190 align:middle line:84%
That's a remarkable
human ability.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:90%
Electromagnetism.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.485 align:middle line:84%
In one study, a healer
was working on mice

00:31:13.485 --> 00:31:15.150 align:middle line:90%
who were distant from him.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:18.820 align:middle line:84%
They were at a university
lab some distance away.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And his pager went
off at random times

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.940 align:middle line:84%
and told him to send healing
energy to those mice.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Now another part of the
university, in a different lab,

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.910 align:middle line:84%
there was another
set of control mice.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And he did not send energy
to those control mice.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Below the cages of
both sets of mice,

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.440 align:middle line:84%
there was a device that measured
the level of electromagnetism

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And so at random intervals,
again, just randomly,

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.450 align:middle line:84%
this healer is asked
to send healing

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to only one of those
two groups of mice.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And at that very moment,
that electrical field,

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that field in the room, changed
by over 20% only at the moments

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:84%
when he was sending healing
energy to those mice

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and only in the
experimental mice

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and not in the other
mice in the other lab.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So here, human beings
having over 20%

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:20.430 align:middle line:84%
affect on what should be a
completely impartial, stable

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.590 align:middle line:84%
law of physics,
electromagnetism.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And there are studies showing
that these facts are distant.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
They happen over
large distances.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:90%
They happen reliably.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:90%
You can replicate them.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So our consciousness
is literally

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:84%
changing matter
outside of our bodies.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Here I am drinking
a glass of water.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I drink about a
gallon of H2O a day.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Now water is a really
interesting substance.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies are 70% water.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.913 align:middle line:84%
But even the other
30% is largely

00:32:52.913 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:90%
a matter of water molecules.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.872 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies are over
90% water, actually,

00:32:55.872 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:90%
water molecules.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And research shows that when
people have a healing intention

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and place that healing
intention into water,

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.620 align:middle line:90%
the water begins to shift.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And water is, of course,
everyone knows, water is H2O.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.360 align:middle line:84%
We have one big oxygen molecule,
two little hydrogen molecules.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And the bonding angle,
the angle of that bond

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
between those three
molecules is 104 degrees.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.960 align:middle line:90%
That's always true.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Whether the water is in the
form of ice or steam or liquid,

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.720 align:middle line:84%
it's always at that same bonding
angle of 104 and 1/2 degrees,

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:90%
always.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:90%
Unless I bless the water.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.810 align:middle line:84%
When I bless the water, when
I send healing intentions

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:40.680 align:middle line:84%
to the water, that molecular
angle literally shrinks.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
If I take that water
that's been blessed

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and water plants with it and
water another batch of plants

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:84%
randomly with water that
hasn't been blessed,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:84%
the plants that are watered
with the blessed water

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.600 align:middle line:84%
grow faster, are stronger, and
have more chlorophyll in them

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:90%
than the unblessed ones.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So human consciousness
is literally

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:84%
able to shift the molecular
bonding angle of water.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And then when we use
that mode for things,

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.830 align:middle line:84%
then it produces
different effects

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in other living systems
and beings like plants.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So we are literally shifting
all these four forces,

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.719 align:middle line:84%
fundamental forces of
physics all around us

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.790 align:middle line:84%
all the time with
our consciousness.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we're
somewhat 90% water,

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:84%
isn't the thoughts that we
have about ourselves quite

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:90%
important?

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:29.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Vital.

00:34:29.148 --> 00:34:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you're shifting
the water inside of yourself

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.389 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's
making you healthy

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and happy or
unhealthy and unhappy.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.558 align:middle line:84%
That's why those
pessimists in that study

00:34:38.558 --> 00:34:40.350 align:middle line:84%
die eight years younger
than the optimists,

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.530 align:middle line:84%
because again, the
thought then correlates

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:47.850 align:middle line:84%
with shifts in their bodies
and with their lifespans.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We're taught that the
subconscious mind has

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.293 align:middle line:90%
an enormous power over us.

00:34:51.293 --> 00:34:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And you've explained
this earlier,

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.780 align:middle line:84%
how these emotions and
these thoughts and feelings

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.322 align:middle line:84%
get trapped in the
subconscious mind.

00:34:56.322 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And we've spoken about
energy medicine as well.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Where does hypnotherapy come
into this in your perspective?

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that
you've looked into?

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> In my books, I talk about
really important practices like

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.675 align:middle line:90%
EFT tapping, like meditation.

00:35:09.675 --> 00:35:10.800 align:middle line:90%
But there are many of them.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:90%
There's time in nature.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Time in nature is
incredibly important.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Grounding, earthing
is important.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Quality social relationships
are absolutely vital.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
relationship between people

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and how they affect
each other, it's

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.600 align:middle line:84%
clear that social relationships
play a huge role in health.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.670 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
practices like this.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is
not to say, this

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.290 align:middle line:84%
is the best practice or
the practice you need.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.670 align:middle line:90%
Some people love yoga.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Some people prefer
Qigong or tai chi.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Some might prefer
martial arts or dance.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:45.670 align:middle line:90%
So same thing with therapy.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Some people respond really
well to cognitive therapies.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Others, energy therapies,
others hypnotherapy.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So you want to play around with
this whole beautiful bundle

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:58.340 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities and then find
the one that works for you.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Like someone said
to me once, tell me,

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Dawson, you've done
all this research.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:84%
You've looked at all
these different therapies.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Which is the best therapy?

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, I'll tell
you the best therapy.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.025 align:middle line:84%
The best therapy is the
one that works for you.

00:36:13.025 --> 00:36:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Another time,
someone said to me,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.190 align:middle line:84%
what's the very best
form of meditation?

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I said, the best
form of meditation

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.197 align:middle line:84%
is the one you
will do every day.

00:36:20.197 --> 00:36:24.300 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHING] So play around in
all these different techniques

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and then pick the
one that resonates

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
with you energy system, with
your psyche, with your history,

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.210 align:middle line:90%
with your body.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> In your books, you talk about
a lot of different case studies

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.180 align:middle line:84%
of people that have been able to
achieve some pretty incredible

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.680 align:middle line:84%
results, either through
visualizing healing in the body

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe able to go
into remission from a cancer,

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:49.590 align:middle line:84%
or being able to bounce back
from a really significant

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.710 align:middle line:84%
financial or a life
trauma or issue.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.380 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the main
ones that stand out for you,

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.080 align:middle line:90%
that you really, really enjoy?

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> One of our therapists was
working with a woman in her

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.400 align:middle line:90%
early 30s.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And this woman wanted
a relationship,

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.980 align:middle line:84%
but she had a succession
of failed relationships.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And her belief was, all
the good men are taken.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.540 align:middle line:90%
She had this fixed belief.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So the therapist worked
with her on that belief.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Using EFT, she worked on
shifting that fixed belief.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.760 align:middle line:84%
She also had to make a list
of all the ideal qualities she

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.830 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see in a man.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:26.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was a long list.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.420 align:middle line:84%
There were 47
items on that list.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So after a few sessions of
working on that fixed belief

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:84%
that all of the men
are taken, the client

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:39.510 align:middle line:84%
came in to see the therapist
and said, I've met this guy,

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and it's wonderful.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.242 align:middle line:90%
I began to see him.

00:37:42.242 --> 00:37:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And the therapist said, well,
how many of your 47 qualities

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:45.500 align:middle line:90%
does he have?

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, not all 47,
but he has about 42 of them.

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.710 align:middle line:90%
So he's over the threshold.

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And so in the course
of the session,

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:84%
the therapist asked the client
just basic questions about,

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.200 align:middle line:90%
where did you meet him?

00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I met him at work.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the therapist asked the
client, just in terms of office

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.700 align:middle line:90%
geography, where does he work?

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.620 align:middle line:90%
How far is he from you?

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And the client said, about
two cubicles down from me.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And the therapist said, and
how long has he worked there?

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:19.420 align:middle line:90%
And the client said, six months.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And the therapist
thought to herself,

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Right has been
working two cubicles away

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:90%
from her for six months.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And she couldn't see him
because of her belief

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.385 align:middle line:90%
that all the good men are taken.

00:38:34.385 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
got married later on.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.427 align:middle line:84%
The therapist stayed in touch
with them for several years.

00:38:38.427 --> 00:38:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were a
perfectly happy couple.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:84%
So that belief was stopping her
from seeing her future husband

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.450 align:middle line:84%
two cubicles away from
her for six months.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.180 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
beliefs can be.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Now when you're trapped
in negative belief

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to build
positive neural capacity

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and new beliefs, it's hard.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Because your brain is used
to functioning in those ways.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.560 align:middle line:84%
We know from the work of Nobel
Prize winning professor, Eric

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Kandel, that if you pass a
signal through a neural bundle

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.985 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly for an hour, the
number of synapses can double,

00:39:09.985 --> 00:39:11.730 align:middle line:84%
or the number of
signaling hardware

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.413 align:middle line:90%
can double in one hour.

00:39:13.413 --> 00:39:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And so what if
you've been passing

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:16.390 align:middle line:84%
angry thoughts or
resentful thoughts

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.490 align:middle line:84%
or guilty thoughts
or shameful thoughts

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:84%
through those circuits for
years and years and years?

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.130 align:middle line:84%
You now have massive
neural bundles dedicated

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.690 align:middle line:90%
to sending those signals.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And now you think, gee,
I'm a miserable person.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm horrible to my kids.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:90%
I abuse my wife.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.720 align:middle line:90%
I miserable on my job.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I keep on having
financial disasters.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll go take a weekend
workshop at the Dawson Church,

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.865 align:middle line:84%
or Bruce Lipton or Deepak
Chopra or someone like that.

00:39:43.865 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they go to a Tony
Robbins workshop or Jody Spencer

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.900 align:middle line:84%
workshop or a Marianne
Williamson workshop.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And now you feel great
after the workshop.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:84%
You're in this temporary
state of euphoria.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:90%
You feel so good.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But then Monday morning, you're
back in your regular life

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:84%
with all the
stimuli that trigger

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.680 align:middle line:84%
the firing of those neural
bundles which you've been

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:90%
building for the last 30 years.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.368 align:middle line:84%
And you revert right
back to the way you are.

00:40:10.368 --> 00:40:12.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's the challenge
of personal growth.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to build that
signaling capacity.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:90%
We have to build that belief.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We have to build those
positive circuits,

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.990 align:middle line:84%
even before we have
the experience of them.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.220 align:middle line:90%
And that requires discipline.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need meditation,
why we need tapping,

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.670 align:middle line:84%
why we need to stick
with it over time.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you stick with it over
time, good things happen.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.460 align:middle line:84%
You build that
positive neural bundle

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that was so tiny at first, gets
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing about it
is, even if you've been angry

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:84%
for 50 years and you have a
gigantic neural bundle devoted

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.820 align:middle line:84%
to that, the other
flip side of the coin

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.910 align:middle line:84%
is that, if you don't use
the neural bundle for three

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:54.110 align:middle line:90%
weeks, your body notices.

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:57.902 align:middle line:84%
It's like it notices that
you're not using that wiring

00:40:57.902 --> 00:40:59.110 align:middle line:90%
and begins to disassemble it.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So within three
weeks, it says, gee.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.000 align:middle line:84%
He's not using the
anger circuit anymore.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:84%
We have better uses
for those molecules.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It then repurpose those
to build new circuits.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So our brains are
in this dynamic flow

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.230 align:middle line:84%
of rewiring with every
thought and every moment.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
negative beliefs,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.450 align:middle line:84%
if you quit thinking
those thoughts,

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.220 align:middle line:84%
adding fuel to the
fire, emotional fuel

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:27.070 align:middle line:84%
to the fire that is
signaling those circuits,

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.480 align:middle line:90%
they start to change.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.320 align:middle line:84%
In studies of long term,
long term meditators,

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.840 align:middle line:84%
research shows that
their brains start

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.110 align:middle line:90%
to function very differently.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.500 align:middle line:84%
The amygdala, which is
the brain's fire alarms,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.810 align:middle line:84%
the main organ which
sends that stress

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.130 align:middle line:84%
signal throughout
your whole body,

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.070 align:middle line:84%
it literally atrophies
in long term meditators.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
using those signals.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And the circuits of joy,
of happiness, of peace,

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:84%
of emotion regulation,
begin to grow.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:02.410 align:middle line:84%
In one of the case histories
in my book "Mind to Matter,"

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:06.430 align:middle line:84%
the man in this case
history was a TV host

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and an astrophysicist.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And he'd heard that
meditation produced benefits.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So he thought,
I'll give it a try.

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.560 align:middle line:84%
But he had a TV crew with
him, went into a university

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.170 align:middle line:84%
laboratory, and had a
comprehensive workup

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:20.770 align:middle line:84%
of his reaction times, his
stress levels, his hormones,

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:21.920 align:middle line:90%
his brain function.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And in a high
resolution MRI, they

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:84%
measured the volume of
every part of his brain.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:84%
He then began to
meditate, be mindful.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So week after week
after week, he

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:middle line:84%
began to feel more
and more peaceful.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.760 align:middle line:84%
He went back into the
lab after eight weeks

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.860 align:middle line:90%
of mindfulness practice.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And they measured the volume of
each part of his brain again.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And some parts had grown by
2%, 3%, 4% in just eight weeks.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But the part that grew the most
was a part of the hippocampus,

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that emotional midbrain
called the dentate gyrus.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And the dentate gyrus's
job is to coordinate

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.970 align:middle line:84%
emotional regulation among
multiple brain regions.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:08.400 align:middle line:84%
His dentate gyrus, in
eight weeks, grew by 22.8.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.500 align:middle line:84%
In just eight weeks of
changing consciousness,

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:16.650 align:middle line:84%
of changing mind, the
matter of his brain,

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and in particular,
the part of the brain

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.680 align:middle line:84%
responsible for regulating
emotion, reducing stress,

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.900 align:middle line:90%
that grew by 22.8%.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.450 align:middle line:90%
It did not take 10,000 hours.

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Did not take 10
years of practice.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:84%
In just eight weeks, we
can trigger remodeling

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:33.868 align:middle line:90%
of our neural tissue.

00:43:33.868 --> 00:43:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we have a
much happier life.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Increased emotion regulation
means, I don't yell at my kids.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't give people the finger
and have road rage when I'm

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.172 align:middle line:90%
driving to work in the morning.

00:43:44.172 --> 00:43:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm not screaming
at my colleagues.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm not causing my heart to
race and raising my cortisol

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:90%
with stress.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Emotion regulation is key.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.098 align:middle line:84%
And you do it much better
when you build those circuits.

00:43:56.098 --> 00:43:57.390 align:middle line:90%
So we can build those circuits.

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.100 align:middle line:84%
They then change the whole
experience we have of life.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But you have to start building
them in the absence of them.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So you aren't a peaceful
person at first.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And you have to practice
over and over and over again

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and prioritize being peaceful,
being happy, being optimistic

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.120 align:middle line:90%
over those old habits.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:90%
It takes a while to do that.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.170 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's called practice.

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.467 align:middle line:84%
But build those
circuits long enough,

00:44:18.467 --> 00:44:20.050 align:middle line:84%
they get bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And then all those circuits
of stress and anger

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:24.100 align:middle line:90%
just start to go away.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.590 align:middle line:90%
You might look the same.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Your face might look the
same after a few weeks

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.380 align:middle line:90%
of doing this.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Inside your brain, you
have a whole new brain.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.660 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine named Beth was
diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And they found a lump on
the top of her right breast.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it was measured
at five centimeters

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.750 align:middle line:90%
across, big, solid tumor.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.360 align:middle line:84%
She was being treated by a
famous cancer clinic called

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.360 align:middle line:84%
MD Anderson in Houston,
Texas and having

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.738 align:middle line:84%
great oncologists, great
surgeons, great staff there.

00:44:54.738 --> 00:44:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Once they found the
tumor, they began

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to look for signs
of the cancer having

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.055 align:middle line:90%
spread beyond the primary site.

00:45:01.055 --> 00:45:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And they found
that all the lymph

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.160 align:middle line:84%
nodes under her right
armpit near the tumor

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.060 align:middle line:90%
were all in flame.

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It looked as though cancer cells
were filling those lymph nodes.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.795 align:middle line:84%
Now when cancer gets into your
lymph system, it's bad news.

00:45:12.795 --> 00:45:13.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like your bloodstream.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.640 align:middle line:84%
It goes all
throughout your body.

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And once the cells, cancer
cells get into the lymph system,

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.520 align:middle line:84%
they can travel
throughout the body

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and produce secondary tumors
in other parts of your system.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And they then also found
three spots of inflammation

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:27.900 align:middle line:90%
on her right lung.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So it looked as though the
process had already begun.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the diagnosis
was so serious

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.890 align:middle line:84%
that the day she got
it, the oncologist,

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.830 align:middle line:84%
the cancer surgeon said
to Beth, in her office,

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.320 align:middle line:84%
she said, Beth,
normally we'd want you

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.770 align:middle line:90%
on chemotherapy and radiation.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.100 align:middle line:90%
We'd schedule you for that soon.

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:46.950 align:middle line:84%
This is so serious, I wanted
to go straight from my office

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:51.330 align:middle line:84%
right now to radiology
for your first treatment.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Now Beth said-- to her credit,
said, I need time to think.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.840 align:middle line:90%
This is my body.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:90%
These are my choices.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I need to just step back
from this for a moment.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So she did not go
straight to radiology.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And so she called friends
and e-mailed people like me

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and said, I've had
this diagnosis.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:09.870 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:12.360 align:middle line:84%
She got a lot of help, a
lot of recommendations.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And she decided to use
energy on her issue

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.180 align:middle line:90%
before conventional treatment.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And she cleaned up all of
the stress in her life.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:23.460 align:middle line:84%
She turned off the
alerts on her cell phone.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.900 align:middle line:90%
She quit watching the news.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.760 align:middle line:84%
She quit any kind of input
that could upset her or produce

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.080 align:middle line:90%
stress in her body.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:32.340 align:middle line:90%
She began to do Qigong.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.990 align:middle line:90%
She did EFT tapping.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:36.090 align:middle line:84%
She really amped up her
meditation practice.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.250 align:middle line:90%
She cleaned up her diet.

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Her diet was pretty good, but
she made her diet impeccable.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:84%
She did everything
possible to help herself.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So she got this
diagnosis in March.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:84%
She went back into the
hospital in May for a follow up

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.790 align:middle line:90%
eight weeks later.

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And all the lymph nodes on
her right armpit were clear.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.660 align:middle line:84%
The tumor had shrunk from 5
centimeters to 1.4 centimeters.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, the doctor
said, well, let's just

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:08.100 align:middle line:84%
stay with the surgery right
now and we'll cut that out.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.823 align:middle line:90%
And Beth said, I don't think so.

00:47:10.823 --> 00:47:12.990 align:middle line:84%
She also called me right
after she got the diagnosis

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and said, Dawson,
I've had a gene test.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I have eight defective
genes, some of which

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.070 align:middle line:90%
predispose me to breast cancer.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said her,
well, Beth, you have

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.410 align:middle line:90%
24,000 genes in your cells.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:30.900 align:middle line:84%
That means you have
23,992 that are just fine.

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.226 align:middle line:90%
Let's work with those.

00:47:32.226 --> 00:47:36.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So again, she did
all these things

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:42.270 align:middle line:84%
to raise, elevate her mood,
to make herself happier,

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:43.440 align:middle line:90%
to shift her energy.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And within just eight
weeks, that big change

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.320 align:middle line:84%
had happened with the tumor
shrinking and her lymph nodes

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.270 align:middle line:90%
being clear.

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Later on blood tests
showed there was not

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.548 align:middle line:90%
a trace of cancer in her body.

00:47:53.548 --> 00:47:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's been several
years now and there's still

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:56.880 align:middle line:90%
no cancer in her body.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the power of
mind over matter.

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.100 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say we'll
never need surgery,

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:90%
we'll never need a pill.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:04.410 align:middle line:90%
You may need surgery.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:05.490 align:middle line:90%
You may need a drug.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, what
we do energetically,

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.410 align:middle line:84%
what we do at the
level of consciousness

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to shift your cells, our
thoughts, our consciousness

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.590 align:middle line:84%
is so powerful, we're having
these effects on our bodies

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:17.520 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.415 align:middle line:84%
Use that as the
first thing you do

00:48:19.415 --> 00:48:21.540 align:middle line:84%
when you have a financial
challenge, a relationship

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.280 align:middle line:90%
challenge, a health challenge.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.500 align:middle line:84%
What can energy do to shift
your body, your finances,

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.210 align:middle line:84%
your relationships, and
the world around you?

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Personal growth
and psychology have

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.690 align:middle line:84%
been making a fundamental
error for a century.

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we measure
how sick people are

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and deficits and mental health.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So if I go into a
psychologist with anxiety,

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:46.580 align:middle line:84%
they'll measure
my anxiety level.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And if my treatment
is successful,

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I'll have zero anxiety
at the end of it.

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're measuring
depression, anxiety, and pain.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And the goal is zero.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.380 align:middle line:90%
But we don't want zero.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We want to become
vibrantly healthy.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to just have
no pain and no anxiety

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.750 align:middle line:90%
and no depression.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.540 align:middle line:90%
We want to have vibrant health.

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.220 align:middle line:90%
We want ecstasy every day.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the new science
of personal growth,

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.020 align:middle line:84%
the new human potential
is, what's above zero?

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And how high above
zero can we go?

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
way above zero.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:29.550 align:middle line:84%
We can achieve ecstatic states
in meditation and by tapping

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and reducing our stress.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm really
interested in right now

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is that whole question,
how far we go.

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And research shows
that even people

00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:41.010 align:middle line:84%
who meditated for
40,000 lifetime

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:43.890 align:middle line:84%
hours, a long, long,
long, long, long time,

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:48.240 align:middle line:84%
many hours every day, even
those people, their brains

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.500 align:middle line:90%
keep changing.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:53.310 align:middle line:84%
The happiness centers
keep on getting bigger.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:57.340 align:middle line:84%
The stress centers like the
amygdala keep on shrinking.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're now producing all
these beneficial changes

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:01.320 align:middle line:90%
in our brains and our bodies.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.640 align:middle line:90%
So ask yourself this question.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Who would you be if you
didn't have your old story?

00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:12.420 align:middle line:84%
If you were free of all the
things that hold you back?

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.680 align:middle line:90%
You could soar.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.830 align:middle line:84%
There's evidence showing
that we human beings

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:21.180 align:middle line:84%
have remarkable
capacities and we're just

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.190 align:middle line:90%
beginning to exercise them.

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And what moves the needle
more than anything else

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:29.250 align:middle line:84%
is two things, gratitude
and compassion.

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Those two-- in
brain research, it's

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:35.370 align:middle line:84%
shown that compassion
shifts brain function

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:37.050 align:middle line:90%
more than anything else.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And what's been happening
over the last 300 years

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.180 align:middle line:84%
is that we, as a human
species, have been

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.820 align:middle line:90%
becoming more compassionate.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:48.050 align:middle line:84%
300 years ago, there were
no democracies in the world.

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:52.260 align:middle line:84%
300 years ago, slavery was
prevalent all over the place.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.900 align:middle line:84%
300 years ago, no
woman had the vote.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.740 align:middle line:84%
300 years ago, child labor
was thought to be normal.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:02.220 align:middle line:84%
In just a few decades,
we reversed position

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:06.810 align:middle line:84%
globally on slavery, on
democracy, on women's rights,

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:08.340 align:middle line:90%
on child labor.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We've become more and more
and more compassionate

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.020 align:middle line:84%
as a species for
the last few years.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:16.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's changing our brains.

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.450 align:middle line:84%
In the last 33 years, the wealth
of the average global citizen

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.220 align:middle line:90%
has tripled.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Global wealth of the average
citizen has gone up 100 fold

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.000 align:middle line:90%
since 1800.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Infant mortality
has been dropping.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:32.603 align:middle line:84%
Human rights have
been improving.

00:51:32.603 --> 00:51:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Every measure of
human flourishing

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.190 align:middle line:84%
has been increasing
over the last while.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it, I think, is
due to our more compassionate

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.630 align:middle line:90%
brains.

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.525 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
problems we have

00:51:42.525 --> 00:51:44.400 align:middle line:84%
today-- we have all
these problems the world.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.230 align:middle line:90%
We have global warming.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We have weaponized
artificial intelligence

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that's threatening to
produce all kinds of problems

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.290 align:middle line:84%
among societies and
between nations.

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:56.700 align:middle line:90%
We have human trafficking.

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.620 align:middle line:90%
We have civil wars.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.727 align:middle line:90%
We have all these things.

00:51:58.727 --> 00:52:01.060 align:middle line:84%
We look at the world and say,
those things are terrible.

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.480 align:middle line:90%
How do you solve them?

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But research shows that
in these blissful states,

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:10.290 align:middle line:84%
in these ecstatic states, they
don't just make us feel better.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have
to extend meditation.

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:16.160 align:middle line:84%
They extend to the
world around us.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.590 align:middle line:84%
A 10 year study of high
performing executives

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:20.990 align:middle line:84%
by the McKinsey
Consultancy found

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that in flow states like
meditation producers,

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:29.400 align:middle line:84%
our productivity
increases by 500%.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.090 align:middle line:84%
A study by the Defense
Research Agency,

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.950 align:middle line:84%
DARPA, found that in
those elevated states,

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:41.270 align:middle line:84%
our problem solving
ability increases by 490%.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:middle line:90%
Our creativity explodes.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So now, as we're having
many, many people

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.890 align:middle line:84%
entering these
blissful states, we

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:52.130 align:middle line:84%
have increased leverage
over those global problems.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:53.070 align:middle line:90%
How many more people?

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, around 1980, about
1% of the population

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:01.460 align:middle line:84%
in most countries were
meditators, had some clue

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.980 align:middle line:84%
about seeking enlightenment,
seeking inner peace.

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.410 align:middle line:84%
If you look back in history,
go back to the Middle Ages,

00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:09.950 align:middle line:84%
there a survey showing
that about 1% of people

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:12.950 align:middle line:84%
were in some way engaged
in a spiritual journey.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And this 1% is very consistent
throughout the world,

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:16.910 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:22.790 align:middle line:84%
But in 2005, about 4% of
Americans were meditating.

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:26.360 align:middle line:90%
So it got from 1% in 1980 to 4%.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:31.410 align:middle line:84%
The latest research shows
it's about 15% of people.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So having this huge
growth curve of people

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:38.450 align:middle line:84%
entering these states at which
their productivity and problem

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:40.970 align:middle line:90%
solving ability quintuples.

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Now we have all these brains.

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're not only
individual brains.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:46.460 align:middle line:84%
They're coherent
with each other.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:50.820 align:middle line:84%
If I'm in coherence, in mental
coherence, in heart coherence,

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not only in
coherence with myself.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm in coherence with everyone
on the planet who's coherent.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So we have all of these
brains in these states.

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And the number of people doing
this increasing exponentially

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:05.920 align:middle line:84%
bringing all that problem
solving ability to bear

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:07.960 align:middle line:90%
on these wicked problems.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.492 align:middle line:84%
I am an absolute
optimist for the future.

00:54:10.492 --> 00:54:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll solve
all of these problems

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and we'll rise unprecedented
heights of flourishing.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Because the process is
geometric in its progression.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.883 align:middle line:84%
We get more and more
and more into the state.

00:54:20.883 --> 00:54:23.300 align:middle line:84%
We produce more and more of
these neurochemical chemicals.

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We change our brains
more and more.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.840 align:middle line:84%
We accelerate the
process of happiness.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And we then start to change
the world in ways that

00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:31.100 align:middle line:90%
make us flourish even more.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So the last 300
years, we've been

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:37.940 align:middle line:84%
creating, through compassion,
unprecedented flourishing.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Over the next 10,
20, 50 years, we'll

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:45.570 align:middle line:84%
be solving those problems with
the increased capacity we have.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So as you elevate
yourself above zero

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:55.670 align:middle line:84%
to that space of being in
bliss brain, being happy,

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:58.250 align:middle line:84%
feeling good, but also
changing your brain

00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and then having all of those
human capacities come online,

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:04.020 align:middle line:84%
they are not just there
for you in meditation.

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.340 align:middle line:84%
They're there for the world
and the world outside of you.

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So I believe we're going to
solve all kinds of problems

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and increase the process.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So the world my grandchildren
live in, I'm telling you--

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.660 align:middle line:90%
I went on a flight.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I went on a plane
trip this last week.

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And there was a long queue
to get through security,

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.630 align:middle line:84%
go through the metal
detectors, get on the plane.

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:30.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to bet that my
grandchildren, when they take

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:34.610 align:middle line:84%
a flight, they'll just drop
their bags off and walk

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:36.943 align:middle line:84%
onto the plane, no
metal detectors.

00:55:36.943 --> 00:55:38.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the world
we're heading to,

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.780 align:middle line:84%
a world of peace, a world of
love, a world where compassion

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.830 align:middle line:90%
is the norm.

00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I dream of a day when my
grandchildren come to me

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and say, granddaddy, I have a
school project I'm working on.

00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.120 align:middle line:90%
It's on this thing called--

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.640 align:middle line:90%
is it PSTD or PTSD?

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.770 align:middle line:90%
How do you spell it?

00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I know granddaddy used to be
involved in research into this.

00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:01.115 align:middle line:84%
He used to work with
veterans and refugees.

00:56:01.115 --> 00:56:03.680 align:middle line:90%


00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know anyone
with this weird disease.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.620 align:middle line:90%
What is it like?

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:07.550 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Now your grandparents talk
about diphtheria and polio.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know what
those diseases even are.

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I want a world where
our children don't

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:19.130 align:middle line:84%
know what depression
is or anxiety or PTSD.

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:20.240 align:middle line:90%
It's unknown now.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And we really have
it in our grasp.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Science shows, we
have it in our grasp,

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.320 align:middle line:90%
to produce that kind of a world.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.310 align:middle line:84%
We have those tools right now
and we're moving inevitably

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:33.543 align:middle line:84%
toward deploying
them to solving all

00:56:33.543 --> 00:56:34.710 align:middle line:90%
these bigger human problems.

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:35.777 align:middle line:90%
So the world is changing.

00:56:35.777 --> 00:56:36.860 align:middle line:90%
We're in the middle of it.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:37.660 align:middle line:90%
We are the people.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Now is the time.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.790 align:middle line:84%
It is such an exciting
moment to be alive,

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:43.790 align:middle line:84%
because that's where we're
headed in the aggregate,

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:46.790 align:middle line:90%
in the global, in the long term.

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Dawson Church, you're an
enormously infectious force

for good.

00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.577 align:middle line:84%
I love and cherish
this conversation

00:56:53.577 --> 00:56:54.410 align:middle line:90%
that we've just had.

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And I kick myself a
little bit that we

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.990 align:middle line:84%
didn't organize this
earlier, because this message

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:01.097 align:middle line:90%
is enormously important.

00:57:01.097 --> 00:57:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad and gracious that
we get to bring it to the world

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.460 align:middle line:90%
through these projects.

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:05.915 align:middle line:84%
I thank you so
much for your time.
