00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.552 align:middle line:84%
>> But I really never intended
to study functional medicine.

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about it.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.468 align:middle line:90%
I never heard about it.

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I got struck with
a catastrophic illness

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:84%
when I was 36,
about 20 years ago.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And doctor, after doctor,
after doctor, and no answers.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And took a while, but I
found the functional medicine

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.982 align:middle line:84%
community and
discovered that there's

00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:84%
a whole new way of
thinking about disease

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.028 align:middle line:90%
that got to the root cause.

00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So I began to sort of peel
the onion of why I was sick.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And the root of it
was mercury toxicity

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.800 align:middle line:90%
from living in China for a year.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And as I began to fix
that, my chronic fatigue

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
symptoms, my
autoimmunity, my gut

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.367 align:middle line:84%
problems, my cognitive
impairment all got better.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.229 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean the food industry is
driving most of our health care

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
crisis, our economic crisis,
even our environmental crisis,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
by the way we produce, and
grow, and process, and eat food.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
fundamental question

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.435 align:middle line:84%
that really nobody is tackling
at high levels of government.

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:21.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a social movement around
understanding the role of food

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:90%
in these processes and diseases.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
fundamental disconnect

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
between our understanding of
the role of food and disease

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and the action that's
taken by governments,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and professional
organizations, and physicians

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:84%
in actually dealing
with the drivers of most

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
of the disease we see today in
America and around the world

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:90%
increasingly.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Diabetes, obesity,
heart disease,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:84%
they're all driven by our
food and our food system.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And the plethora of processed
food, the industrialization

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
of food, the commodities
that are produced

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
in this country and around the
world, corn, soy, rice, flour,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.315 align:middle line:84%
gluten, dairy, these
are all driving so much

00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:00.940 align:middle line:84%
of the chronic illness
in this country.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, government
food programs,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.205 align:middle line:84%
if you're part of
those government food

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
programs in America, you are far
more likely to be overweight,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.240 align:middle line:84%
diabetic, obese, have
more cholesterol,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:84%
blood sugar because
of the food you're

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.873 align:middle line:84%
eating that's been provided by
the government food programs.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:90%
It's frightening.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Pepsi makes Gatorade.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And they market it as a health
drink, or as a sports drink,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:90%
or a hydration drink.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's a few
electrolytes in there.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.487 align:middle line:84%
But it's high
fructose corn syrup.

00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:31.287 align:middle line:90%
It's dyes.

00:02:31.287 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
transfats in them.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.393 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty frightening when
you look at the composition

00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:37.020 align:middle line:84%
of these sports
drinks and actually

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.393 align:middle line:90%
what they're doing to our kids.

00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:84%
If you are an athlete and
you're running a marathon,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.893 align:middle line:90%
OK, maybe there's a role for it.

00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:44.352 align:middle line:84%
But if you're an average kid,
running around the basketball

00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
court, and you have
Gatorade and you

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
drink one of those big
liters of Gatorade,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.430 align:middle line:84%
there's basically
tens of teaspoons

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:84%
of sugar in those that is
driving so much of the disease

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.800 align:middle line:90%
we see in America.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Why are kids overweight?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.217 align:middle line:84%
Why are kids
struggling in school?

00:02:57.217 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Why our kids having health
issues, academic issues,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:90%
depression issues?

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
It's really driven from
the food they're eating.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And these sports drinks seem
like they're a health food.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.376 align:middle line:84%
But they're actually one of
the worst things on the market.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:84%
America is one of the only
countries in the world, that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is a developed country, that
is allowing unrestricted food

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:90%
marketing to children.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And the worst foods
have the most marketing.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.098 align:middle line:84%
50 countries regulate and
restrict food marketing to kids

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
because we know these
kids at two years old

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
can recognize foods by
brands and call them out.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.602 align:middle line:84%
We know that they don't
understand what commercials are

00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and what's real or not until
they're eight years old.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And these are imprinting
on these kids, these foods

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and these brands,
that are driving

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
family choices, that are
driving these kids to be sick.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really one of
the most harmful policies we

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:90%
have in America.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
the food lobby

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:84%
has hijacked Congress
and the White House,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:84%
that allows these
policies to continue.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The food labeling confuses
and confounds people.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.098 align:middle line:84%
The dietary guidelines
confuse and confound people.

00:04:03.098 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And those guidelines and
those food labeling laws

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.182 align:middle line:84%
are driven through the
food lobby, unfortunately.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we know that there are
really clear policies that

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.417 align:middle line:90%
change behavior.

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Michael Bloomberg tried to
address this in New York City

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:90%
with taxing large sodas.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:90%
He tried to get a sugar tax.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't pass it through.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Philadelphia passed a sugar tax.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Berkeley passed a sugar tax.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Mexico has passed a sugar tax.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And we know that those
are effective in reducing

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.850 align:middle line:90%
obesity and preventing disease.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So we actually have
evidence that these work.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And then at scale, they can
have an impact on choice,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.340 align:middle line:90%
just like we tax smoking.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.397 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sugar is
the new tobacco.

00:04:43.397 --> 00:04:46.806 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:84%
This whole idea that sugar
is OK, and carbs are OK,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and fat is bad came
out of the '60s.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.290 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't by accident.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.080 align:middle line:84%
There was a movement
by the sugar industry

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and the lobby to actually vilify
fat and to exonerate sugar.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And they hired two
scientists from Harvard,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:84%
paid them the equivalent of
$50,000 in today's dollars,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
to write a review of
the research at the time

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.412 align:middle line:84%
because sugar was being
implicated in heart disease.

00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
discredit that theory.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.453 align:middle line:84%
And based on that article,
published in "The New England

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Journal" in 1967,
science for hire,

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
they were actually
able to catalyze

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
this movement of low
fat, high carbs, that's

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:90%
driven our obesity epidemic.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the obesity rates

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
after the dietary
guidelines came in 1980,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
it's a hockey stick up
in obesity and diabetes.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.650 align:middle line:84%
There has been a
seven-fold increase

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:84%
in the rate of diabetes
since 1980 around the world.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of
the plethora of sugar.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And now we have about
152 pounds of sugar

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
per person consumed
in America per year

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:90%
and about 146 pounds of flour.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
That's about a pound a
day of sugar and flour

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:90%
for every man, woman, and child.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies are just
not adapted to that.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you take out the
fat, you put in the sugar.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And the fat actually,
as we now know,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make you fat because
food is not just calories.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And fat has more calories
than carbs or protein.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.975 align:middle line:90%
Food is information.

00:06:08.975 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat the
right information,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:90%
it turns on the right signals.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
When you eat sugar and carbs,
it turns on fat storage.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:90%
It slows down your metabolism.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.318 align:middle line:90%
And it makes you hungry.

00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:84%
When you eat more fat,
it cuts your hunger.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:90%
It speeds up your metabolism.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And it releases fat
from the fat cells.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you
eat, for example,

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
a diet high in fat, let's say,
60% fat, 20% carbs versus 60%

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:84%
carbs, 10% fat, same
calories, the people

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
who eat the higher fat diet
will have a metabolism that

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%
brings 300 calories more a day.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
That's like running
an hour a day.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:84%
That would solve the
entire obesity epidemic

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:84%
if people switched their diets

Sure, I know Tom Brady.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And we've had many
conversations about food.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
In, fact he's one of
the very few sports

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.442 align:middle line:84%
legends who's not sold
out to the food industry.

00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the kinds
of commercials and advertising

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
he does, it has nothing
to do with sugar,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
or processed food, or fast
food, unlike many sports

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
figures who capitalize on
the food industry's desire

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:90%
to hijack them for their ends.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And Tom has been a
man of integrity.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's called out what
he sees as the truth, which

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
is that sugar is, in the way its
delivered to Americans, a drug.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
That it actually, the processed
food we sell our kids,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
is hurting them
and killing them.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And for him to stand
up with his credibility

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and say, yes, we
need to stop this,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.826 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a good thing.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.322 align:middle line:84%
For 30 years, I've
been looking at the gut

00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:90%
in functional medicine.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the foundation
of how we treat people

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.467 align:middle line:84%
with chronic illness
because we've

00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
understood that the gut flora
and damage to the gut lining,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
what we call leaky gut, is
driving so much disease.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was just in
a conference call

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.525 align:middle line:84%
"Exponential Medicine," where
one of the leading thinkers

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:57.400 align:middle line:84%
talked about his gut
microbiome and how

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
he discovered that so
much of autoimmune disease

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:84%
is driven through problems
with the gut microbiome.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's really
instrumental in creating

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
born by C-section,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.540 align:middle line:84%
when we are not breastfed, when
we've overused antibiotics,

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:84%
when we eat sugar
and processed foods,

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
when we don't need
fiber, when we

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
don't eat real
whole foods that are

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.490 align:middle line:84%
based on plant foods that
are driving healthy gut

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:90%
microbiomes, we get sick.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And now we're beginning to
have the science catch up

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.390 align:middle line:84%
with this observation
in functional medicine.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And we are now
seeing a revolution

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.690 align:middle line:84%
in our approach to
these chronic illnesses

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.452 align:middle line:84%
by dealing with the gut first
and helping people heal.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
The reason gluten is a problem
today is because the wheat

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
we're eating is not the wheat
we ate/ it's not the bread

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:90%
of our ancestors.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:84%
It's been modified
through hybridization

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
to create a super
strain of wheat

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.210 align:middle line:84%
called dwarf wheat,
which has many more

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.748 align:middle line:84%
proteins that
create inflammation,

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:90%
that are gluten proteins.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.110 align:middle line:84%
It also has a much
higher starch content.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, two
tablespoons of sugar

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle line:84%
raises your blood sugar
less than two slices

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:90%
of whole wheat bread.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So we now know that the
kind of wheat we're eating

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
is very inflammatory,
that we know that this

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:90%
can disrupt the gut lining.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:84%
Because of all
these other factors,

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.020 align:middle line:90%
it's catalyzed this problem.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So 50 years ago, they had
blood samples on 10,000 people,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:90%
looking at celiac disease.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And they compared it to a blood
sample of 10,000 people today.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And there was a real increase
of 400% in celiac disease.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:90%
So this is not a fad.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a real phenomenon that's
a result of the increasing

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
rates of C-sections,
the use of antibiotics,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
the lack of breastfeeding,
the processed food,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and the chronic stresses
environmental toxins,

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
all colluding to
drive disruptions

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
in the gut function,
which allows the gluten

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.580 align:middle line:84%
to actually break
through and create

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.230 align:middle line:90%
the systemic inflammation.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you have any inflammatory
condition or really

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
any chronic condition,
gluten should

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
be at the top of your list
in thinking about why?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's an autoimmune
disease, digestive disorders,

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
depression, neurologic
issues, many of these things

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.965 align:middle line:90%
are driven through gluten.

00:10:00.965 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And by doing an
elimination diet,

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:90%
you can often see the impact.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen athletes like
Djokovic, who's actually

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.970 align:middle line:84%
accelerated his
career by removing

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
inflammatory foods like
gluten, and dairy, and sugar.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.830 align:middle line:84%

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's a spectrum
of reactions to foods,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.817 align:middle line:84%
from all the way
from a mild reaction,

00:10:30.817 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
we might have a little stomach
upset or a little inflammation,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
all the way to full-blown
autoimmune disease.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So in medicine we tend to
think of things as on or off.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:90%
You have them or you don't.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.910 align:middle line:84%
The truth is the body's
more complex than that.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And reactions to gluten
can be along a spectrum.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And anywhere along that
spectrum can create symptoms.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And create cognitive
issues, digestive issues,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:90%
immune issues.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%

really unlucky, you

might have full-blown
celiac disease.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:84%
What I would
recommend is anybody

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:84%
who thinks they have any chronic
issues, to do a short-term diet

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:90%
elimination.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.190 align:middle line:84%
It could be like my 10-day
detox diet, which is 10 days.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be a 21-day program.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
You just should stop the foods
that are driving inflammation

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:84%

in how you feel.

Well, the truth is there is
no such thing as junk food.

There's only junk
and there's food.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And the foods that we're
eating today are not real food.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:90%
They're food-like substances.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:84%
They're manufactured, processed,
extruded, colored, dyed foods,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that if you actually
cover the label

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:84%
on the front of the
package on most foods

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and you read the label, you
won't be able to actually tell

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:40.650 align:middle line:90%
what it is.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell the Twinkie by
looking at the ingredient list?

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:90%
You cannot.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.422 align:middle line:84%
But if it's an avocado,
it's just an avocado.

00:11:45.422 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So essentially what
I recommend to people

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:84%
is eat foods that don't have
nutrition fact labels, that

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:84%
don't have ingredient list,
and that don't have a barcode

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:90%
because they're just food.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
An avocado doesn't have
an ingredient list.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:84%
An almond doesn't have
a nutrition facts label.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:90%
And eggs don't have a barcode.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:90%
They're just food.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:90%
So it's really not complicated.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:90%
I do programs in large churches.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:90%

food that man made,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:90%
eat the food that God made.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And any kindergarten
kid can understand that.

00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:90%
So food is information.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And that means that the
quality and the type of food

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:84%
you're eating has a huge
impact on your gene expression,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
your hormones, your
metabolism, your gut

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:90%
flora, your immune system.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:90%
And it happens with every bite.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at fat,
they're not all created equal.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Sugar is sugar is sugar.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:90%
But fats are quite diverse.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
You can have really good quality
fats, like omega-3 fats, that

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:90%
are essential.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You can have
monounsaturated fats,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
that have been shown to reduce
heart attacks, like olive oil,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:90%
and nuts, and seeds.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.803 align:middle line:84%
And you can have
refined vegetable oils,

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:90%
which are very inflammatory.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
These were not consumed by
humans a hundred years ago.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:90%
They are highly refined.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
They're extracted with hexane,
and chemicals, and heat.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And they sometimes
are deodorized,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
which creates all these
chemical byproducts.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
As well as this
refining of these oils

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:84%
that have allowed us to consume
a thousand times more soybean

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.013 align:middle line:84%
oil, for example, than we
did a hundred years ago.

00:13:10.013 --> 00:13:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies just don't
know what to do with that.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And it creates this
imbalance in the fatty acids.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And then there's transfats,
which are clearly

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.140 align:middle line:84%
the worst fats on the planet,
which are manmade fats,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
like Crisco,
shortening, margarine.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And these are designed to be
solid at room temperature.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
They're vegetable oils
that are made to be

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:90%
solid at room temperature.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
found to increase

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.470 align:middle line:84%
the risk of heart attacks,
of obesity, diabetes,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:90%
maybe even cancers.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And really now been banned
by the FDA, Food and Drug

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Administration, because
they're not considered,

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.618 align:middle line:90%
quote, "safe to eat."

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.810 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
controversial areas still,

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:84%
everybody agrees that
omega-3 fats are good,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and avocados, and nuts and
seeds, and olive oil is good.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:90%
That transfats are bad.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Refined oils, most
people still agree

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that they're bad, although some
still suggest they're good.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.560 align:middle line:84%
They only controversy
really is saturated fat.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And there really is no such
thing as saturated fat.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:90%
There are saturated fats.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's coconut oil,
which has lauric acid.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:84%
There is beef saturated
fats, so stearic acid.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.538 align:middle line:84%
There is dairy saturated
fats, which are margaric acid.

00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So that all these have
different properties and effects

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:90%
on the body.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, large
trials now have

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:84%
found that there's no link
between saturated fat and heart

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.810 align:middle line:84%
There's no link between
total fat and heart disease.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And some studies even have
shown an inverse relationship.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:84%
For example, a study of
3,000 people, 15 years,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
looking at their blood
levels of saturated fats

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:84%
found that those with the
highest levels of dairy fat,

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
essentially butter in your
blood, had a 40% or 50%

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:84%
reduction in their
risk of diabetes.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Another big review of butter,
for example, and looking

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:84%
at 6 and a half
million patient years,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
600,000 people over many,
many, many, many years,

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:84%
found that those who had the
highest intakes of butter

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:90%
had the lowest risk of diabetes.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And they had no increase in
their risk of heart attacks.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.087 align:middle line:84%
So we begin to look at the
changing nature of the data.

00:14:58.087 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't think butter
is a health food.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.545 align:middle line:84%
But I also don't think
it should be vilified.

00:15:01.545 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And as part of a healthy diet,
it can be very good for you.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's only
bad-- and this

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:84%
is really important-- it's
only bad if you're consuming it

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:90%
along with starch and sugar.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:90%
So think ice cream.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, think bread and butter.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not the saturated fat.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And if I had to choose
between a bagel and butter,

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:90%
I would eat the butter.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:90%

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So the foods that
your gut flora like

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:84%
are mostly plant foods,
vegetables, nuts and seeds,

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:84%
beans, whole grains, real
food, high fiber foods.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And even special fibers,
things like chia seeds,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
flax seeds, prebiotic
types of foods,

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
inulin that comes from Jerusalem
artichokes, artichokes.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Various kinds of foods
that actually can help

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.267 align:middle line:90%
fertilize the healthy bacteria.

00:15:53.267 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And the more you eat of those,
the more healthy bacteria

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:84%
The less sugar and
processed food you have,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:90%
the better your bacteria are.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So fermented foods
can be very healthy

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:90%
if your gut is not too bad.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.205 align:middle line:84%
If you have yeast overgrowth,
if you had really bad gut flora,

00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
it can be a challenge
to eat fermented foods.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But in an otherwise
healthy person,

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:84%
eating more fermented foods
can be very effective.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Things like sauerkraut,
and kimchi, and miso,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and traditional foods that
have been around for centuries

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.474 align:middle line:90%
can be very helpful for the gut.

00:16:30.722 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
friends who are vegans.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of friends
who are paleo folks.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting on a panel
with one vegan cardiologist

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:90%
and a paleo doctor.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was in the middle.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.027 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, gee, if you're
paleo and you're vegan,

00:16:42.027 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I must be a pegan.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was kind of a joke.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:46.027 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized that
it's exactly what we should

00:16:46.027 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
be eating, which is
mostly plant foods,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
by volume; good quality fats;
healthy, sustainably raised

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and humanely raised
animal foods,

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
whether it's grass-fed meets
or sustainably harvested

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:84%
or farmed fish; whole
eggs that are farm eggs;

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
good fats, like nuts and
seeds; avocados, olive oil,

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:90%
coconut oil.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Even grass-fed butters are fine.

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Limiting too much
starch-- so grains are OK.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But gluten-free grains
are preferable, not

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of white rice,
and pasta, and bread;

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
but some whole grains, more as
a condiment than a main course.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.869 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with beans.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Dairy I think can be
problematic for many people.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I recommend limiting
that unless you

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:90%
can get grass-fed goat cheese.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Sheep cheese are often better.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, really
then simple foods.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
the best quality

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can possibly
get, that can

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.047 align:middle line:90%
help you sustain your health.

00:17:41.047 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't actually
have to be that expensive.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:46.004 align:middle line:84%
It can be just real,
whole fresh foods.

00:17:49.448 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
A hundred years ago, there were
very few environmental toxins

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
There have been 80,000
new chemicals introduced

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
into our environment,
in our food supply,

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.590 align:middle line:90%
over the last 100 years.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of those have not
been tested for safety.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, glyphosate is
now sprayed in all the wheat

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that we eat, to defoliate
them before they harvest them.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's a high
concentration of glyphosate.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Or what we call Roundup
which is used on soybeans.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
But that's been found
to affect gut flora.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Found to affect
oxidative stress,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:90%
and have other untoward effects.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:90%
It's been linked to cancer.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're exposed
to this plethora

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.932 align:middle line:84%
of environmental toxins that
stresses our system, that

00:18:24.932 --> 00:18:27.140 align:middle line:84%
affects our gut, that affects
our immune system, that

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:90%
affects our metabolism.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
We now know that
these toxins have

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
been linked to obesity,
and diabetes, and cancer,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.390 align:middle line:90%
and heart disease.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So we really have to take a
serious look at the quality

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:90%
of the food we're eating.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people to follow
some simple principles.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Filter your water if you can.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Eat only sustainably,
humanely raised,

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
organic grass-fed
animal products;

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
low mercury fish, things like
tuna, swordfish, halibut, sea

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
bass all contain higher
levels of mercury.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.868 align:middle line:90%
Eat the smaller fish.

00:18:51.868 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And I called it the
smash fish, which

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
are salmon, mackerel, anchovies,
sardines, and herring.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And then in terms
of vegetables, know

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.612 align:middle line:84%
there are ones that
are more contaminated

00:19:03.612 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and ones that are less,
same thing with fruits.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Environmental Working
Group, where I'm on the board,

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.968 align:middle line:84%
they've created very simple
lists of the Dirty Dozen.

Here's the 13 foods, and
fruits, and vegetables

00:19:12.168 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:90%
that are the most contaminated.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.230 align:middle line:84%
You should buy
organic when you can.

that are pretty safe to eat,

00:19:18.033 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:90%
even if they're not organic.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:90%
They can save you money.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So really finding
some simple principles

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
around the choices you make
can make a profound impact

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:90%
on lowering your risk.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
We also have a
household cleaning guide

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.580 align:middle line:84%
on the Environmental
Working Group.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:84%
What products you should
use that are safe to eat?

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.183 align:middle line:84%
Skin deep, it's
about what products

00:19:32.183 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:90%
you're putting on your skin.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:84%
You're putting paraben,
and lead in lipstick,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.993 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of chemicals
that are in your skin

00:19:37.993 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:84%
care products that
could be harming you.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage you to check
out the Environmental Working

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Group's website, to look at
the food you should be eating.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
things you'd be putting
on your skin, the things

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.425 align:middle line:84%
you should be cleaning
your house with,

00:19:47.425 --> 00:19:49.216 align:middle line:84%
and how to reduce your
overall exposures.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, we now know that the
effect of stress on the body

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:90%
is profound.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And even if you eat perfectly,
if you're chronically stressed,

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
you can create depressed
immune function.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:84%
You can cause a gut
disruption and leaky gut.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:90%
You can cause depression.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:84%
You can create
inflammation of the body.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And so techniques that help
the body to reset and restore

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:90%
are critical.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the key
foundational principles

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.830 align:middle line:90%
of functional medicine.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So in my practice,
I often recommend

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:84%
people learn various
techniques that work for them,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
whether it's yoga; whether
it's meditation, or prayer,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:90%
or nature experiences.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I find
meditation very powerful.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.730 align:middle line:84%
I think the literature
on it is profound

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.830 align:middle line:84%
in terms of optimizing
gene expression,

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:84%
regulating the immune system,
affecting the brain structure,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.890 align:middle line:84%
increasing neuroplasticity, the
connection between brain cells,

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:84%
creating new brain
cells, increasing stem

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.130 align:middle line:90%
cell production of the body.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So we know it's not just this
Eastern hokey pokey thing.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:84%
It actually has real
biologic effects

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
that transform your
health every day.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's one of the
most powerful things I've

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.790 align:middle line:84%
begun to do as a practice
because other than food

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
as medicine, and
exercise, it's probably

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important levers
I found to create my own health

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and to actually
help my patients.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I think the power of
the mind is staggering.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And in my own life,
I've been very clear,

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
when I have a pure
intention and I

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:84%
set a goal that's
not self-serving,

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that the universe conspires
to actually make it all happen

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:84%
in remarkable ways that
I couldn't coordinate

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:90%
or orchestrate on my own.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think that having
clear desires and intentions

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
about what you want to do
and how you want to do it.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.465 align:middle line:84%
If it's not just
about self-growth,

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:90%
then it makes a difference.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I saw a fascinating
study recently

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.000 align:middle line:84%
where they found
that people who acted

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
on an altruistic basis
versus self-serving basis,

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
doing good things in the world,
they had very different effects

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:90%
on the immune system.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The people who did
things for others,

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
out of love in their
heart, versus self-serving,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:84%
they had a much better
immune response.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Versus people who
were self-serving,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
they depressed
their immune system.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I think most people don't
realize that thoughts

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
are things, that they
have powerful impact

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.270 align:middle line:90%
on our biology and our lives.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And that how you direct
your attention and your mind

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:84%
determines the
course of your health

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:90%
and the course of your life.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.787 align:middle line:84%
And once you have that
insight, then you're

00:22:22.787 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
going to stop playing the
tapes that are negative,

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.975 align:middle line:84%
complaining, and not
serving the purpose

00:22:27.975 --> 00:22:29.100 align:middle line:90%
that you want in your life.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.782 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very simple
insight, but it

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:32.490 align:middle line:84%
can have a profound
effect on the quality

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.002 align:middle line:90%

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our ancient
reptile brain

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is programmed to respond
with fear to danger.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a hard-wired response.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It protects us from
bad situations.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But most the time
fear obstructs us

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
because it's based on
our ego, on challenging

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:90%
who we think we are.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the things that I

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.850 align:middle line:84%
think I found for myself is
that I decided disidentify

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.430 align:middle line:84%
with my ego in a
very active way.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So I don't take anything
personally, either good things

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.938 align:middle line:90%
or bad things.

00:23:07.938 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So people say to me, how
can you go on television

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:90%
in front of 5 million people?

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.160 align:middle line:84%
How do you go on stage
and not be nervous?

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like I'm
serving something much bigger

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.060 align:middle line:90%
than myself.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about my
own ego gratification

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:90%
or self-satisfaction.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And by having that idea that
the self that I think I am

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
is not really real, that
it's just a construct, then

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:84%
it frees me up to do whatever
I want to do without fear.

I think Wim Hof has
basically tapped

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:84%
as ancient science of
yoga breathing to catalyze

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:90%
changing your biology.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is not a new thing.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:84%
These special powers have
been available to yogis

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.557 align:middle line:84%
for centuries as a
spiritual practice.

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's just catalyzed these
and shown that we actually

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.035 align:middle line:84%
have much more control over our
biology than we think we have.

00:23:59.035 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
really great insight

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:84%
to empower people
to take control

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.920 align:middle line:90%

It's actually connection,

greater community, that's

moving in a way that is actually
bringing good to the world.

populations that are happy,

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:90%
they all have that in common.

your friends, your

inspire you, and

that's outside of you, in your

to be part of that,

whether it's as a volunteer;
whether it's as a job;

whether it's an innovator,
an entrepreneur;

a larger movement,

I never set out to
change the world.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Really, I just set out to do the
things that I thought mattered,

that I cared about.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.970 align:middle line:84%
They were driven off of my
own suffering and being sick.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So I used that to
catalyze what happened.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I went to Haiti
after the earthquake

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.802 align:middle line:84%
and had this
traumatic experience.

00:25:35.802 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:84%

my understanding

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.052 align:middle line:84%
about the power of social
community to change behavior.

00:25:40.052 --> 00:25:41.760 align:middle line:84%

choices that I made

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.810 align:middle line:84%
or the things that I set
out to do on purpose.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.300 align:middle line:84%
I just found the things
that actually mattered.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I started focusing on
them, and then communicating

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And sort of the rest
all just happens.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that if I
got a chance to have

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
a microphone to the
world for a minute,

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:84%
I would encourage
people to connect

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.840 align:middle line:84%
with the families, and
communities, and friends

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.150 align:middle line:84%
around them and
actually find a way

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to catalyze the power of
that for good in the world

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.920 align:middle line:84%
because we are so
much better together.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:84%
We're so much better
as a community.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
catalyze change

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.880 align:middle line:84%
in any area that
matters in our lives.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think if I were to
sort of have a minute,

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I would really say focus
on that because that

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.125 align:middle line:90%
can help change poverty.

00:26:33.125 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:90%
It can change the food system.

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:35.780 align:middle line:90%
It can change politics.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.778 align:middle line:84%
It can change the health
of the communities.

00:26:37.778 --> 00:26:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And all those things can be
catalyzed by people working

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.923 align:middle line:90%
together as a community.

00:26:42.923 --> 00:26:44.847 align:middle line:90%

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
The biggest threat facing
us today is invisible.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It's food injustice.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.567 align:middle line:84%
It's as a result of
the food policies

00:26:53.567 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:84%
from our government
that are promoting

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.550 align:middle line:84%
the production and the
growing of food commodities

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that drive disease, and
our allowing of food

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.290 align:middle line:84%
marketing to kids,
and our having

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
of subsidizations of sugar and
processed food, and food stamps

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.160 align:middle line:84%
that by $4 billion worth of
soda a year for the poor.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.550 align:middle line:84%
There's so many examples of ways
in which our food policies are

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:90%
driving disease.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:14.710 align:middle line:90%
They're driving poverty.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:90%
They're driving violence.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:84%
They're driving destruction
of our environment.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.317 align:middle line:84%
And they're even driving
damage to our economy.

00:27:20.317 --> 00:27:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things
have to be addressed.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.618 align:middle line:84%
And most people internalize
what they're eating.

00:27:25.618 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
it's food injustice.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
If you are an
African American, you

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.820 align:middle line:84%
can't sit at a counter because
of the color of your skin.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.778 align:middle line:90%
People understand that.

00:27:31.778 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you're targeted
by the food industry

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and drinking two-liter
bottles of soda

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and you think that's normal
as part of your diet,

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.330 align:middle line:84%
that's internalized
food injustice.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.142 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
actually, as a society,

00:27:42.142 --> 00:27:43.600 align:middle line:84%
step up and go,
hey, wait a minute,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:44.980 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
take it anymore.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at the ways
in which the food industry is

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.583 align:middle line:84%
driving behaviors,
and driving behaviors

00:27:49.583 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
through the production of food,
and the marketing of food,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and the food policies that
are promoting these things.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I think it can begin
to turn the tide

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:57.970 align:middle line:84%
and get people to
understand that we

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.280 align:middle line:84%
need to create a movement
to stop the food injustice.

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
It's harming our
communities, our families,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and even our social
fabric and our economy.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.083 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
understand that what

00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:84%
you put at the end
of your fork is

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
more powerful than any drug
you'll find in a pill bottle.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.500 align:middle line:84%
That food is not just like
medicine, it is medicine.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Food is a better
drug than most drugs.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.553 align:middle line:84%
It works faster,
better, and it's cheaper

00:28:18.553 --> 00:28:19.720 align:middle line:90%
than any drug on the market.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And it has no side
effects, except good ones.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think most
physicians don't understand

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.703 align:middle line:84%
that the food that
we're eating in American

00:28:26.703 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and around the
world increasingly,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:90%
is driving most chronic disease.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:90%
That it can be cured by disease.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet doctors learn nothing
about food in medical school.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So we are in this
crisis point where

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:40.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a disconnect
between our understanding

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.020 align:middle line:84%
of the power of food as medicine
and the implementation of this

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to solve our chronic
disease epidemic.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And that has to break down so
we can begin to shift the tide

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and actually get the
health care system

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to understand the power
of food as medicine.
