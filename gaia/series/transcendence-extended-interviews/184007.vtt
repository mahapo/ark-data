00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:13.702 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The early part of my
career was really based

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.210 align:middle line:84%
on understanding the
conventional science.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.640 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching medical
students, so I was really

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.440 align:middle line:90%
teaching from a curriculum.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And while I was teaching
conventional science, which

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:84%
was based on what is called
"genetic determinism,"

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.925 align:middle line:84%
the belief that genes
control our lives,

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I was engaged with
cloning stem cells.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's
very interesting

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
because I was cloning
them back in 1967.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
there were just

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
a handful of us in
the entire world that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:90%
even knew what a stem cell was.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So I was in the right
place at the right time

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
with the right
research to reveal

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that what I was teaching in
medical school was incorrect.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
That I started to understand
from the cell culture

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
studies that it was
the environment that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:84%
was controlling the genetics,
rather than the genetics

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:90%
controlling itself.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course,
led to a schism.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:84%
How can I be teaching
in a classroom

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that genes control life and
then go in the laboratory

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and realize that it
was the environment

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
in which the cells were living
that controlled the genetics.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I ended up actually
leaving the system.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And I walked out.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.490 align:middle line:90%
I had tenure and walked out.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But I also then
had an opportunity

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:84%
to go into quantum
physics and you go, why?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is very
profoundly important.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
As a biologist, almost
all of my colleagues--

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
the conventional physics was
called "Newtonian physics."

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian physics
separates the universe

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.440 align:middle line:84%
into an invisible
energy realm and

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:90%
a physical mechanical realm.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian physics says that
the mechanical realm is not

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.560 align:middle line:90%
affected by the energy realm.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.103 align:middle line:84%
So you want to understand
a physical body,

00:01:49.103 --> 00:01:50.520 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
really understand

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
the physical
mechanics of the body

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and ignore the so-called
invisible realm.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
When quantum physics
came in, it completely

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:90%
turned the tables on that.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:90%
And it said that--

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
it didn't get it didn't get
rid of Newtonian physics.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Newtonian physics is a smaller
science inside a larger science

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
called quantum physics.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And basically, quantum physics
revealed that everything

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:90%
is connected by energy.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And you say, so why is
this relevant to biology?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
physics means mechanisms.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So I can say, quantum
mechanics, quantum physics.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And I say, physics mechanics.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Mechanics means how things
work in the universe.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So even if you want
to be a biologist,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
you really have to understand
the mechanics of physics.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So when quantum physics
came in, it completely

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:84%
conflicted with
Newtonian-based medicine.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And all my colleagues
were Newtonian-based,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and all of a
sudden, I'd jump off

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
into the deep end of
energy medicine, which

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:90%
is the new physics.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And understanding that
led me to a position

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
at Stanford University
School of Medicine,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.110 align:middle line:84%
where I expanded on my
research with cloning

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
stem cells and also
about the field--

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the energy field--
and the influence.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, it
led to my finding

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.400 align:middle line:90%
a whole new career for myself.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And that science--
which is kind of fun,

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
because when I first started
talking about this years ago,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
my colleague said,
you're a crazy person.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Your ideas are crazy.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And just like
couple of years ago,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
a scientist in one of my
lectures came up at the end

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and said, say, Lipton, what
are you saying that's new?

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So, we went from freaking
him out to boring them.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, yes, the
science has come a long way

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and evolved and says that our
complete vision of genetics

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and the concept of
DNA controlling life

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:90%
is totally false.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And why this is important is
very simply, all science--

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
genes control you; you
don't control the genes.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:84%
You're a victim
of your heredity.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is running
in your family,

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
you can likely expect to get
that because of the genes

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:90%
that are running in the family.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
The new physics is
completely different.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It says that environment
is controlling your genes.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you change your
response to the environment,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
change your
environment, then you

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:90%
have power over your biology.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Bottom line is simple.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:84%
We move from victim
biology genetics

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to master of
biology epigenetics.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is an exciting time
because this is the time for us

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:90%
to recover our power--

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.535 align:middle line:84%
that we are very powerful
in controlling our biology.

00:04:32.535 --> 00:04:36.247 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:40.527 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:90%
Very simple understanding.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:84%
If you go to an Apple
store and you buy an iPod

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and you take it out of the store
and you push play on the iPod,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:90%
nothing plays.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you're now
upset about the fact

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:84%
that you just spend all
this money and your iPod

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:84%
doesn't work and then
some little 7-year-old kid

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
next to you looks
up and goes, hey,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:84%
hey Mister, unless you
download something first,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.450 align:middle line:90%
it will not work.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:90%
The idea is exactly the same.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
The mind has a
conscious creative mind,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
but a subconscious
programmed mind.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.970 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind does
not go into full operation

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:90%
until after age seven.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
The first seven years, the
mind is in a lower vibrational

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.695 align:middle line:90%
state called theta.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is when you can
read this by putting wires

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:90%
on a person's head, EEG.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.930 align:middle line:84%
The relevance of
theta is that it

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.950 align:middle line:84%
represents imagination, which is
what kids under seven live in.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Half the world is imagination.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The mother says,
give me the broom,

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:84%
the child says, I don't
know what you're talking

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:90%
about-- this is a horse.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
So to the child, the brain in
the imagination state of theta

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:90%
actually is the horse.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:90%
So theta is imagination.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:84%
More important,
theta is hypnosis.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The relevance about that is,
if you think of all the rules

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
an individual must
learn to become

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
a functional member of a family
and a community, thousands

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:90%
of rules.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, how do you teach
an infant thousands of rules?

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, well,
you can't give them a book

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and you can't teach
them in a school.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what we have
to understand is this,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
nature created the first seven
years of download hypnosis

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
to observe other people--
the parents, the siblings,

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:90%
and the community.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Observe their behavior
and directly download

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.890 align:middle line:84%
their behavior as the
foundational download

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
of behavior.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Once a child is
becoming conscious,

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
which is around age
seven, the conscious mind

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
will use that programming
to maneuver in the world.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
The most important
part is this--

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.300 align:middle line:84%
we have to recognize
that this is a program.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And number two is that most of
the programming psychologists

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
have revealed is negative
and disempowering.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And number three is that
we are capable of changing

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.777 align:middle line:90%
the program.

00:06:54.777 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand
that, then you

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.380 align:middle line:84%
are free to rewrite
the story of your life.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't do that,
your life has been programmed.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is not anything new.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.560 align:middle line:84%
For 400 years, the Jesuits
have said, give me a child

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:84%
until it's seven and I
will show you the man.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
What people didn't understand
they were saying is,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:84%
if I get to program
the first seven years,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I will determine the outcome
of that individual's life.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds like, oh,
that's an interesting fact.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I go, it's a fact that has
never been lost in 400 years.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, today we're being
program much more effectively

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:84%
than the Jesuits were
programming 400 years ago.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.130 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.877 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.877 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
The hardest part
about the programming

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
is it occurs before
your mind actually

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
enters into consciousness,
which is alpha vibration.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So the first seven years,
you're downloading.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And you've been
downloading since actually

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
before you were born in
last trimester of pregnancy.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So the question
becomes very seriously,

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:90%
what are my programs.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And then why it
becomes a question is,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
you were not even conscious when
the programs are downloaded.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So you say, oh, I don't
know what my programs are.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I learned
when I was one-year-old.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So the exciting part
about it is that science

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
has recognized that
95% of our life

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:84%
comes from
subconscious programs.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:90%
So a simple truth is this--

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
you look at your life, and it
is a printout of your programs.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's simple.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know who
said what, who did what.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
That's blaming the
messenger over the message.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The message is what did
you learn-- program.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, but
the program is what

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.164 align:middle line:90%
you're playing 95% of the time.

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, look at your
life, and it comes down simple

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:90%
and it goes like this.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
The things that you like
that come into your life

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
come in because you have
programs to accept those.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
The other part,
though, is anything

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.190 align:middle line:84%
that you work hard at,
struggle over, sweat over, what

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:90%
you put a lot of effort into.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Question, why are
you working so hard

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:90%
to make these things manifest?

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The answer inevitably is, your
programs in your subconscious

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:90%
do not support that end.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So the simple point is, you
want to know your programming,

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:90%
look at your life.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.120 align:middle line:84%
As I said, the things
you like that come

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:84%
are there because you have
programs to support them.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But in contrast, anything
you must work at,

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
anything you have to put effort
into to manifest in your life.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
The amount of work
you're putting in

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
is really to
compensate for the fact

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that you have a program
that doesn't support that,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying
to override it.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.248 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:30.248 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
The problem of who's
running the show

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:84%
is whether the programs
in the subconscious

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
are running the show or
whether the conscious

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.823 align:middle line:90%
is running the show.

00:09:42.823 --> 00:09:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
is simply this--

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind
is the driver.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.960 align:middle line:90%
That's who you are.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
That's your identity,
your source, your spirit.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And why it becomes relevant is
that the conscious mind, when

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
driving the vehicle, controls
where that body, vehicle is

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:90%
going to go.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
But when the conscious
mind is thinking,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.350 align:middle line:84%
then the default
control, the autopilot,

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.413 align:middle line:84%
steps in, which is
called the subconscious.

00:10:09.413 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the simple
point is this--

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I asked you a simple question.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I say, what are you doing
on Monday at 2 o'clock,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
if you actually try to
answer that question,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:90%
you have to go inside.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I say, oh, the conscious
mind is going inside

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to answer the question,
then who's controlling

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:90%
where you are outside?

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're walking down the
street and you're thinking,

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.715 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean you stop until
the thought is complete.

00:10:28.715 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:90%
You're still walking.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're driving a car
and you're thinking,

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:90%
you're still driving the car.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Point-- when the
conscious mind is busy

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:84%
thinking, 95% of the day, which
is science's recognition, that

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:90%
means 95% of the day.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Your program is being run by
autopilot default, subconscious

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:90%
programming.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Problem-- the
subconscious programs

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
primarily came
from other people.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So it says, 5% of the day, you
are controlling your biology

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.910 align:middle line:84%
to go toward your destination,
wherever you want.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
95% of the day,
you're in thought.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So the autopilot subconscious
is working 95% of the day.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
But those represent the programs
downloaded from other people.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:90%
The conclusion is simple--

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:84%
you're only controlling your
life about 5% of the time.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
95% is coming from the program.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.530 align:middle line:84%
A psychologist recognized the
vast majority of these programs

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
are self-sabotaging,
disempowering, and limiting,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:90%
the programs that we get.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And why this becomes
relevant-- if 95% of your life

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:90%
is coming from those programs.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:84%
No wonder we have to struggle
to get through our lives,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:90%
to overcome.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the
most important fact

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that people have to
understand is this--

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:84%
the word "subconscious"
means below conscious.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you are operating from
the subconscious mind, when

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:84%
the conscious mind
is busy thinking,

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
you yourself don't
even see the program.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And why this is the
most important thing

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
to understand is, if the
program is self-sabotaging,

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
then it says 95% of the day,
you will sabotage yourself

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
with behavior that you
got from other people.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And you won't see
you're doing it,

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and that makes you feel you're
a victim of the universe.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I go forth in the morning
with wishes and desires--

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.508 align:middle line:84%
health, happiness,
great relationship.

00:12:17.508 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And I come home at
the end of the day

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.250 align:middle line:90%
finding I'm not getting there.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, when I
look at my life, I say,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I have the great
wishes and desires.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
not supporting me.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, no,
you just haven't recognized

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:84%
95% of the day, you've been
shooting yourself in the foot

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't
even seen the gun.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
problem comes from.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it says, we
are not running our lives.

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:84%
That the invisible control
autopilot subconscious

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:90%
is responsible for 95%.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.020 align:middle line:84%
If we understand
this, then there's

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.520 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to
look at your life.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Say, what's not working?

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.540 align:middle line:90%
I go, why is that not working?

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, not
because the universe

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want you
to have that, it's

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:84%
because your own program
is self-sabotaging.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
There's a simple understanding
about the nature of the mind.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The nature of the
mind is to create

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
coherence between your
beliefs and your reality.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And this makes
sense because what

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.450 align:middle line:84%
if your life didn't
match your beliefs?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Did that mean everyday
you would get up,

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.392 align:middle line:84%
and it's like oh my
god, everything's

00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:90%
going crazy around here.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out,
no, life pretty much

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:90%
matches what you think.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.625 align:middle line:84%
And you wake up every day and
you go through the process,

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, yep,
this is way life

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
is without recognizing it's that
way because we're manifesting

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:90%
it that way.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you change the program,
you recover the power.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.890 align:middle line:90%
And so simple point--

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:84%
people have seen the
movie, "The Matrix,"

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and they say, oh, that's
a science fiction movie.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And I go, no, "The
Matrix" is a documentary.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:90%
We've all been programmed.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:84%
The story of "The
Matrix" is, yes, you've

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:90%
been programmed to go, yes.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us
has been programmed

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.230 align:middle line:84%
because the first seven years,
the function of the brain

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:84%
is theta as the primary
activity, which is hypnosis.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And what I really want people
to understand very simply is,

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.770 align:middle line:84%
in the movie, "The
Matrix," there's

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
this opportunity
to take a red pill.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you take the red pill,
you get out of the program.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I want people to understand
that, yes, you've

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:84%
been programmed as "The
Matrix" says, and most of you

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.030 align:middle line:84%
have taken the red pill
at one time or another.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, when was that?

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.250 align:middle line:84%
I say, when you fall deeply
in love with somebody.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.583 align:middle line:90%
I say, it's taking the red pill.

00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:43.583 align:middle line:90%
I say, what do you mean?

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, the day
before you met this person,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.340 align:middle line:90%
your life could suck.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Everything is just not right.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I hate my life.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you meet this
person, and 24 hours later,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:84%
it's heaven on Earth that
you're so healthy and happy

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
and joy and everything
is beautiful.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Even that job that sucked
yesterday is like it's, OK.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And I go, the transition in that
24-hour period, the difference

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
is, when you fall in
love, you stop defaulting

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:90%
to the subconscious program.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.656 align:middle line:90%
You stay mindful.

00:15:14.656 --> 00:15:16.602 align:middle line:84%
Mindful means, no,
I'm keeping my hands

00:15:16.602 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:84%
on the wheel when I'm
driving and I'm not

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:90%
going to go into thought.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if I go in the
thought, I let go of the wheel.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So if I stay present,
I'm controlling it.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And I go, and so what was the
consequence of falling in love?

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was, you
created heaven on Earth,

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
even if it was just for a short
few days or a week or a month.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
The reality was,
what was different

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:84%
before you fell in love versus
what happened immediately

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:90%
after.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
An answer is, before you fell
in love, 95% of your life

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:84%
was coming from
subconscious programs.

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And the day you fall in
love, from that moment

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:84%
to the next period,
you were actually

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
driving your vehicle with your
conscious wishes and desires.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And when both
people are operating

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.610 align:middle line:84%
from wishes and desires
and not programs,

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.340 align:middle line:84%
together, they manifest
heaven on Earth.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:90%
So the simple line is this--

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
we are capable of
experiencing heaven on Earth.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is,
once we default back

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
to the subconscious, we are
not operating from our wishes

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:90%
and desires any longer.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
We are now operating from
the downloaded programs

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.570 align:middle line:84%
of limitation that we got
in the first seven years.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.438 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:25.438 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.310 align:middle line:84%
My research back in 1967
was cloning stem cells,

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:90%
which are embryonic cells.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I put one stem cell
in the dish by itself,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:90%
it divides every 10 or 12 hours.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So versus one, two,
four, doubling, doubling.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And after a week, 50,000
cells in a Petri dish.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.250 align:middle line:84%
The most important
point is, all the cells

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:84%
are genetically
identical because they

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.580 align:middle line:90%
came from one parent.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So I have 50,000
genetically identical cells.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I split them up into three
different Petri dishes,

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:90%
but I change the culture medium.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the environment
in which cells live.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I say, what is culture medium?

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:90%
It's equivalent of blood.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm growing mouse
cells, I look at mouse blood,

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:84%
see the composition, and in
the lab, synthesize culture

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:90%
medium based on that.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
When I grow human cells, I
look at human blood composition

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and culture medium
based on that.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:90%
The significance is this--

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I can change the composition
of the culture medium.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
So I have genetically identical
cells in three dishes,

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
but I change the
chemistry a little bit

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:84%
in each of the three
different dishes.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So in environment A,
the cells form muscle.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
In environment B,
genetically identical cells

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.310 align:middle line:84%
in a different
environment form bone.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And in environment
C, again, changing

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:84%
the chemical composition
of the culture medium,

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:84%
but with genetically
identical cells,

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:90%
the cells form fat cells.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.990 align:middle line:90%
So the fate of the cells--

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:84%
muscle, bone, fat--
wasn't based on genetics.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:90%
They all had the same genes.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:90%
It was based on the environment.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.895 align:middle line:84%
So they say, OK, cells
in a plastic Petri

00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
dish, culture environment,
what the heck does

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:90%
that have to do with me?

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.755 align:middle line:90%
And here's the answer--

00:18:04.755 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:84%
when you look in the
mirror and see yourself,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:90%
you see one human looking back.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:90%
And I go, oh, one organism.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.775 align:middle line:90%
I go, misperception.

00:18:11.775 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
A human is comprised
of 50 trillion cells.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:90%
The cells of the living entity--

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:84%
when I say the
word, "Bruce," that

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:84%
is a word that is covering
a community of 50 trillion

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:90%
individual sentient cells.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So the point is simple
and kind of funny.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:84%
A human being is a
skin-covered Petri dish.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Underneath your skin, you
have 50 trillion cells,

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and you have culture
medium called blood.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.638 align:middle line:90%
And I say, here's the point.

00:18:41.638 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make a difference
for the cell of it's

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:84%
in the plastic dish
or the skin dish.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
The fate of the cell is not
controlled by the genes,

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:84%
it's controlled by the
composition of the culture

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:90%
medium.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.170 align:middle line:84%
In your skin-covered Petri
dish, the culture medium's

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:90%
called blood.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:90%
And I say, yeah.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I say, and the
brain is the chemist

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.870 align:middle line:84%
that determines what is the
composition of that blood.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I lead off to the
next and most important fact.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:08.880 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, what
chemistry should

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:90%
the brain put into the blood?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, it's based on
the perception of the mind.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:90%
The interpretation of the mind.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:84%
If I open my eyes and
I see someone I love,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:84%
the brain releases
chemistry related

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.360 align:middle line:84%
to love, which is
dopamine-- pleasure;

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
oxytocin-- bonding
to the one I love.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Vasopressin-- a
chemical in my blood

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
that causes my cells to become
more attractive to my mate.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And growth hormone is
released when you're in love,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and that by the name says,
causes you to become healthy.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying, when the
mind perceives love,

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry from
that brain is chemistry

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:90%
that enhances your vitality.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why when people
are in love, they glow.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
You go, oh, look,
you can see they're

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:90%
in love how healthy they are.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:01.060 align:middle line:84%
The culture medium in a body
perceiving love is healthy.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
The same person, if
they open their eyes

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and see something
that scares them

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
will not release the same
chemistry as in love.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're afraid, you
release stress hormones

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and inflammatory agents that
affect the immune system.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So I say, oh, my goodness,
if I open up my eyes

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and I see something that
scares me, then cortisone

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and norepinephrine and
inflammatory agents

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:84%
called cytokines are released
into the culture medium--

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:84%
a different composition
of culture medium.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Point-- the fate of the cell
is dependent on the composition

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.850 align:middle line:90%
of the culture medium.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So as I change my
thought, the chemistry

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:84%
that comes from my brain is
correlated with a thought--

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
positive thoughts release
chemistry that enhances health.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Negative thoughts
release chemistry

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:90%
that put you into protection.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And the problem is this--

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:84%
growth and protection cannot
occur at the same time.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Growth is moving
toward something

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
you want to assimilate
into your life.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Moving towards something with
your arms open to take it in.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Growth is open, moving
towards the stimulus.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Protection is
completely opposite.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
If something's threatening
you, you don't move toward it,

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:90%
you move away from it.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And you don't keep
yourself open.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.304 align:middle line:84%
You wall yourself
off in protection.

00:21:18.304 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Point-- you can't be open
and closed at the same time.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't move forwards and
backwards at the same time.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.240 align:middle line:84%
You're either in growth
or you're in protection,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:90%
but you can't be in both.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, so what are the
problems of the world today,

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
and the answer is very simple.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:84%
This system was designed
a million year ago.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
That was when you needed
protection to run away

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:90%
from a saber tooth tiger.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Point-- tiger chases
you, you run away,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:90%
you get away, no more threat.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Then you're back in growth.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So protection was used
only for short intervals.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Today's world is
24/7, 365 stress.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Our biology was never designed
to be in perpetual stress.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:90%
I say, why is there a problem?

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
When a saber toothed
tiger is chasing me

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and I stopped my growth
mechanism for five or seven

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
minutes and shut down my
immune system for five or seven

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:90%
minutes to escape, I'm cool.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But in today's world, we
we're shutting down the growth

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:22.370 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms and interfering with
the immune system every day,

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:90%
all day.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Our system was never designed
to be in protection that much.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
As a result, we
compromise growth.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And the significance is, stress
shuts down growth and shuts

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:90%
down the immune system.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:84%
When you shut up
both of those down,

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:90%
stress results in illness.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:90%
How much illness?

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Over 90% of illness
on this planet

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
today is based on lifestyle
and stress and not genetics.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the story is, genetics
is responsible for little less

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:90%
than 1% of disease.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:90%
I go, why is it relevant?

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, yes, less than
1% of the population

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
can claim my ill health is
because I have bad genes.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what about the
90% of the population

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.620 align:middle line:84%
that is causing the
health care crisis?

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it had nothing to do
with the genes and everything

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:84%
to do with lifestyle
and behavior.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Relevance-- those are
things we can control.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, we could
eliminate the entire health

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:84%
care crisis on this
planet when people wake up

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
to the fact is if they take
back the power over their lives

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
and stop responding to the
media and in the belief

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:84%
that everything is falling apart
and we're all going to die,

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
you let go of that and you can
recover your health right away.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is, we
are very powerful.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.615 align:middle line:84%
It's only our belief that
is undermining our biology.

00:23:50.615 --> 00:23:53.822 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:53.822 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea that
belief is controlling us

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
fact of science

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that we're beginning
to recognize

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.720 align:middle line:84%
for the simple reason a belief
is connected to chemistry.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:84%
The chemistry of the brain
is a translation of a belief.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the relevance is, if
you have a negative belief,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
then the chemistry that
comes from that brain

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.130 align:middle line:84%
is not going to be positive
and support your health.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It's actually going to put you
in a protection mode, which

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in fact, walls you
off from health.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.230 align:middle line:90%
How powerful is belief?

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.840 align:middle line:90%
A person can be hypnotized.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I'm going to touch
you with a burning cigarette,

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and the hypnotist touches
them with a finger like that.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.065 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple of
minutes, that individual

00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
will have a blister
and a wheel and flare.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:90%
And the idea was what?

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.550 align:middle line:84%
The belief that they got
burned led to the blister.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the finger
didn't cause the blister.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:90%
The belief.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't just localize
the blister anywhere.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:84%
It got specifically localized
where you were touched.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
The belief is so
profound that it

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
can create a blister
from nothing more

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:90%
than the belief in a blister.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And so focused that it didn't
form the blister anywhere

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
except where you
actually touched it.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Once you start to
recognize that,

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
you start to see
how powerful belief

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is, it overrides the system
and how specific the belief is.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And why this
becomes important is

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
because many of the diseases,
like cancer, there's

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:84%
different kinds of cancer in
different parts of the body.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's not an
accident or a coincidence

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that a cancer is in
different parts of the body.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.780 align:middle line:84%
It's related to the belief
of those individuals

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
where that cancer
is going to show up.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, we
have to let people

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:84%
know how powerful they are
because your thoughts are going

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to take whatever that
belief is and manifest it

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:90%
to become a reality.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a belief of a
blister or the idea of cancer.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:58.150 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you're
going to have cancer,

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.380 align:middle line:90%
you can create cancer.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, less than 10% of
cancer is based on heredity.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:84%
90% of cancer is based
on lifestyle and belief.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have to give
people back power.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
The system's
unfortunately designed

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:84%
is to take advantage of
people by disempowering them.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
By saying, you have no
control over these things.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we are
going to rescue you.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:84%
You are a victim, and we,
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is going to rescue you
from this victimization.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.920 align:middle line:90%
And the truth is this--

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
if you're a victim, it's
nothing more than a victim

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.710 align:middle line:84%
of your belief, and
that you can change.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
you're not a victim.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
You're fully powerful,
except for your program

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:90%
says you are not powerful.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:51.030 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Beliefs are translated by the
brain into life experiences.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:90%
That's a simple fact.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.327 align:middle line:84%
If you have negative
beliefs about life--

00:26:59.327 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:84%
if you have a belief
that you're going

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to get a cancer
even or some disease

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:84%
or that life isn't
going to work out, well,

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:90%
that will be your manifestation.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is, what
beliefs do you want?

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.200 align:middle line:90%
What world do you want?

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance about that
is, when you fall in love,

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:90%
for example, you want this love.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I say, and look how your
life changed in a minute

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:84%
from falling in love
from what it was before.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So the reality is, a
vision can manifest,

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:84%
but that vision has
to be in control.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a conscious vision--
this is where we create from.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Conscious is wishes,
desires, aspirations.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So if I asked you, what do
you want from your life,

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.580 align:middle line:84%
the answer comes from
the conscious mind.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Then I say, yeah, but
here's the problem--

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
if the conscious mind is
only working 5% of the time,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.400 align:middle line:84%
what is the possibility of
manifesting that belief?

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.058 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
not very likely.

00:27:56.058 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
What you really want to do
is change the belief system.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:84%
This is so profoundly
important, because if you

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.710 align:middle line:84%
could change the belief system,
this would be a lousy message.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.002 align:middle line:84%
They'd say, I'm sorry, your
life is already programmed.

00:28:07.002 --> 00:28:08.293 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything about it.

00:28:08.293 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:90%
The fact is, no.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.100 align:middle line:90%
People change their beliefs.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And when they change
their beliefs,

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.100 align:middle line:90%
they empower themselves.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is
necessary for people

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.730 align:middle line:84%
to understand because we have
been systematically deprived

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.690 align:middle line:84%
of our power by saying, no,
genes control your life.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.490 align:middle line:90%
You don't control the genes.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you believe that,
then any story about your genes

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
will now manifest because
you bought the belief.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:90%
And we have to change this.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.684 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:39.684 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember that
the physiology of the body

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.112 align:middle line:84%
is based on the chemistry of
the blood, the culture medium.

00:28:49.112 --> 00:28:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And that the
chemistry of the blood

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.880 align:middle line:84%
is really a direct reflection
of the thoughts in our mind.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, if
we're going to have

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.890 align:middle line:84%
some kinds of negative
thoughts, anything

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.500 align:middle line:84%
you do to disrupt
those thoughts,

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
to remove those
thoughts, to replace them

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.940 align:middle line:84%
with positive thoughts,
every one of those events

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.680 align:middle line:84%
has an opportunity to change
the chemistry of your body,

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.170 align:middle line:90%
bringing it toward health.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Interesting point-- Dean Ornish,
a physician in San Francisco--

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.050 align:middle line:90%
wonderful study.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.480 align:middle line:84%
He worked with prostate
cancer patients.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.900 align:middle line:84%
What he did is he split his
patients into two groups.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Before the 90-day
experiment, they

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
read the genetics
of both populations.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And then one group got regular,
conventional pharmaceutical

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.460 align:middle line:90%
treatment.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The second group was
the experimental group.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And what did he do?

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:84%
He taught them stress
reduction techniques.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.520 align:middle line:84%
He taught them how to
meditate, and he taught them

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.000 align:middle line:90%
how to have a better diet.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And so for 90 days, one
group got regular treatment,

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.710 align:middle line:84%
the other got this special
meditation and diet change.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And after 90 days, they read
the genes of both groups.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:84%
The group that got the
conventional treatment,

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the genes essentially stayed the
same as they were for 90 days.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:84%
But the group that changed
lifestyle, 500 genes

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.930 align:middle line:84%
changed their
function in 90 days.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Most of the genes were
contributing to the cancer.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So basically they said,
what was the power of this,

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and the power was this--
just changing lifestyle,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
just changing diet, rewrote
the genetics of that individual

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.408 align:middle line:90%
and took them toward health.

00:30:23.408 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So basically, he
says, you don't need

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to do all kinds of hard things,
like change your chemistry

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and get injections and do all
kinds of physical manipulation.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Start with the mind.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:84%
The mind is the
ultimate control.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And you say, the mind
controls biology?

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I go, biology has
been telling us

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.270 align:middle line:84%
for 100 years about
the power of the mind.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.640 align:middle line:90%
It's called the placebo effect.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.310 align:middle line:84%
The placebo effect
is, oh, here's

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:52.070 align:middle line:84%
this powerful drug
that can cure--

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:55.580 align:middle line:84%
this powerful drug
can cure your disease.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And the person says, oh,
that's the one I want.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Take the drug, get better, find
out the drug was a sugar pill.

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:07.085 align:middle line:84%
The point was, then what cured
the disease of that individual,

00:31:07.085 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and the answer
was, not the pill.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.070 align:middle line:84%
What cured the
disease was the belief

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:84%
that the pill was going
to cure the disease.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.852 align:middle line:84%
So the belief I'm going to
get cured led to the cure.

00:31:18.852 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Now people understand
that, and they go, yes, I

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:22.010 align:middle line:90%
understand placebo effect.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.052 align:middle line:90%
That's positive thinking.

00:31:23.052 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:84%
I go, that's actually what
it is-- positive result.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:84%
What I need people understand
more importantly is this--

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:84%
we don't talk about what is the
concept of negative thinking.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh, negative thinking is
equally powerful in controlling

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:84%
your biology as
positive thinking

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.140 align:middle line:84%
but it works in the
opposite direction.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.470 align:middle line:84%
While a positive
thinking placebo effect

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:84%
can cure you of any
disease, a negative belief,

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:53.600 align:middle line:84%
called the nocebo effect,
can cause any disease.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
You can create any
disease with a belief.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And the relevance about
that is, we never talk

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.130 align:middle line:90%
about the negative beliefs.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I find out from
psychologists that 70% or more

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:84%
of our thoughts are negative and
disempowering and redundant--

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.550 align:middle line:90%
same beliefs.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And it says, all day long,
you are disempowering yourself

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.320 align:middle line:90%
with your belief--

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.060 align:middle line:90%
the nocebo effect.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And since nobody is really
aware of the nocebo effect,

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time for them to
wake up and recognize, yeah,

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.430 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I know the positive
thinking is very important,

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:28.010 align:middle line:84%
but, boy, you should
emphasize negative thinking

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:84%
is equally powerful but works
in the opposite direction

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:90%
from health.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:90%

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.890 align:middle line:84%
The new science about heredity
is called "epigenetics."

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:84%
It sounds almost the same as
the old science, "genetics,"

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's profoundly
different-- it's a revolution.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:84%
When I say "genetics"--
specifically,

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.560 align:middle line:84%
when I say "genetic control,"
which is a conventional belief,

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:84%
genetic control literally
means "control by genes."

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is the belief
that your heredity

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.120 align:middle line:90%
is going to control your life.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The new science is
called "epigenetics."

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like almost the
same, but the prefix "epi"

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.250 align:middle line:84%
is the revolution,
Epi means above.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So when I say "epigenetic
control," I'm literally saying,

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.690 align:middle line:90%
"control above the genes."

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.310 align:middle line:90%
This is the revolution--

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.360 align:middle line:84%
if genes control your life and
you don't control your genes--

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.460 align:middle line:90%
by definition, you're a victim--

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:29.420 align:middle line:84%
but in epigenetics, your
mind and your environment

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:90%
are what control your genes.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And since you're the one
that can regulate your mind

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and change your environment,
then we are not victims,

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:90%
we are masters.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.260 align:middle line:84%
We can change any of these
things and alter our genetics.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:90%
So this is the revolution.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is empowerment
for the people.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:90%

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems in
our medical profession

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
is the lack of understanding
about the relationship

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.170 align:middle line:84%
of programming in
the first seven years

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.850 align:middle line:90%
and the impact on our health.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
In the first seven
years, we start

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.445 align:middle line:84%
to identify how life works
and who controls what.

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to an average
family, when someone's

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.237 align:middle line:84%
sick in the family,
and say, oh, Billy's

00:34:11.237 --> 00:34:12.920 align:middle line:84%
sick-- we have to
take Billy the doctor.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Mommy is sick-- she has
to go to the doctor.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.750 align:middle line:84%
An infant in the
first seven years

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.719 align:middle line:84%
is learning what, if
it's a health issue,

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:84%
you don't take care
of it yourself,

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.260 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to the
doctor to take care of it.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.639 align:middle line:84%
So you're abdicating
control over your health

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and putting it on the
shoulders of the doctor.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.000 align:middle line:84%
So whatever the doctor's
opinion is becomes your truth.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So a diagnosis is
not just a diagnosis.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.690 align:middle line:84%
A diagnosis is actually
planning your future.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:44.989 align:middle line:84%
If this is what you expect
according to the diagnosis

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and you have the belief that
the doctor is the professional

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.050 align:middle line:84%
knows all this stuff, then
that belief is translated

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.290 align:middle line:90%
by your mind into the biology.

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is why if a
doctor tells a patient,

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, you have three
months left to live,

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:01.160 align:middle line:84%
that patient generally
lives about three months

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.200 align:middle line:90%
and then dies.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Was it because they had to
die at three months, or more

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:84%
importantly, was it
because the date was set,

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, the biology is
conforming to a program that

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.070 align:middle line:90%
already occurs.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what we have
to begin to understand

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:20.300 align:middle line:84%
that when we buy
professional opinion,

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.510 align:middle line:84%
then our mind
takes their opinion

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and then tries to create
reality based on that opinion.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
have given up power

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.120 align:middle line:84%
over your life and
these diagnoses

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:84%
without giving benefit
to the patient where

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:90%
they can change it.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunate because
they use the catch phrase,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:84%
"we don't want to give
false hope to the patient."

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, the
problem is this--

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.010 align:middle line:84%
then these diagnosis actually
offer no hope to the patient.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
saying that you

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:90%
don't have to have this fate.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:56.450 align:middle line:84%
You are telling-- this is what
the fate is and this unfolds.

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Angelina Jolie,
her mother and her grandmother

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:84%
died with the breast
cancer BRCA1 gene.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And she apparently
had that gene,

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
so to avoid that future cancer,
she has a double mastectomy.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.530 align:middle line:84%
As if, OK, if I
remove my breasts,

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:90%
I will not get breast cancer.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:90%
That's not true, actually.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.110 align:middle line:90%
But the fact was this--

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:84%
it was a belief
based on the fact

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:26.600 align:middle line:84%
that the BRCA1
gene causes cancer.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.610 align:middle line:84%
I need to correct
this right now--

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:84%
the BRCA1 gene does
not cause cancer.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.830 align:middle line:84%
50% of the women that have
the gene never get the cancer.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:39.920 align:middle line:84%
The point is very
critical that says,

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.470 align:middle line:84%
50% of the women with this
gene don't get cancer.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Then the gene is not
causing the cancer.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And why is this relevant
is because when people

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.650 align:middle line:84%
buy into the belief that the
gene causes cancer and then are

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.340 align:middle line:84%
told they have the gene, then
the belief system is going

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh my god, I'm
open to the cancer,

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm a victim
of the cancer.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.230 align:middle line:84%
This is an unfortunate
situation because it's still

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.370 align:middle line:90%
the belief system.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.470 align:middle line:84%
What science hasn't
studied is how

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:84%
come 50% of the women with
that gene don't get the cancer.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:90%
They don't study that.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the part you
really want to study

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.170 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
part that says,

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.030 align:middle line:84%
it's not the gene
that does that.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a problem
with the understanding

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.860 align:middle line:84%
of our conventional
genetics, and it

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.100 align:middle line:84%
deals with these two
words that get confused.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
The two words are "causation"
and "correlation."

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.800 align:middle line:90%
They're not the same.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Causation as the act
that produces something.

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Correlation means it's
connected with something.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.290 align:middle line:90%
There is no cancer gene--

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.280 align:middle line:90%
that's a fact.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, there is no
gene, you have this gene,

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:44.790 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get cancer.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:46.240 align:middle line:90%
The point is this--

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.880 align:middle line:84%
the so-called cancer genes
are correlated with cancer

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.640 align:middle line:90%
but do not cause the cancer.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is very critical
for people who get

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.360 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with having a gene.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.030 align:middle line:84%
If they believe the
gene causes cancer,

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:84%
then they're already
committed to the fact

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that I have the gene and
I have the cancer coming.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, please,
this is totally incorrect.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Having the gene does not
mean you got the cancer.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the lifestyle
that is out of harmony

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:19.610 align:middle line:84%
correlated with the gene
that gives you the cancer.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.890 align:middle line:84%
If your lifestyle is good,
the gene is irrelevant.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
any effect at all.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.800 align:middle line:84%
I need people to
disconnect from the concept

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:84%
of genetic determinism that
genes are causing these things.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom
conclusion is this--

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:41.120 align:middle line:84%
yes, genes can have an influence
on disease, but less than 1%

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.635 align:middle line:84%
of disease is
connected to genetics.

00:38:43.635 --> 00:38:46.420 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And the first seven years--

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.150 align:middle line:84%
the first seven
years because that's

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.500 align:middle line:84%
the part that looked
at subconscious mind.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.750 align:middle line:90%
So there's a joke--

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.987 align:middle line:84%
The joke that the doctor
is going to heal you.

00:39:02.987 --> 00:39:05.070 align:middle line:84%
The belief that you're
sick, you go to the doctor,

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:06.480 align:middle line:90%
and the doctor goes to heal you.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.046 align:middle line:84%
The joke is
interesting, and this

00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:11.275 align:middle line:84%
is this-- no one ever said
what the doctor had to do.

00:39:11.275 --> 00:39:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, Mommy's sick,
she has to go to the doctor.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
You're sick, you have
to go to the doctor.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Nobody said anything.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:18.480 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
go to the doctor.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:84%
The joke-- how many people get
well on the way to the doctor's

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:26.760 align:middle line:84%
office or sitting in
the doctor's office

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:90%
before they see the doctor?

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the point is, this is not
an accident or coincidence.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:90%
The fact is simple.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.272 align:middle line:84%
You are capable of
healing yourself.

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:37.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you put a belief
in the front that says,

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:84%
first I must go to the
doctor, which is interesting

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:84%
because I said, nobody said
the doctor had to do anything.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.430 align:middle line:90%
I have to go to the doctor.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:84%
By just going to the
doctor, you complete

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.830 align:middle line:84%
step one, which then
opens up self-healing,

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:52.470 align:middle line:90%
which is step two.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
interesting is

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.523 align:middle line:84%
that the idea of the doctor
doing the healing-- it's

00:39:58.523 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:90%
like, no, you just had to go.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
have anything done.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Just go.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And that will allow the system
to start healing itself.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.811 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:08.811 --> 00:40:12.675 align:middle line:90%


00:40:12.675 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a
simple reason why.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Fear as a concept,
as a consciousness,

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.170 align:middle line:84%
prepares a body for
fight or flight--

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:90%
protection.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.340 align:middle line:84%
To provide protection,
we get the blood

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.600 align:middle line:90%
to go to the arms and legs.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.690 align:middle line:84%
That's where adrenal
system, fight or flight.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Get ready to run.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:90%
Something is going to scare you.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.040 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, how does this work?

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is simply this--

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.720 align:middle line:84%
the concept of fear
releases stress hormones.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Stress hormones, when
going into the body,

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.803 align:middle line:84%
cause the blood vessels
in the gut to constrict.

00:40:48.803 --> 00:40:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is
what people feel

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.197 align:middle line:84%
as butterflies in the stomach
when they're first afraid.

00:40:53.197 --> 00:40:54.780 align:middle line:84%
What they're feeling
is the fluttering

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.923 align:middle line:90%
of blood vessels closing.

00:40:55.923 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, why should
the blood vessels close?

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, when the
blood vessels in the gut

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:02.730 align:middle line:84%
are closed, the blood
is preferentially

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.320 align:middle line:90%
sent to the arms and legs.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.410 align:middle line:84%
The blood is the energy
to allow us to run.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I say, oh, wait, the viscera
is growth and maintenance

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.210 align:middle line:90%
and taking care of your body.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in
a state of fear,

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.140 align:middle line:84%
you shut down the blood
vessels feeding the gut, which

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.900 align:middle line:84%
is taking care of your
biology and push the blood

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.980 align:middle line:90%
to your arms and legs.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.605 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
that happens in fear

00:41:24.605 --> 00:41:26.340 align:middle line:90%
is you shut down growth.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And you say, but I'm an
adult, I don't need to grow.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And I go, wait, every human
loses hundreds of billions

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:35.670 align:middle line:84%
of cells every day,
normal attrition.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Skin cells, hair cells,
bone cells, blood cells.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.980 align:middle line:84%
All cells are being replaced
at a periodic basis of hundreds

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.010 align:middle line:90%
of billions of cells per day.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
So I don't care what age
you are, you have to grow.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.802 align:middle line:84%
So the moment you're in
fear, the first thing

00:41:51.802 --> 00:41:53.010 align:middle line:90%
is, you shut down the growth.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, that opens you up
right now for sickness.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:59.980 align:middle line:84%
You're not replacing those
cells that are dying every day.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.935 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly, there
are two protection systems.

00:42:04.935 --> 00:42:06.810 align:middle line:84%
There's the adrenal
system-- fight or flight,

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.120 align:middle line:84%
protect me from that
saber tooth tiger.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.700 align:middle line:90%
But there's the immune system--

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.980 align:middle line:84%
that protects me from
internal threats.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I go, well,
why is this relevant?

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And I go, if you're being
chased by a saber tooth tiger

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
bacterial infection that

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:84%
could cause diarrhea,
how much energy

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.540 align:middle line:84%
are you going to put in
to fight the bacteria,

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and how much energy
you're going to put in

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.180 align:middle line:90%
to run away from the tiger?

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And the answer's pretty
no brainer answer--

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.430 align:middle line:84%
you put all the energy to
run away from the tiger.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Because if tiger catches
you, the bacteria

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:43.320 align:middle line:84%
is no longer a problem
in the first place.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I say, why is it relevant,
and here's the answer--

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:52.590 align:middle line:84%
when we are in fear,
stress, the stress hormones

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:90%
shut down the immune system.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:59.010 align:middle line:84%
It's so effective at shutting
down the immune system

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:02.760 align:middle line:84%
that doctors use stress
hormones therapeutically.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, if I want to
transplant a foreign organ

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:10.380 align:middle line:84%
into a recipient, I don't want
the recipient's immune system

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:12.420 align:middle line:90%
to reject that organ.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I give the recipient
stress hormones

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.060 align:middle line:90%
before transplanting the organ.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so effective
in shutting down

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.410 align:middle line:84%
the immune system,
it allows the organ

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:26.040 align:middle line:84%
to take hold before the
immune system activates.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're using stress
hormones therapeutically

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.300 align:middle line:84%
to shut down the
immune system, what

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.610 align:middle line:84%
does that mean for
the average person who

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.010 align:middle line:90%
is now living in stress 24/7?

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:38.790 align:middle line:84%
The answer is, we are inhibiting
our immune system every day.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.370 align:middle line:84%
That immune system is
responsible for preventing

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.940 align:middle line:84%
cancer, because everyday, normal
people create cancer cells,

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.580 align:middle line:84%
but a healthy immune system
will always get rid of it.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So every day, we
fight cancer when

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.600 align:middle line:90%
the immune system is working.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Every day, we fight what are
called opportunistic organisms.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us is infected,
no matter how healthy you are,

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:02.040 align:middle line:84%
you're already infected
with most human pathogens,

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.330 align:middle line:90%
but you say, I'm healthy.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, as long
as your immune system is

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:09.320 align:middle line:84%
running strong,
these organisms are

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.580 align:middle line:90%
called opportunistic organisms.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.640 align:middle line:84%
The immune system and
strength will prevent them

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.740 align:middle line:90%
from taking that opportunity.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:90%
But the idea is this--

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:24.510 align:middle line:84%
the immune system is suppressed
when we're in stress or fear

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.090 align:middle line:84%
because the energy used
by the immune system

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:30.840 align:middle line:84%
is so great that it will
interfere with us avoiding

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.372 align:middle line:90%
that saber tooth tiger.

00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about it.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.850 align:middle line:84%
When a person is sick,
they have so little energy

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.410 align:middle line:84%
they can't get out
of bed sometimes.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, the immune
system uses a lot of energy.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I said
being chased by the tiger,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.310 align:middle line:84%
having a bacterial
infection, where

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:46.560 align:middle line:90%
do you want your energy to go?

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.740 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's not the time to
fight the bacterial infection.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And so stress hormones
are shutting down

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.950 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the primary source
of the stress hormones.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So fear is driving
the health crisis

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:07.260 align:middle line:84%
that this planet is
experiencing because our media,

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.740 align:middle line:84%
our governments,
our military people

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.690 align:middle line:84%
are keeping us on
edge every day.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is causing a constant
drip of stress hormones

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.860 align:middle line:84%
that are constantly
suppressing us,

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.610 align:middle line:84%
and this is the cause of
today's health care crisis.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.879 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:26.879 --> 00:45:30.150 align:middle line:90%


00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:32.430 align:middle line:84%
We buy fear because of
people's programs that

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:34.180 align:middle line:90%
tell us we should be afraid.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.120 align:middle line:84%
We watch the TV,
we read the news,

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.060 align:middle line:90%
and fear is like everywhere.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Fear-- be afraid of these
people, be afraid of criminals,

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.640 align:middle line:90%
be afraid of terrorists.

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Be afraid, be afraid.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.340 align:middle line:84%
We are being programmed
to be afraid.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:52.800 align:middle line:84%
The significance is that it
weakens us because, remember,

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.260 align:middle line:84%
the stress hormones
shut down the growth

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and shut down the immune system.

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, we are
overtaken by a health care

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.250 align:middle line:90%
crisis.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:03.960 align:middle line:84%
But people also
don't recognize there

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.420 align:middle line:84%
is one other aspect of fear
that they must understand.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.650 align:middle line:90%
That is this--

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I said stress hormones
cause the blood vessels

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:84%
in the gut to
constrict because that

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.360 align:middle line:84%
pushes the blood to the
arms and legs so I can run.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.030 align:middle line:84%
People also don't
recognize this--

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that when you're in
fear and stressed,

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:23.520 align:middle line:84%
you don't use conscious
reasoning and logic.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why, the
same stress hormones

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.920 align:middle line:84%
that cause the blood vessels
to constrict in the gut,

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.130 align:middle line:84%
cause the blood vessels in
the forebrain, consciousness

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:36.120 align:middle line:84%
to constrict, which pushes the
blood to the hindbrain, which

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.440 align:middle line:90%
is reaction.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:39.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in
a stress response,

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:42.390 align:middle line:90%
consciousness is too slow.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:43.470 align:middle line:90%
It would slow you down.

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:45.720 align:middle line:84%
You'd be endangered if the
conscious mind had to deal

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.580 align:middle line:90%
with a stress situation.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why in stress,
the hormones shut down

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:84%
the blood vessels
and conscious brain

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and push us into reaction,
which is as fast as anything

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:57.330 align:middle line:90%
we can do.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But it makes us
less intelligent.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So fear not only dilapidates
our health system,

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.810 align:middle line:84%
but it creates a less
intelligent population.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
being a US citizen--

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and I have seen this fall
apart ever since 9/11,

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:17.400 align:middle line:84%
when fear was put
into the public.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.150 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:21.990 align:middle line:84%
In the first days
after 9/11, George Bush

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:84%
was on the television every
day telling the world--

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.690 align:middle line:90%
or the United States--

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:30.180 align:middle line:90%
be afraid, be very afraid.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Whoever these people are,
we don't know who they are.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Where they're coming
from, we don't

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.380 align:middle line:90%
know where they're coming from.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Where they're going
to hit, we don't know.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.778 align:middle line:90%
But be afraid.

00:47:37.778 --> 00:47:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what
was the consequence?

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.160 align:middle line:90%
I say, interesting point.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.320 align:middle line:84%
He said that for
three days in a row.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.140 align:middle line:84%
On the fourth day, he
changed his message.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:51.030 align:middle line:84%
On the fourth day, he said, hey,
America is open for business.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why he
had to say that was,

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:57.960 align:middle line:84%
for three days of fear, he shut
down the growth, not just of

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the bodies of the
people in the country,

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.280 align:middle line:84%
he shut down the growth
of the entire country,

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.950 align:middle line:84%
which is a living system
and put everybody on fear.

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And the economic system just
stopped still at that point.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And then he had to say,
no, no, don't be afraid.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he was trying
to sell fear and growth

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.830 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:19.020 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Ever since then,
the US has become

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:27.970 align:middle line:84%
one of the sickest countries in
the world and one of the more--

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:31.120 align:middle line:84%
one of the less intelligent
countries in the world.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're in fear,
we're not thinking and using

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.440 align:middle line:90%
conscious processing.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.090 align:middle line:90%
We're using reaction.

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And reaction, we
give up our power

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.380 align:middle line:84%
to somebody who's
got a big stick.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.170 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to protect us?

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:48.000 align:middle line:84%
If I'm afraid, let that
person with a big stick

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.430 align:middle line:90%
have all my power.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And the point is, as citizens
in this country, the fear,

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.130 align:middle line:84%
shutting down the
consciousness, has

00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.900 align:middle line:84%
led to what is called the
Patriot Act, which is actually

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.210 align:middle line:84%
something that's taken away
the rights of the citizens

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:05.820 align:middle line:84%
of the United States and
given the government the right

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:08.550 align:middle line:84%
to pick anybody off
the street if they feel

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.350 align:middle line:84%
they're a terrorist
and take them away

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.150 align:middle line:90%
without telling anybody.

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:15.360 align:middle line:84%
For 90 days, you can
disappear and not even know.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And I go, oh my god, why?

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:22.180 align:middle line:84%
People were so afraid, they
handed over the power and said,

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:24.720 align:middle line:90%
do whatever you need to do.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I look at this
country, and unfortunately,

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I have seen, yeah, we have
one of the biggest health care

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.580 align:middle line:90%
crises in Western countries.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And we are one of the less
intelligent of countries.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's very interesting.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:43.770 align:middle line:84%
British parliamentarian
Tony Benn spoke.

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said,
governments do not want

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:50.040 align:middle line:84%
a healthy,
intelligent population

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.710 align:middle line:84%
because they're
difficult to control.

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And I look at my own
country, I go, oh my god.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.040 align:middle line:90%
They succeeded.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, we have become
powerless in our own world

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:06.690 align:middle line:84%
because of the fear and
giving away our power.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.552 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:09.552 --> 00:50:14.232 align:middle line:90%


00:50:14.232 --> 00:50:16.190 align:middle line:84%
These are very interesting
times that the world

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:17.150 align:middle line:90%
is facing right now.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
because science

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is recognized as one
overriding crisis above all

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.480 align:middle line:90%
the other little crises.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we
are going extinct.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We are facing what is called
the planet's sixth mass

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.250 align:middle line:90%
extinction of life.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Five times in the history of
this planet, life was thriving,

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and then some event occurred,
and then life got wiped out

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and started over again.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Previous events are related to
things like comets or asteroids

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.450 align:middle line:84%
hitting the planet and
destroying the environment,

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:45.920 align:middle line:90%
wiping out life.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are losing
species of organisms

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:53.600 align:middle line:84%
faster than in the previous mass
extinctions, the previous five.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So by definition of
science, the loss of species

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.440 align:middle line:84%
reveals that we are now in the
sixth mass extinction of life.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.280 align:middle line:84%
The difference about this
one versus the previous one

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.940 align:middle line:84%
is that science is
also recognizing

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:10.820 align:middle line:84%
that human behavior is
responsible for the sixth mass

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.940 align:middle line:84%
extinction, which is not just
getting rid of other lifeforms,

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.220 align:middle line:90%
but is threatening our lives.

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The significance-- this
is not a million years

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.030 align:middle line:90%
or 1,000 years from now.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Within 100 years, we could lose
civilization on this planet.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So it says, human
behavior is causing this.

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And I go, OK, then
to get out of it,

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.350 align:middle line:90%
we must change human behavior.

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the only way out.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So the significance
is, the culture

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that we have been
living in is based

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.560 align:middle line:84%
on beliefs that are actually
undermining our health

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:41.810 align:middle line:90%
and sabotaging our environment.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:45.470 align:middle line:84%
That we must get outside
of the current system

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and create a whole new belief
system to operate from.

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.100 align:middle line:84%
So as I look at the
current situation,

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.770 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh, interesting.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Civilization as we know it
is about to come to an end.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited
by this because it

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.030 align:middle line:84%
says if it doesn't
come to an end,

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.630 align:middle line:84%
the future is much bleaker than
I could ever tell you about.

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:10.040 align:middle line:84%
The only way to thrive is
to stop the old behavior

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.080 align:middle line:90%
and move into a new realm.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.050 align:middle line:84%
The major bridge
is the bridge that

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:18.260 align:middle line:84%
takes us from being
victims of a world,

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.000 align:middle line:84%
to recognizing we are
creators of the world.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.800 align:middle line:84%
We're creating this
and that we have power.

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And people have
seen these powers

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and attribute it to,
oh, that's interesting.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes, people are walking
across hot coals or the number

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:37.730 align:middle line:84%
of pictures that I show in my
lectures of women lifting up

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:40.860 align:middle line:84%
cars because a child is
caught underneath it.

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And I compare it to a
weightlifter who is struggling,

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:84%
muscles bulging, and sweating
trying to lift up a car.

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And then here's a picture of a
young woman who held the car up

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:54.080 align:middle line:90%
because her child was under it.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, how can this be?

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, we are more
powerful than we think we are.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And because we don't
believe in our power,

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.050 align:middle line:84%
then we don't exercise our
powers based on belief.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:09.050 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you are
frail and vulnerable,

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:11.530 align:middle line:90%
you are frail and vulnerable.

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:13.723 align:middle line:90%
And so the issue is this--

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:15.140 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of
thousand years, we

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:18.180 align:middle line:84%
have been disempowered
intentionally.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.310 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I say, we're all
equally powerful people.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Then I say, well, how do
individuals in this world

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.530 align:middle line:84%
express so much more
power than others?

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I go, they don't
express more power.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.880 align:middle line:84%
What they've done is
taken away our power.

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we become the vulnerable,
frail ones, not because we are,

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:43.350 align:middle line:84%
but because we believe
in our lack of power.

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:45.080 align:middle line:90%
So the evolution says this--

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.090 align:middle line:90%
time to take your power back.

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:50.677 align:middle line:84%
You are so powerful in
creating, not just what's

00:53:50.677 --> 00:53:52.760 align:middle line:84%
going on in the outside
of the world, what's going

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.470 align:middle line:90%
on in the inside of your body.

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:59.510 align:middle line:84%
You are controlling and creating
this experience that we're in.

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you doubt
that, then go back

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.410 align:middle line:84%
and consider when
you fell in love.

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And I say, what was your life
like before you fell in love,

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and what was it like immediately
after you fell in love?

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's two
different worlds.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, because it was
two different belief systems.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to see
what the difference is,

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.420 align:middle line:84%
you can recognize that
world of heaven on Earth

00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:22.730 align:middle line:84%
is actually available
to every one of us

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:24.800 align:middle line:90%
once we get out of the programs.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.950 align:middle line:84%
The programs have
systematically disempowered us.

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Originally, we were
disempowered by religion,

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.600 align:middle line:84%
because they said you are not
able to communicate with God.

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.100 align:middle line:90%
You are separate from them.

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.840 align:middle line:90%
We will do the communication.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.930 align:middle line:84%
It will only cost
you this much money.

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.610 align:middle line:84%
The fact is this,
from an understanding

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:45.860 align:middle line:84%
of quantum mechanics
and new cell biology,

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:48.500 align:middle line:84%
nobody is ever disconnected
from the creator.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.290 align:middle line:84%
We're all pieces of the
creator from the biology.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So nobody needs to get
between you and the creator.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:58.250 align:middle line:84%
But when the church fell,
a new power group took over

00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:00.080 align:middle line:84%
and that was called
the medical industry.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, no, you
have no power over your health.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.390 align:middle line:84%
You're a victim and
we will rescue you.

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:08.150 align:middle line:90%
So we gave up power again.

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's time to get
both those powers back.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:13.890 align:middle line:84%
We have absolute power over
our health, our genetics,

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:15.670 align:middle line:90%
and what happens in our biology.

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have absolute
power in being co-creators

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:20.700 align:middle line:90%
of the world in which we live.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And when people
recover their power,

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:24.960 align:middle line:90%
the world will change instantly.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the average
person on this planet

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:31.440 align:middle line:84%
wants the same thing as
every other average person--

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:37.420 align:middle line:84%
safety, some food, a
job, a place to live.

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea is,
that's the massive number

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.400 align:middle line:90%
of the population--

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.110 align:middle line:90%
90% of the people.

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.690 align:middle line:84%
But because they've
been disempowered,

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.540 align:middle line:84%
they're not
experiencing that life.

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:53.490 align:middle line:84%
By taking back the power,
we can then recover that.

00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And heaven on Earth would not
be just a short little visit

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.200 align:middle line:90%
on a honeymoon.

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:03.028 align:middle line:84%
Heaven on earth is a way of
life for all of us every day

00:56:03.028 --> 00:56:04.320 align:middle line:90%
that we're here on this planet.

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.670 align:middle line:90%
