00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So my father taught me
visualization when I was 10

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.090 align:middle line:90%
years old.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.798 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I had very
bad migraine headaches.

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:21.090 align:middle line:90%
I used to get them every night.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And aspirin wouldn't work,
and nothing would work.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'd spend hours in
a dark room in pain.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And my father was a dentist,
and he used visualization

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
for pain management
with his clients.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.355 align:middle line:84%
So he took me on this
kind of adventure.

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:36.605 align:middle line:84%
What he did was he relaxes--
here, I'm going to relax.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's relax your
head and your legs.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And we went through
this relaxation process.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.612 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'd
like you to imagine

00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that you're at the top of this
ski slope we used to ski at.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.445 align:middle line:84%
Our favorite ski
slope was called

00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:49.672 align:middle line:90%
Waterville Valley, Valley Run.

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to imagine you're
at the top of this ski slope

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.133 align:middle line:84%
and you've got this big bucket
of black sand on your shoulder.

00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going
to ski down slowly.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful day.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to spill
the black sand as you ski.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we got about
halfway down the slope,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.100 align:middle line:84%
he said, OK, the sand is
about halfway empty now.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, the sand
is your headache.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.655 align:middle line:84%
And the more it spills
out, the more your

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:90%
headaches going to go away.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And my headache was about
halfway gone at that time.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.025 align:middle line:84%
And then we gradually
went through,

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and there was this
beautiful adventure.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.233 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
relaxing and soothing.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
We got down to the
bottom of the hill.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:90%
The sand was gone.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said, now
your headache's gone.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Open your eyes and you'll see
that your headache's gone.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I opened my eyes.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:90%
My headache was gone.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
It was the only thing that
ever cured my headaches.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:90%
It was miraculous.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
learned to do it myself.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:84%
It took me about 20 minutes
to get into the relaxed state

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and do the
visualization, and I was

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:90%
able to get rid of the headache.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And then he taught me
this other technique,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.833 align:middle line:90%
where if you're having--

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
when you have a
migraine headache,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have it on one
side of your head of the other.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.785 align:middle line:84%
So if it's on your
left side, you

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:53.943 align:middle line:84%
imagine your left hand
getting really, really hot.

00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And I would imagine my left
hand getting really hot.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'd imagine the headache
going into my left hand.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And my hand would get hotter,
and the headache would go away.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.837 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
got so good at it--

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:90%
so this went on for years.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.378 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
got so good at it

00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that whenever I was
about to get a headache,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I would touch my finger
to the part of my head

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.100 align:middle line:84%
where I was going
to have a headache

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and I would just imagine
that the headache was

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:90%
going into my finger.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel it going,
and I'd just flick it away.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I never
got migraines again.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And once or twice in
the last 30 years,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten the
signs of a migraine.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I do this thing,
and it would just go.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.597 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:32.597 --> 00:02:33.965 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:36.987 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so visualization was
a really important part

00:02:36.987 --> 00:02:38.070 align:middle line:90%
of my weight loss journey.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I had tried to lose
weight for years.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.685 align:middle line:90%
I met with Dr. Atkins.

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I went to the
Pritikin Institute.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I tried every diet
you can imagine.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:90%
I just kept gaining and gaining.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
was over 400 pounds

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:90%
and I had given up entirely.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, I decided
to apply visualization

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:90%
to my weight loss.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I did,
everything changed.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.080 align:middle line:90%
I was over 400 pounds.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I had a vivid image of
how I wanted to look.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I imagined myself with stomach
muscles, tight skin and stomach

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.690 align:middle line:90%
muscles, and looking great.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And every night as I went to
sleep, I'd have this image.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.283 align:middle line:90%
And things started to change.

00:03:13.283 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't as hungry
during the day.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't craving junk food.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I started finding people
that could help me

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and programs that-- everything
started to work after that.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And over a 2 and
1/2 year period,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I lost all the weight
that I had gained.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.690 align:middle line:90%
And I lost 220 pounds.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And I looked exactly the way
I had imagined myself looking

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.180 align:middle line:84%
down to a T, and I
just can't believe

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
that it's a coincidence.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Because it was just exactly the
shape and the form that I had

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.207 align:middle line:90%
imagined being.

00:03:41.207 --> 00:03:45.183 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So visualization is using
the language of symbols.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And to me, symbols
are the universal form

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.015 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
communicate with someone

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't speak
your language,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.830 align:middle line:90%
you're going to use symbols.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
just landed in China

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and you want to know
where the bathroom is,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
look for a symbol.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to look for
a symbol of the men's

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:84%
room or the woman's
room, and that's

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
how you know where
the bathroom is.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.233 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you communicate
with someone when-- that

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:90%
doesn't speak your language.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.108 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about the body,

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
we see the body
mostly as a machine.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But the body isn't
really a machine.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.653 align:middle line:84%
The body is living
consciousness.

00:04:18.653 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know how
to communicate with it.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't speak English.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.043 align:middle line:84%
We can't say to it,
"I want to lose weight

00:04:24.043 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
because in six months I want
to look good for my wedding."

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.750 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't
understand a wedding.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't understand
six months.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't understand English.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
problems that we all have,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even
know we have, is

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how to
communicate with our own animal

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
brain, our own physical
consciousness brain.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But when you use symbols,
you're bridging that gap.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you make a vivid
image of exactly the way

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:90%
you'd like to look--

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.920 align:middle line:84%
or if you're doing
sports, a vivid image

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
of exactly the way you'd
like your body to perform--

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.277 align:middle line:84%
you're communicating
to your body.

00:04:54.277 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And all the changes
are taking place--

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:84%
so the neuronal changes,
the hormonal changes.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything is changing
because you've now

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.127 align:middle line:84%
been able to communicate
with your body.

00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why visualization
is so powerful.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.415 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:08.415 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So to me, visualization is the
creative principle of life.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think we've
just all lost that.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I think in indigenous
cultures all around the world,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:90%
they all use visualization.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And as a kid, we used
dream, we used imagination,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:90%
we used that creative faculty.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is the
creative faculty of life.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It is the way to set the
dials of the automatic pilot,

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:90%
if you're in a plane.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like setting
the dials of your life.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.478 align:middle line:84%
When you visualize
where you want to be,

00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:90%
you're setting the dials.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
When you visualize how
you want your day to be,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
how you want to
perform in sports,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.877 align:middle line:84%
how healthy you
want to be, you're

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%
using that creative principle.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:90%
We haven't tapped into that.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's ours.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.750 align:middle line:84%
We lost it somewhere
along the way,

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.453 align:middle line:90%
but it belongs to all of us.

tennis legend Billie Jean King--
they all use visualization.

00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Tiger Woods' father taught
him how to use visualization.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
He says that every time
before he hits the ball,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.628 align:middle line:84%
he visualizes where
he wants it to go.

00:06:22.628 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
when he was a bodybuilder,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
he visualized exactly how
he wanted his body to look.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.977 align:middle line:84%
If his biceps-- he
wanted his biceps bigger,

00:06:28.977 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:90%
he visualized his biceps bigger.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
He'd visualize himself up
on stage winning the Mr.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Olympia, the Mr. Universe.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
When he was an actor, he
visualized being an actor

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.035 align:middle line:90%
and just crushing it.

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:84%
When he was in
politics, he used it.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.857 align:middle line:84%
In everything he did,
he used visualization.

00:06:42.857 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he's always
been successful at the things

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.768 align:middle line:84%
that he's been focused on
because he's using this power.

00:06:49.768 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So many different experts in
so many different fields--

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.270 align:middle line:90%
also actors.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
There's the story
of Jim Carrey, where

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.390 align:middle line:84%
he was a starving actor and
he wrote a check for himself

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:90%
for $10 million dollars.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
He dated it three years in the
future and said "For acting

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:90%
services rendered."

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.555 align:middle line:84%
Three years later, he got
a check for $10 million

00:07:07.555 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:90%
for the movie "Dumb and Dumber."

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Exactly three years to the
day-- it's unbelievable.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:90%
I know a little bit.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Carl Lewis would
imagine going through the tape

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.710 align:middle line:90%
That would be his thing.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So he used to program that
before he'd go to sleep.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And when he'd do his
own little practices,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
he'd imagine breaking
the tape first.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And then just as he's
lining up to do the race,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.290 align:middle line:84%
he'd see himself
breaking the tape first.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And that was his thing.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Michael Jordan always
would visualize himself

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
at night getting the ball
in one after the other, one

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.085 align:middle line:90%
after the other.

00:07:44.085 --> 00:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Before he's about
to take a shot,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:90%
he can just see it going in.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Muhammad Ali, just one of the
world's greatest in every way,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
would see himself
knocking on his opponent.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
He would visualize it
over and over again.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Arnold Schwarzenegger,
even when he did a speech

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:84%
as a politician, before
he did the speech

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:00.250 align:middle line:84%
he would visualize
it over and over

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and over and over, just getting
up there, doing the speech,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.180 align:middle line:90%
and just killing it.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:90%
And he did that in every aspect.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just that when you learn
that visualization is the way--

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.568 align:middle line:84%
the thing that you need to do
to succeed and how easy it is

00:08:13.568 --> 00:08:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and how you get better
and better at it, you just

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.592 align:middle line:90%
keep doing it.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.580 align:middle line:84%
When you understand
the language of symbols

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and how powerful
visualization is,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.932 align:middle line:84%
you understand how detrimental
negative self-talk is.

00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if you want
to lose weight,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.079 align:middle line:84%
for example, and you look
at yourself in the mirror

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:35.079 align:middle line:90%
and you go, "Oh, my god.

00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:90%
You're so fat," what do you see?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:90%
What's the image that you see?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.206 align:middle line:90%
You see yourself fat.

00:08:39.206 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:84%
Then you're communicating
to your body

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.673 align:middle line:84%
that that's the way
you're meant to look.

00:08:42.673 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you're looking
in the mirror and you say,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:90%
"You know what?

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.000 align:middle line:90%
You're beautiful.

You can do this.

You are effortlessly
thin," you're

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
making an image inside your
head of someone who's beautiful,

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
of someone who's fit,
of someone who's thin.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:90%
And you're communicating.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
You're using the
power of visualization

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.140 align:middle line:84%
to communicate to your body that
that's what you're meant to be.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.355 align:middle line:84%

way instead of a negative way.

There's some amazing
studies that have come out

00:09:11.287 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:90%
about the power of belief.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.162 align:middle line:84%
And they've come out
from the oddest place,

00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and that is from
pharmaceutical companies

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:84%
using placebos and trying to
beat the placebo for whatever

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:90%
drug they have.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And what they're finding is
not how powerful their drug is,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
but how powerful beliefs are.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, there have
been studies where they do--

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
they're testing
the effectiveness

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.063 align:middle line:90%
of an antidepressant.

00:09:33.063 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the antidepressant
is supposed

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to raise dopamine levels.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So they have one group
where they give them

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the antidepressant and another
group where that's not--

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:90%
it's a placebo.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
It means that they're
just given a sugar pill.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Not only do those people--

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
are those people no
longer depressed,

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:90%
their dopamine levels raise.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
actually thought--

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:84%
that just from the
power belief, they

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
thought a specific
neurotransmitter

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.550 align:middle line:90%
would get elevated.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to elevate
a specific neurotransmitter

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
simply by the power
of their belief.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Another amazing study that
came out was with knee surgery.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.860 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to test one
knee surgery versus the other.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.115 align:middle line:84%
So they had-- one group
had one knee surgery.

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:84%
The other group had a
different knee surgery.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And a third group
had no knee surgery,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:84%
but thought they
had knee surgery.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.093 align:middle line:84%
And that group recovered
just as well, if not better,

00:10:20.093 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
than the ones that
had the knee surgery.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Just because they thought
they had knee surgery,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
heal themselves simply

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
through the power
of their beliefs.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.733 align:middle line:84%
The power of placebo on
beliefs is so amazing

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:84%
that that's really what
we should be studying,

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:90%
and we're not studying that.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is
we're bumping into it.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Every time a pharmaceutical
company wants to beat a study,

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:90%
it bumps into it.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But we should be studying
how powerful beliefs are.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.872 align:middle line:84%
There was another study
with chemotherapy.

00:10:46.872 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to test the
effectiveness of chemotherapy.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.393 align:middle line:84%
And they had-- one group
had the chemotherapy.

00:10:51.393 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Another group thought they
were getting chemotherapy

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:90%
but weren't.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
The group that thought they
were getting chemotherapy,

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:90%
30% of them lost their hair.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.598 align:middle line:84%
They lost their hair
because they thought

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:90%
they were getting chemotherapy.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.410 align:middle line:84%
With the power of our
beliefs, we have the power

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
to lose hair simply because we
think that we're supposed to,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
we have the power to
raise dopamine levels

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:90%
to heal surgery.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.690 align:middle line:84%
All of these different
things we can

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
do with the power of our mind,
and no one is studying it.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Our beliefs, our power in our
beliefs and in the way we think

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
is so unbelievable, and
it's completely untapped.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is looking at it.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing is
when you learn visualization,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
you learn how to
change your beliefs,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.378 align:middle line:84%
but also instill the beliefs
very, very powerfully.

00:11:38.378 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you believe you're
going to be really successful,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be the
champion, you're going to win,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and you really believe
it and you have the power

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
to instill those beliefs
with visualization, that's

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:90%
a combination for success.

And his mom says, "Where
are you going, hun?"

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, "I'm going
to the Olympics, mom."

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, "Oh, well, you
better take your medal box

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.885 align:middle line:90%
to put your medals in."

00:12:08.885 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, he believed
it, and he believed it,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and he believed it, and he
became an Olympic ski jumper.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:17.387 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:17.387 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So the way I learned
visualization, you know,

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle line:84%
my father put me in
a very deep state.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.738 align:middle line:90%
And I actually learned later--

00:12:26.738 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
many years later--
that I was getting

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
into what's called the
alpha and the theta

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And in the alpha and the
theta states of consciousness,

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
you're much more focused
and your brainwaves

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:90%
are much more powerful.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Because they're more
powerful, you're

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
able to make brain
connections better.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
What makes you good at something
is repetition or practice.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.485 align:middle line:84%
If I were to juggle
for the first time,

00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:48.318 align:middle line:84%
the balls would be going
all over the place.

00:12:48.318 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
If I did it every
single day for 10 years,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I could do it while
talking, walking.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:90%
It's practice.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:90%
You're making brain connections.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Every time you try
to do something,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:84%
you're making a
brain connection.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in the
alpha and the theta

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness and
you try to do something,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:90%
you are then--

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
you are making brain
connections much, much quicker.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So what might take you
years of daily practice

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
you can do in days when you're
in the alpha and theta state.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when you look
at the Olympic athletes

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and the basketball players that
are doing these visualizations

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.597 align:middle line:84%
where they're imagining
taking the shot over

00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and over again or imagining
doing their sport over

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and over again, and
they're in that deep alpha

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and theta state, they're making
those brain connections so

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.233 align:middle line:84%
quick that it's actually a more
effective form of rehearsal

00:13:30.233 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:84%
than actually doing
the sport sometimes.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.265 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:36.265 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So you know, as
kids we are normally

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.270 align:middle line:84%
in this deep state, a dream
state, this alpha and the theta

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:90%
We get into it really easy.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.683 align:middle line:90%
And then we learn that--

00:13:47.683 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
we unlearn that
because, you know,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
our teacher says stop
dreaming, state focused.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:90%
So we lose that.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
But getting-- learning how to
get back into that dream state

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
is the key to being
successful in visualization--

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:84%
so learning how
to relax yourself.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.955 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
in visualization

00:14:01.955 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
is you want to know
how to relax yourself.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can breathe deep, do
just a simple meditation.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
I like to use the
imagery of light.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:84%
I imagine light going
through my body.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.212 align:middle line:84%
And as I learned later
in life, imagining

00:14:14.212 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:84%
light going through
your body is actually

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
opening up your invisible
life force channels.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And that puts you in a deeper
and more powerful state.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:90%
So I imagine light--

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.968 align:middle line:84%
I breathe-- you can breathe
light into your belly

00:14:23.968 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:90%
and breathe it out again.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.950 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine light
going all through your body

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and relaxing and healing
every place it touches.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.915 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point
when you do that--

00:14:32.915 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:84%
it might take you a
couple of minutes,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.240 align:middle line:90%
it might take you longer--

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
feel really relaxed.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to want
to--you're not fidgeting

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:38.960 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Then you're in a deeper state.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're not-- your
mind's not fidgeting either.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:84%
That's the time to
do visualization.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you do it
then, it just imprints.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:90%
You just get it.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.317 align:middle line:84%
So then you want
to imagine or feel.

00:14:50.317 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily--
you don't have to see it.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.483 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when you
first learn visualization,

00:14:54.483 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%
you can't see it.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.437 align:middle line:84%
It's a skill that you get
better and better at over time,

00:14:58.437 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:90%
but you can feel it.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
You can feel what it feels to
run faster than the other guy

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
or to have the weight
melting off of your body

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.837 align:middle line:84%
or to achieve whatever
athletic performance.

00:15:07.837 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:90%
You can feel what it feels like.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.330 align:middle line:90%
You can hear the crowd shouting.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the wind on your
face as you're running by.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine
different things.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, by using as much
of your senses as possible--

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:84%
what it feels like,
what it looks like,

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
what it smells like,
what it sounds like--

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
by using all those senses
when you're in the scene,

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
then you're imprinting into
all of your different neurons

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.155 align:middle line:84%
the specific desired
result that you want.

00:15:32.155 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And they've done
a lot of studies

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
where, when an athlete does
visualization, the muscles,

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:84%
neurons, nerves,
they're all firing

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:84%
in the exact same
coordinated sequence

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.793 align:middle line:84%
as if you're actually
doing the sport.

00:15:45.793 --> 00:15:50.523 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:50.523 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of ancient medical
traditions such as Chinese

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and Indian, the very foundation
of their medical philosophy

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is that we have an invisible
energy that animates

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:90%
us called life force energy.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They call it chi, they call it
prana, but it's our life force.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the difference between
a live body and a dead body.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:90%
A live body has life force.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And that life force is--
then animates the body

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and allows it to move.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.352 align:middle line:84%
Now that life force is
moved through our thoughts

00:16:20.352 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and through our visions
and through our images.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We can move that life force with
visualization, with thoughts.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And a simple experiment--

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I can just prove it to you.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.983 align:middle line:84%
If I basically-- if I just
try to move my finger,

00:16:31.983 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:90%
right, it's a thought.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.697 align:middle line:84%
A thought is not visible,
is not a physical thing.

00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Using the power of
my thought-- boom--

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.510 align:middle line:90%
I've just moved my finger.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:39.493 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:16:39.493 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to eastern
medicine what's happening

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:90%
is a thought is a vibration.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.020 align:middle line:90%
It's an invisible energy.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's not strong
enough to move matter

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.180 align:middle line:84%
so you need this interface--
this life force energy then

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:84%
gets vibrated by the thought,
which then is strong enough

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to move the electrons in your
neurons, which then creates

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:84%
this cascade of movement through
muscles and nerves and things.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's the life force
energy that moves--

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:90%
it moves us.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's the mind that
moves the life force energy.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So you-- learning how
to do visualization,

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:84%
you are learning how
to move your life force

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.425 align:middle line:90%
energy through your body.

00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And as you learn to
move the life force

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
energy through your body,
you can heal your body,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.572 align:middle line:84%
you can strengthen
your body, and you

00:17:15.572 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:90%
can revitalize your body.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned over the years
is that this invisible life

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.470 align:middle line:90%
force energy is everywhere.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.623 align:middle line:84%
And there's no limit
to how much of it

00:17:23.623 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:84%
you can channel
through your body,

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
except for the fact
that the channels--

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
they're called
acupuncture meridians,

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
or they're called nadis
in Indian tradition.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.120 align:middle line:84%
The channels that hold this life
force energy can get blocked.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
They can get
blocked from toxins.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
They can get blocked from
negative thoughts, from fears.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.670 align:middle line:84%
We block it and then
literally we cut ourselves off

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.470 align:middle line:90%
from life force.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.290 align:middle line:90%
We are de-vitalized.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:90%
Our vitality can't flow.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can use your mind in
visualization to guide the life

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
force energy through
all the different life

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:84%
force channels in your body
and, by doing so, unblock them.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you become a channel
to unlimited life force energy.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:90%
It just can flow through you.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And you can then use that to
achieve the greatness that you

want to achieve in the world.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's been some really
cool studies with visualization.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
There's an Australian
researcher, Alan Richardson.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
He took three groups
of basketball players.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
One group did free throws for 20
minutes every day for 30 days.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:31.045 align:middle line:84%
One group imagined doing
free throws for 20 minutes

00:18:31.045 --> 00:18:31.920 align:middle line:90%
everyday for 30 days.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And another group did nothing.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So the group that
did free throws

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:90%
every day got 24% better.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.870 align:middle line:84%
The group that imagined
doing free throws

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.550 align:middle line:84%
got 23% better
just by imagining.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.440 align:middle line:84%
They didn't shoot a single
hoop and they got 23% better.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the group that didn't,
they didn't get any better.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.272 align:middle line:84%
So simply by imagining
doing your free throws,

00:18:54.272 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:90%
they were able to get better.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And then there was another
study with weightlifters,

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:84%
where they had one group doing
a certain amount of weight

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.188 align:middle line:84%
lifting every day and another
group just imagining they

00:19:04.188 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:90%
were doing weightlifting.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
They didn't lift
a single weight.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And then another third
group that didn't.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:84%
The group that lifted
every day, they

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.270 align:middle line:84%
got 20-some-odd
percent stronger.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:84%
The group that imagined lifting,
but didn't lift a single pound,

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:84%
got 13% stronger
simply by imagining.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the other group
didn't get any stronger at all.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And what they
found in that study

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.543 align:middle line:84%
was that the group that
imagined lifting weights, all

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:31.960 align:middle line:84%
their muscles and neurons were
being fired as if they were

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:90%
actually lifting the weights.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.165 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.165 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So as a result of the
visualization that I've done,

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:84%
I started doing a
lot of meditating.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.535 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is when
you get into that relaxed state,

00:19:46.535 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to leave it.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of became
addicted to it.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to
become addicted to anything,

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.220 align:middle line:90%
become addicted to meditation.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So I've become
addicted to meditation,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and I spend hours a
day doing it sometimes.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But what I learned
is that it actually

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:90%
can increase your intuition.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And the intuition,
to me, I've come

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
to realize is like
another sense.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a sense that can make
you aware of the future

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
or aware of what's
happening around you that's

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.298 align:middle line:90%
not physically in your space.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
a lot of science

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to support the concept that
an intuitive sense would

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:90%
be a valid sense.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is that we know
that time doesn't exist.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So according to
quantum physics, we

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:90%
know that time does not exist.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.340 align:middle line:84%
That is that our mind
and our five senses

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
give us this illusion
of the world that's

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:90%
not really accurate.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Our mind tells us there's a
past, a present, and a future,

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:90%
and that's all we know.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.697 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physics tells
us that there is not a past,

00:20:41.697 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:90%
present, and future.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:84%
There is an eternal present and
it's all happening right now,

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:90%
but we can't see it.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:90%
Now why can't we see it?

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:84%
We can't see it because
we don't have the sense

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:84%
to see it the same way
that we can't see x-rays,

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:84%
we can't see radio
waves, we can't

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%
hear frequencies that are
above the auditory spectrum,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
we can't taste
things that are not

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:90%
within our taste bud spectrums.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have this limited
version of reality.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that we can't see

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
is the reality that all
time is happening right now.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
But what I have learned
is that meditation allows

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:90%
you to develop that sense.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people call
it a "sixth sense."

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Because we have five
senses, it's a sixth sense.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why meditation
develops your intuition

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:29.560 align:middle line:84%
or your sixth sense is because
you are giving yourself

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:90%
an opportunity to strengthen it.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:84%
The analogy that I always use
is a kid who has a lazy eye.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So if a kid has a
lazy eye, it means

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
that the muscles of the lazy
eye are not working well.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is you put
a patch on the good eye

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:90%
for a week.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I
was a baby sitter,

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I had a kid that
I was babysitting.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.125 align:middle line:84%
He was five years old,
and he had a lazy eye.

00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:49.445 align:middle line:84%
For a week, he had a
patch on his good eye.

00:21:49.445 --> 00:21:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And that forces the lazy eye,
the muscles of the lazy eye

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to get stronger and
stronger until, when

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
you took the patch off,
they could both work

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.328 align:middle line:90%
at the same-- in tandem.

00:21:58.328 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
When you're meditating,
it's like putting a patch

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:90%
on your five senses.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you're alive and
you're awake and you're aware,

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.770 align:middle line:84%
but you're not taking in
information from your five

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:90%
senses.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So you start to strengthen
your other sense, which

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.095 align:middle line:90%
is a feeling sense.

00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:84%
You get a feeling for
what's going to happen.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.457 align:middle line:84%
You get a feeling
for where to go.

00:22:15.457 --> 00:22:17.290 align:middle line:84%
You get a feeling for
who you're talking to.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.665 align:middle line:84%
You get a feeling for what
your life's purpose should be.

00:22:19.665 --> 00:22:21.028 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a powerful sense.

00:22:21.028 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like the difference
between seeing and not seeing.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:84%
This is feeling-- feeling
what you're meant to be doing,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.580 align:middle line:84%
feeling where you
should be going.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:84%
I have-- one of our
coaches that we work with,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.970 align:middle line:84%
she went to a movie in
Aurora, Colorado in 2012.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It was the midnight screening
of "Batman Returns."

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:90%
She walks into the theater.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And she says to her friend,
"We got to get out of here.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.870 align:middle line:90%
This is wrong."

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.912 align:middle line:84%
And her friend says, "What
are you talking about?

00:22:45.912 --> 00:22:48.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the midnight
screening of Batman Returns.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
You know how hard it was
to get these tickets?"

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "We are walking
out of this theater right now."

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:90%
She grabbed her by the hand.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:90%
She took her out of the theater.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes later, a man
opened up and fired and shot

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:90%
70 people.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It was the Aurora,
Colorado, shooting.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:90%
She knew.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
How did she know?

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Is that coincidence?

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you possibly chalk
that up to coincidence?

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:90%
You can not.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:84%
It is a sense that
she has developed,

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.050 align:middle line:84%
that we all can develop,
simply by sitting

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and, through meditation,
allowing that sense to mature

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:90%
and to develop.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:90%

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.760 align:middle line:84%
For me, as I'm learning
more and more in my life,

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
the key to happiness
is life force vitality.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.190 align:middle line:84%
So through my meditations
and my visualizations,

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I allow lots of life force
vitality to run through me.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.640 align:middle line:90%
It always-- it keeps me young.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.102 align:middle line:90%
It keeps me vibrant.

00:23:43.102 --> 00:23:44.310 align:middle line:90%
It puts me in the right path.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And part of increasing
life force vitality

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is eating foods that have
more life force vitality.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.572 align:middle line:84%
All energy on this planet
comes from the sun.

00:23:55.572 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
That's where
everything comes from.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So the sun will-- the plants
get energy from the sun.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And they convert that into fats,
carbohydrates, and proteins.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we do all kinds
of crazy things with it,

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and we process it, and we
put pesticides and herbicides

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and toxins, and then
we microwave it,

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and we irradiate
it, and we deep fry

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.380 align:middle line:90%
it and all this type of stuff.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But really, once we do
that, by the time we eat it,

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:84%
our body is trying to break
it down and get that sunlight

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.125 align:middle line:90%
And it's too far away.

00:24:24.125 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
sick all the time.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just all this excess waste
and junk and cellular breakdown

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and hormonal problems because
the food is too far away

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:90%
from life force vitality.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So in the process of
being a peak athlete

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:84%
or living your life's
purpose or just

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:84%
having the body that you
want and being happy,

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.680 align:middle line:84%
you have to add foods that
have life force vitality.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.907 align:middle line:84%
You want to get as close
to sunlight as possible.

00:24:48.907 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's real
simple-- for instance,

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:90%
green leafy vegetables.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.392 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that's
all you have to eat.

00:24:53.392 --> 00:24:55.650 align:middle line:84%
But green leafy vegetables,
sprouts, fermented foods--

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
these foods heal and
nourish and give you

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
the vitality that you need
to live your life's purpose.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.702 align:middle line:90%

00:25:05.702 --> 00:25:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.607 align:middle line:84%
For me, the criteria of a
food is it has to be real--

00:25:10.607 --> 00:25:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that is, that it's
not man-made and we

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.232 align:middle line:90%
haven't tampered with it.

00:25:13.232 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when we make food,
when we process foods,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:84%
the manufacturers
that process foods,

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:84%
they're doing it for
them, not for you.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.920 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it because
it makes it cheaper,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
they don't have to refrigerate
it, it has a longer shelf life,

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:90%
it's addictive.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.803 align:middle line:90%
And that's great for them.

00:25:26.803 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not great for you.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:84%
What's great for you is
food that nourishes you.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is real food,
not man-made food.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we start
tampering with it,

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:90%
it causes all kinds of problems.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the criteria of what
I eat is it has to be real.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.100 align:middle line:84%
If you were living on an
island 10,000 years ago,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:90%
what could you eat?

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
You could-- there's
animal proteins.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:90%
There's salads.

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.460 align:middle line:90%
There's nuts.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:45.910 align:middle line:90%
There's seeds.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:46.710 align:middle line:90%
There's fruits.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:90%
It's all real.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It's all mostly live and as
close to nature as possible.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.658 align:middle line:90%
Everything I eat is real.

00:25:52.658 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a real food diet, and
it works really well for me.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.306 align:middle line:90%

00:25:59.306 --> 00:26:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So the food industry is a
trillion dollar industry.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's face it, there's
billions of people's spending

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:90%
$50, $100 a week on food.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a trillion dollar industry.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And the people that are the
biggest players in the food

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.315 align:middle line:84%
industry, they know how
to make food taste good,

00:26:16.315 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean that
it's necessarily good for you.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
They know how to make
you addicted to the food.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
They know how to pay all
the fancy celebrities

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:90%
so that you think it's cool.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.285 align:middle line:84%
They know how to give you that
instant rush so that you think

00:26:28.285 --> 00:26:30.660 align:middle line:84%
it's something that's supposedly
energy, when really it's

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:90%
just hormonal casts.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.490 align:middle line:84%
They know how to do
all these things.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's really up to us
to take our health back

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:84%
into our own hands, to educate,
and to become aware of the fact

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
that those foods are some
of the worst poisons you

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:90%
can put in your body.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
devious type of poison

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.770 align:middle line:84%
because it's not-- you
don't drop dead instantly.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.340 align:middle line:84%
But you get type 2 diabetes,
you become overweight,

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.902 align:middle line:84%
you get heart problems,
you get cancers.

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you go to the
pharmaceutical industry, which

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.550 align:middle line:90%
are owned by the same people.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.092 align:middle line:84%
And they're giving you all these
pills, which are also toxic.

00:26:59.092 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:90%
And it just cascades.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.330 align:middle line:84%
When, really, what we need
to do is stop buying into it

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and just eat what was put
on this earth as real food,

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:90%
as simple as possible.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:11.633 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:11.633 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I think that anybody can
achieve pretty much anything

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:90%
that they want to.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I think the sky is
the limit, and I think

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:90%
there's a science behind it.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- the more
I'm learning about what

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:84%
my life's purpose is and
what the whole meaning

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of life's purpose is, I'm
starting to understand that we

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.090 align:middle line:90%
all have a purpose--

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.102 align:middle line:90%
every single one of us.

00:27:36.102 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily
a thing like I'm

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
going to be an accountant
or going to be a lawyer.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Every minute it changes,
but we all have a purpose

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and we can tap
into that purpose.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And for me, what I've
learned over the years

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:84%
is the way to tap into that
purpose is really simple.

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:50.960 align:middle line:84%
That purpose is all
around us invisibly.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:90%
We can't see it.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:84%
As I've said before,
we have five senses.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:58.440 align:middle line:84%
It's giving us
0.001% of reality.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But what I have learned
and what quantum physics

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
teaches us also is we are
in an ocean of energy.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's an ocean
of conscious energy

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that you can
channel through you.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.828 align:middle line:84%
And when you channel that energy
through you, it will guide you

00:28:10.828 --> 00:28:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and you will be living
your life's purpose.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And I know this
from trial and error

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:84%
over years and
years and years now.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:84%
That when I get into
a meditative state

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.942 align:middle line:84%
and I open up my energy channels
through a visualization where

00:28:22.942 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm imagining light
going through my body

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm tapping into
this infinite energy,

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I feel it go through me
and I just surrender to it

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:90%
and I ask it to guide me.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I do that, I know
that every minute of that day

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be living
my life's purpose.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.565 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even have to think
about and say I want to be this

00:28:43.565 --> 00:28:44.440 align:middle line:90%
or I want to be that.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.580 align:middle line:90%
I can see it.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.025 align:middle line:84%
I can see that I'm meant to
be going here or doing this

00:28:48.025 --> 00:28:49.150 align:middle line:90%
or communicating with that.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And the whole world
opens up, and it

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:90%
becomes a magical adventure.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
out there trying to--

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:84%
with your head and
your mind trying

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to force things to happen.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.660 align:middle line:84%
You're going in, and you're
tapping into unlimited energy.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And that unlimited energy
will keep you young.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:04.630 align:middle line:90%
It will keep you strong.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:05.588 align:middle line:90%
It will keep you vital.

00:29:05.588 --> 00:29:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And it will keep you
always on your purpose.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when that energy
is moving through you,

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.530 align:middle line:84%
you are always living
your life's purpose.
