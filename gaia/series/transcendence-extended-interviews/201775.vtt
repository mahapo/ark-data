00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.350 align:middle line:84%
It's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.270 align:middle line:10%
And I'm here today with
a dear friend and one

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.810 align:middle line:10%
of my favorite teachers and
experts in her own right

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.400 align:middle line:10%
and also featured on FMTV.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.900 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Kim Morrison.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And she is an expert
in many fields, one

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.390 align:middle line:84%
of them being essential
oils and using plants

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:84%
for healing and
medicine and bringing

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:90%
calm and peace to our lives.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And another one is really
the art of self-love.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's a topic that she's
authored a book on and become

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:90%
quite an expert on.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
about reconnecting

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
with the self,
creating more peace

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and more rituals
in our lives that

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:84%
help us make sense of the
chaos and the absurdity

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:90%
of modern life.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.678 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going to be
talking about all those things

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:90%
and much, much more.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.385 align:middle line:90%
Kimmy Morrison, hey.

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:50.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, gorgeous.

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:52.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm excited to chat again.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.493 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long time
between conversations.

00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But for our viewers, I'd
love if we could just

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.553 align:middle line:84%
rewind a little bit and
begin with the beginning.

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
How did you sort of get
thrust into this world

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
of understanding the
importance of using

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
herbs and essential oils, but
also non-herb and essential oil

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
processes to sort of create
calm and peace in one's life?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I think for me
being a young girl,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:84%
I had a vision and a dream to
play netball for my country.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be an
aspiring athlete.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the top level,
not quite international level.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But it was through that that I
learnt the power of nutrition,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that what I ate really
affected my results.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I took a trip to
Melbourne in Australia.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was while
I was there that I

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:90%
met a man called Cliff Young.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And Cliff Young won
the inaugural Sydney

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to Melbourne race at 68 years
of age-- a potato farmer,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:90%
a man of the land.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And he just had really simple,
beautiful philosophies.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And when I told him
it was boring to watch

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:84%
him run an ultramarathon, he
said, why don't you enter one?

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was during that time
I had been working in a gym.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And next to that was a
Natural Therapies College.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And I had found an interest
and spark in essential oils

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
because I loved the smell
whenever I went to class.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And so then when he invited
me to run this event,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I was in the throes of my
diploma in aromatherapy.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:90%
So I took all my blends with me.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.190 align:middle line:84%
I had never run beyond
10 Ks in my life.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And here I was lined up to
run a 12-hour event armed

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:90%
with essential oils.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways,
I put down winning

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that raised to the power
of how I used the oils when

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I fell into holes and dark
places of not thinking I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.840 align:middle line:90%
could carry on.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was really interesting
how every time I smelt certain

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
smells, I felt more
inspired to get up,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
or I found my tummy
ache disappeared,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
or I could use the
anti-inflammatory oils

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
on my knees and found that
they actually really did work.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I won that and
they gave me my trophy

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
and said I won the race
and had run 95.4 Ks,

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.010 align:middle line:84%
they then gave me
a trophy and said

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:84%
that you'd won a
place to represent

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Victoria in a 24-hour race.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is where I
really came in touch

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:84%
with the power of
plants and medicines

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and using food as a tool
to win another event.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.797 align:middle line:84%
And it was during that
event, James, that I--

00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I did it.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up
setting a world record

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
for being the youngest female
to run 100 miles in less

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:90%
than 24 hours.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And whenever people ask me,
yes, I could say it was mindset.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I could say it
was the power and the drive

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and the determination
and the tenacity,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:84%
which I think coupled with
all of that was powerful.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But every time I used my oils,
every time I used them in a way

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:84%
to lift me or to
support my physicality,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle line:84%
they responded-- or
I responded to them.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was after that race
I decided I definitely

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.810 align:middle line:84%
wanted to pursue a career in
this field of essential oils,

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:90%
because also it helped my team.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.410 align:middle line:84%
When they were feeling
tired, it helped them.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
To inspire me when I
wasn't feeling so great,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:90%
it lifted my spirits.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:90%
It lifted my heart.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:90%
It opened my heart.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I can't even begin to describe
to you how potent they were.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think the more vulnerable
and exhausted you are,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.393 align:middle line:84%
the more you're open to
using anything to support

00:04:10.393 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:90%
you to get through it.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So that was really my intro
into the power and healing

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.454 align:middle line:90%
power of plants.

00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, awesome.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It's funny how this
topic of ultramarathons

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.120 align:middle line:84%
just seems to come up
in so many places now.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've had the opportunity
to interview Dean Karnazes.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:90%
He's an ultramarathon runner--

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.253 align:middle line:90%
Rich Roll as well.

00:04:31.253 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And then even Turia
Pitt's story--

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.240 align:middle line:90%
she was doing an ultramarathon.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.825 align:middle line:84%
So it attracts a strange
and interesting bunch

00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
of people, of which you
are one of them, Kim.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to be
crazy to do it.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you the thing
that I took from it the most,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:84%
is that I use those
ultramarathon stories

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and my experiences as a
direct metaphor for life.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:90%
We hit walls.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:90%
We ache.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:90%
We have tantrums.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:90%
We want to quit.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Life sucks.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Life hurts.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So does running around a
400-meter track for 24 hours.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And the analogies have
become so apparent to me

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that life is one
big ultramarathon.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I think I've
used the experience

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.533 align:middle line:84%
to really identify with my
own experiences in life.

00:05:15.533 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty cool.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a lot of
people don't have much hardship

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:90%
training, right?

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And so when they're exposed to
life, death, pain, destruction,

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
fire, they don't
have much resilience.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.888 align:middle line:90%
You use running in that way.

00:05:32.888 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Is there other ways
you help prepare people

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.615 align:middle line:90%
for the challenges of life?

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's one of
the biggest challenges

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:90%
in today's world.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Resilience is something that
we are not taught, necessarily,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.760 align:middle line:84%
but we learn through experience
or watching resilience.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:10%
So I think perhaps
parents need to have

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:10%
a look at the way
we're cushioning

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:10%
our children,
realizing that it's

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:10%
through the struggles of life
and the challenges in life that

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.480 align:middle line:10%
really opens us up to being
someone greater than we could

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:10%
ever have imagined.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's those little
knocks along the way that

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:84%
create the opportunity
to experience them

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:84%
so that we can handle the
bigger knocks of life.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm yet to meet anyone
that hasn't being challenged

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:90%
or struggled in life.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I am yet to meet
anyone that says

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.305 align:middle line:90%
their life was 100% perfect.

00:06:18.305 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, it's
the people that

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:10%
have been through the biggest
struggles and challenges

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.570 align:middle line:10%
that I've found being
the most interesting

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:10%
because they have almost been
broken open in such a way

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:10%
that the only way out is up.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you
have to just put

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:90%
one foot in front of the other.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And the analogy for me, running
out on a 400-meter track,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.140 align:middle line:84%
was when I wanted to quit so
often because things hurt or I

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.117 align:middle line:84%
didn't think I had anything left
in me, to then just be told,

00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:84%
it's just a case of getting
back out on the track.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.117 align:middle line:84%
It's just one foot in
front of the other, Kim.

00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Just move.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Do not stay stagnant.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
The more stagnant
you are, the more

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
you're open to being
vulnerable to not making it.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
The more stagnant
you are, you're

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:84%
not allowing yourself to
find that inner strength.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's when we
can pick ourselves up and put

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that one foot in front of
the other, stay in action,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
stay in participation of
life, and most importantly,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge that
you're in a tough time.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I think I've seen so many
speakers and read so many books

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and heard so many people say--
and even the head of Lifeline

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:90%
said--

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle line:84%
the first step to getting
out of that challenging time

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:84%
is self-awareness, awareness
that you're actually in it.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you can be aware
that yes, life sucks right now,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
or yes, it hurts
right now, or yes, I'm

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:84%
not in a very good place
right now, in my belief,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
you're already
showing yourself love

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:90%
and forgiving yourself for that.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy of
a running track

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:90%
is the running track of life.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And if Cliffy
taught me anything,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
it was to keep in
motion and never

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
stay stagnant, no matter
what life throws to you.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be easy to
retreat sometimes, can't it?

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think retreating
also has a place.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:84%
There's no point
putting on a happy face

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.940 align:middle line:90%
when you feel really down.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I think honoring the
fact that life sucks

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:90%
and that's not good--

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I think honoring
the fact that you're

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:90%
not a good human right now--

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.510 align:middle line:84%
the amount of apologies I've
made to my children as a mother

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.930 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes I just haven't
been the best version of myself

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.870 align:middle line:84%
has been liberating in that,
that I can apologize to them,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:84%
because with apologies,
we also realize

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that there's potential
for better behavior

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:90%
or betterment of self.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think retreating
sometimes also

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
has a place, that it's important
to pull back to really feel it.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And my beautiful
90-year-old psychologist

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:84%
and the best teacher
I've ever had

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
when I've been going through
the toughest times said to me,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:90%
you have to feel it to heal it.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
real mastery in that,

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:84%
in honoring the
feeling of the pain

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
rather than covering it with
drugs or alcohol or behavior

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that may not serve you
or that you may regret--

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
is really important to
acknowledge that feeling it

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
is actually a fast-track
way to get through it.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Don't hide from it.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Find a way to work
through it and acknowledge

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes it's so bad,
you got nothing but tears.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.500 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and that's deep.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.260 align:middle line:90%
That's profound.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
We're rocketing into some
topics here straightaway.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Typically this is how
our conversations go.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But how do you feel about
the modern landscape

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
of social media and all these
expertly portrayed lives

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
on the web and on social
platforms, sort of impact

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:84%
our sense of self-worth and
what's happening in the world?

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:90%
I think we put--

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
we see so many
lives on display now

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:90%
that are so seemingly perfect.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And we have all these high
expectations for our own lives

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and then all this sort of
disparate nature of comparison

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.112 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that plays
into some of the problems

00:09:58.112 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:90%
that we're suffering from?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it comes
back to self-love.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
You will not look at
someone else's perfect life

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.260 align:middle line:84%
with disdain or
anger or jealousy

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
when you feel great
about yourself.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:84%
The only times you
will find social media

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.850 align:middle line:84%
a negative platform
is when you yourself

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:84%
don't have the resilience
or the happy place

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.590 align:middle line:84%
that you're in to
actually acknowledge it.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.507 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's face it.

00:10:21.507 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Social media is a
highlights reel.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And for most of us, we use
it as a beautiful platform

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:84%
to share the greatest
parts of our lives

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
or the things we've learned
or the recipes we love

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:90%
or the quotes we enjoy.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a two-edged
sword to social media.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.980 align:middle line:84%
There's this
beautiful connectivity

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:84%
that can occur, particularly
for people in remote areas

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:84%
or for people that live
alone or for people

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that may be going through
a process in life,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to have support
groups and chat rooms.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And all of those beautiful
community-derived places

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.110 align:middle line:90%
is essential.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I think the negative comes from
when we haven't delved into who

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
we are and acknowledging
that it's not

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
the fact that their
life is perfect,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:84%
it's the fact that
you've put on a lens that

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:90%
judges that perfection--

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:84%
because let's face it, if
your life was feeling perfect

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and you were in a great
place, you'd be honoring that.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.415 align:middle line:84%
So I actually think it's more
about your own self-reflection

00:11:16.415 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
than what people are
putting on social media.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So what if they put
up the perfect photo?

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So what if they put
up a horrible quote?

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So what if it's something
you don't agree with?

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of social media is
you don't have to interact.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And I find it
fascinating when there's

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.647 align:middle line:84%
trolls or people that find
they're keyboard warriors

00:11:33.647 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:90%
or things like that.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So my way of dealing
with them is appreciating

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.130 align:middle line:84%
that for them to write that or
to say that or to judge that,

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
it's more of a
reflection of them

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:84%
than it is about me or the other
people that they're hassling.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
the actual issue.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not social media.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It's how we respond
to it and the place

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
we're in when we
react negatively.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's easier to
hide behind the facade

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:90%
of the internet, right, as well?

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good point.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.818 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
motherhood a little bit here

00:12:04.818 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
because I know it's something
you're deeply passionate about.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
You're deeply observant
of your own behaviors

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:84%
as a mother in terms of how
that might impact and show

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:90%
to your kids.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've loved hearing
about all your stories

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
as a mother in some
of our interactions

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.570 align:middle line:84%
when you'd come home
and be like, kids,

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.668 align:middle line:90%
I need a bath right now.

00:12:23.668 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
really open with how

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
you manage your emotions
with your children.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's flowed
on to them being,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.382 align:middle line:84%
what I can see, quite
emotionally stable and aware

00:12:32.382 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:84%
of their emotions and
how they can react.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I've got now a
13-year-old in my life.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm an instant
upskilled dad, in a way.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.975 align:middle line:84%
And Hugo as our first
born is six now.

00:12:44.975 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that we've become

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
aware of filming for this
series and doing more interviews

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.470 align:middle line:84%
is that we are so heavily
conditioned as children.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think you've brought
a real conscious awareness

00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:84%
to how you behave around your
children and how you react

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.680 align:middle line:90%
and how you educate them.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:90%
How do you think--

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
what do you think about the
importance of how aware we

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.917 align:middle line:90%
are around our children?

00:13:07.917 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have some stories
about some of the ways

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.170 align:middle line:84%
that you've been able to
manage your relationship

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:84%
in a conscious and observant way
while still allowing them to go

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:90%
through their own struggles.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I think parenting
is one of the greatest,

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
most beautiful personal
development programs you could

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:90%
ever enter.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I think being a
parent highlights

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.500 align:middle line:84%
your own inabilities,
insecurities.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
It highlights what
you're good at.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It also highlights
the incredible gifts

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:84%
that simplicity in a small
child can bring to your world.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And they help you become
more centered in many ways.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
You only have to talk to a child
who's watching a line of ants

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.050 align:middle line:84%
to realize the joy that they get
from watching a line of ants,

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:84%
to realize that sometimes
the simple things in life

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact, sometimes
the most beautiful.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I also know that when we're
pressured and we're working

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're trying to manage our
relationship with our partner

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and trying to also be the
so-called perfect super-mom

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
or -dad, that this
illusion can create stress.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we behave in a
way that isn't necessarily

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:90%
the most enlightening.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And I pretty much
decided early on

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.090 align:middle line:84%
from having children
that my role was

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
to be a great
listener, but my role

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.740 align:middle line:90%
was also to be a great teacher.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And to be a great
teacher, one must also

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
appreciate that you need
to teach from experience.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I've stuffed
up or said the wrong thing

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
or done the wrong thing, I
have found it really important

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge an apology, and
to really own that apology.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we've created, in
our family, apology rituals.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So we have a simple apology
ritual for little things.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
full apology ritual.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.377 align:middle line:84%
And I've also called
my kids into action.

00:14:59.377 --> 00:15:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I've gone
to listen to someone--

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Anthony Robbins,
Demartini, Deepak Chopra--

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:84%
any of the gurus that
we just absolutely love

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and I've embraced
one of their ideals,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.130 align:middle line:84%
it's for the whole family,
not just for me or my husband.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So we've had-- my
beautiful counselor

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and therapist has always
said to me just speak softly.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
That was the beautiful
words that she said.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:84%
She believed one of the
worst things we could do is--

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and she calls it
violence when we yell.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.767 align:middle line:84%
She calls that a
form of violence,

00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
which was quite
confronting, because I

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:90%
found myself yelling sometimes.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.547 align:middle line:84%
And so we put the words speak
softly all around the house,

00:15:37.547 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
right from when they were
little when they couldn't even

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:90%
read the words.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when one
of us was yelling,

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, coming and
get your breakfast!

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:90%
Or, it's on the table!

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
How many times do
I have to call?

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
The children would
walk out pointing

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.600 align:middle line:84%
to the sign, which
often is quite an aha

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
because one time
Jacob said to me,

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
why didn't you come
down and tell us?

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was a part of me
that thought, I'm the adult.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you what
you have to do.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But a part of me was
like, out of respect

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
for another human being,
regardless of age,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.520 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the fact
that I birthed them,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:84%
they actually often can teach
you the greatest lessons.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to know
that make no mistake,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I just recently said
something really, really bad,

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:90%
which I'm happy to share.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But it was like my team
was over from New Zealand

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:90%
with my business.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So I had my colleague
staying with me

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.448 align:middle line:84%
in our little tiny
three-bedroom house.

00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd forgotten it
was school holidays.

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.782 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter was
home from dance school.

00:16:33.782 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
There was seven of
us in this house.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And we were doing
filming all day.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:90%
We were writing programs.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:84%
We were in each other's
pocket for two weeks.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:90%
But on day 11--

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
day 12, actually-- my son
walks into the kitchen.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:90%
And he's grumpy.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell, on the level,
he's actually not happy

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:90%
that he hasn't got my attention.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:90%
So he opens up the pantry door.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, oh, there's
nothing to bloody eat.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
typical teenager, just

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:00.933 align:middle line:90%
says what he thinks.

00:17:00.933 --> 00:17:02.392 align:middle line:84%
And I was a little
bit embarrassed.

00:17:02.392 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:90%
And I've gone, Jacob!

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's just looked
at me and gone, what?

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And then he's
opened the fridge--

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:90%
full of food.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But there was nothing
instant for him to grab.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
And so he's gone, there's
never any food in this house!

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
And I've told him
to pull his head up.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And as he's walked away, Taylor
said just wait a tin of tuna

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:84%
for now while we wait
till we have dinner.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:90%
And he opens the tin of tuna.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
wrong flipping tuna.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:90%
So he slammed it down.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:90%
He's so embarrassed me.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:90%
He stormed up the stairs.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I've told him
to pull his head in.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:84%
He's turned around and
told me to watch myself.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I don't know
where it came from, James.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But I turned around, and I
said oh, go suck yourself!

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And as those words came
out, I was instantly,

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.880 align:middle line:84%
in front of my team,
in front of everybody,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
had gone to what I
call a level one soul,

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:90%
the worst mother in the world.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And he went oh, if they
could all see you now.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:90%
And then I looked at him.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And Taylor yelled out
oh, he would if he could.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was just one
of those moments

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:84%
where we all looked
at each other.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was so humiliated, so
embarrassed that my colleagues

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
saw us in pretty much a
typical family situation.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:90%
But I felt really embarrassed.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Took myself to my room,
and sat in there, sulked,

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:84%
texted Jacob and said he owed
everybody a full apology--

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:22.132 align:middle line:84%
and then half an hour later,
my manager of my business

00:18:22.132 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:84%
came in and said, I
just want you to know

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.450 align:middle line:90%
we've all changed our flights.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:90%
We're going home tomorrow.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Our work is done.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.970 align:middle line:90%
It's enough.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But she said-- and
I said I'm so sorry.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.072 align:middle line:90%
And she said, no.

00:18:32.072 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know
that we're all--

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.905 align:middle line:84%
we've just poured some champagne
down there because we've

00:18:35.905 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:84%
decided that it's so good
to see you being normal.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment,
I guess the lesson

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I took from it is
that we all say things

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.203 align:middle line:90%
maybe even worse than that.

00:18:47.203 --> 00:18:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Another counselor
said to me once,

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
how proud would you feel
if the world's cameras were

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:55.790 align:middle line:84%
in your house 24/7 and you were
portrayed out to the world?

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:84%
How manageable would you be of
your emotions if you knew that?

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And most people have said
to me that they would be

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:90%
more mindful of how they spoke.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, my question is
why is it, then, you

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
think it's OK to
speak to the people

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
you love the most in a
way that you wouldn't

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.780 align:middle line:90%
want the world to see you?

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it time we stepped up?

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it time we became more
impeccable with our word?

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it time we became more
responsible and accountable

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
for our actions and
the way we do speak?

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you by
doing that and apologizing

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:84%
to my son for what I
said, he also then turned

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:84%
around and arrived and
walked back into the house

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and said a full
apology to everybody

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:90%
in the home for his behavior.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:84%
So again, giving
him time to retreat,

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:84%
giving him time to acknowledge,
realizing that he was hungry--

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:90%
hangry--

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.430 align:middle line:84%
understanding that
we all make mistakes,

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I made a fool of myself as
well, and all of us owning it,

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone in
the home actually

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:84%
went to a deeper
level of connection,

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.340 align:middle line:84%
of love, of understanding,
of compassion.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So my learnings in all of
this is the more vulnerable,

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.160 align:middle line:84%
the more open, the
more raw we are,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean to say it gives you
permission to be in a dick head

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:90%
or to be awful.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
But it does give ourselves
permission to be ourselves.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we are level one
souls and not very enlightened

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
That is part of the
human experience.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>> We've all been there.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, wow.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
That's an interesting and
fun exchange for you to have.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's been
there, for sure.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that you touched on

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
was around being
impeccable with your word.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I love Don Miguel
Ruiz, as his work--

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:90%
I love his book.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I found it incredibly
impactful for me.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
I've really taken along

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle line:90%
in my journey of life.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
it is, or how do

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:84%
you think it is, that people
can develop such negative voices

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
in their mind or in their
head of the language they

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:90%
use for themselves?

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.857 align:middle line:84%
Because you talk about when
you said, that the language

00:20:57.857 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:84%
you use to others-- but also we
use that language to ourselves

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:90%
each morning.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
We wake up in the
mirror and so forth.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.673 align:middle line:90%
Well look at you, you fatso.

00:21:04.673 --> 00:21:05.840 align:middle line:90%
How'd you get off your butt?

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so much subtle
language we use to ourselves.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
that's happened?

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's part of
the human experience.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I went to
India a number of years ago,

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I was so fortunate to sit-in
the presence of His Holiness,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
the 12th Kenting Tai Situpa,
who is the main educator

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:90%
of all Buddhist monks.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And we had a seven-day
retreat with him

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:84%
where we sat at his feet
and listened to his lessons

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:84%
on human and how
to heal our life.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things,
when I got the privilege

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:middle line:84%
of having a one-on-one
with him, is he said,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:90%
what have you got to ask me?

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.227 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, I've
got a question for you.

00:21:44.227 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why
does the human being

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.900 align:middle line:90%
have to experience struggle?

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Why do we say awful things?

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do awful things?

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:10%
Why do we have to endure
struggle and challenge

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:10%
and change and adversity?

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
he kind of chuckled.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, my dear, how
could you possibly understand

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:90%
light without dark?

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:84%
How could you possibly
understand high without low?

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
How could you possibly
understand love without fear?

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And the takeaway I took is the
dichotomy of the human spirit,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:84%
the human being, is we
must endure and face

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:84%
adversity and challenge
and negative thinking.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:90%
It is part of being human.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is what drives
our quest for enlightenment

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:84%
or our quest for spirituality
or our quest for true love.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's a gift.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.728 align:middle line:84%
I believe sure, in
the throes of it,

00:22:46.728 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to turn
around to somebody lying

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:84%
in the fetal position
and say oh, this

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:90%
is a beautiful gift right now.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.955 align:middle line:84%
In the throes of challenge,
you have to feel it to heal it.

00:22:56.955 --> 00:22:57.830 align:middle line:90%
You have to honor it.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:90%
You have to endure it.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:84%
You have to find help as you
masterly find a way through it.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But you do have
to get through it,

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.640 align:middle line:84%
or you become a victim
of circumstance.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes
a layer and a shield

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to stop love coming
in because now you're

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:90%
putting up protection barriers.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Or my father never
said he loved me.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, I don't like all men.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Or I got dumped when I was 22,
and therefore I don't trust.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Or my mother died
when I was young.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I never
want to be a mother.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
You can use your
circumstance as a weapon.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can use it
as an excuse for not

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:84%
being the true reflection
and absolute beauty of who

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:90%
you are as a human.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Or you can say, wow.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:90%
That happened to me.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do with it?

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:84%
How do I use it to
become a better person?

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:84%
How can I teach
another human how

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:84%
to get through the
same experience

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.840 align:middle line:84%
now that I've had
to experience it?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.490 align:middle line:84%
How do I connect with
other humans that

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:84%
have gone through this to
show compassion and empathy

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:90%
and loyalty and understanding?

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I stand here
as somebody who has

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:90%
been through many challenges.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:84%
But I look at my
challenges sometimes,

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.408 align:middle line:84%
and I realize when I listen
to other people's, if I

00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:84%
said to everybody with
all your challenges,

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
let's put them all in
the middle of the room,

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
everybody put your
challenges in,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.007 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you most of us
would take our own ones back.

00:24:19.007 --> 00:24:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Most of us look at other
people's challenges

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and realize that
ours really may be

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.610 align:middle line:84%
quite inconsequential, really,
in the scheme of things.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:90%
But make no mistake.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:90%
We're here to learn.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:84%
We are here to find our way
spiritually through this world.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't find a
spiritual answer through this,

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:84%
then maybe your
job on this planet

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.020 align:middle line:84%
this time around was to learn
at just at a level one soul.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not judging where we're
at or what we're about.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm just curious around how we
each deal with those things.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people say, that
have lost their husbands

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
in car accidents
tragically young,

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I am so honored to have
been married for 12 years

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to that man, rather than
I'm so gutted I lost him.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.270 align:middle line:84%
My own mother-in-law
says daily, who

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:84%
lost her daughter to suicide,
I had 36 amazing years with one

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful women I've
ever had the privilege to know,

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:90%
let alone birth.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I've had gentlemen who have
been married for 50 years say,

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I had 50 years of the most
extraordinary companionship.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't hear the people that
seem to appreciate and embrace

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:84%
struggle talk
about the struggle.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They embrace the beauty and
what they had from that.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is
something I personally

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.370 align:middle line:90%
would love to master.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on a quest to
really learn and experience

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:90%
what I can be.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:10%
So my mistakes, my challenges,
my pitfalls, or every time

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.520 align:middle line:10%
I have something occur that
I'd really rather not, are

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.100 align:middle line:10%
an opportunity with
awareness to learn

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.820 align:middle line:10%
how to grow through that with
courage and grace and strength

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:10%
and dignity, and to come out the
other side a more humble, less

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.100 align:middle line:10%
ego-driven human.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
To allow my experience to
support you through it,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:90%
that would be my wish.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so great.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:10%
I find it interesting musing on
this idea, because from trauma

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:10%
to realization that
maybe it served you

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.910 align:middle line:10%
in a deep and more
meaningful way

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:10%
that you didn't
understand at the time,

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.810 align:middle line:10%
there is a gap, right?

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes that gap's very short.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that's true for
very evolved spiritual people.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Like the Dalai Lama, when
asked about how the Chinese are

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.980 align:middle line:84%
basically taking over parts
of his country and slaying

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:84%
millions of his people, he
sort of doesn't laugh it off.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:84%
But he's like, they're
my biggest teachers.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, how do
you already realize that?

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a life
of spiritual work.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And for somebody to realize--
maybe take 20 or 30 years

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to realize that that car
accident was the biggest gift

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.890 align:middle line:90%
for them--

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:90%
is someone that needs more work.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.042 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you sort
of manage that process?

00:26:59.042 --> 00:27:01.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you guide people
through making a realization?

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Is it asking better-quality
questions of a circumstance?

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Is that something, or
a language that helps

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:90%
people to make sense of trauma?

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I think this is where when my
16-year-old son at the time sat

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.992 align:middle line:84%
on the end of my bed
and he was broken,

00:27:15.992 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'd been trying
to talk to him,

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'd been trying to show him
and support him and coach him

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and mentor him through it.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.920 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is his
pain, his experience,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
his perception of what he
was going through was his.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't change it.

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:31.610 align:middle line:10%
So this particular day--

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:10%
and he was actually the main
reason why I went on a quest

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:10%
to understand and unravel how
do people get from here to here,

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.790 align:middle line:10%
going through pain?

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:10%
And I had been asking
and researching

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.330 align:middle line:10%
for three years, what do
people do to still believe

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:10%
in the power of love when
they've been so challenged?

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And for me, maybe being an
athlete, I needed a pathway.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I needed steps.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But I came up with
a six-step pathway

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.660 align:middle line:84%
which I shared with Jacob
on the end of my bed.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And Taylor had
appeared in the room.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:90%
And Danny was lying with me.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:84%
But we went silent
during this process.

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And I just drew
what I had learned.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And so in the
middle of this page,

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I drew a big heart
saying self-love.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said to everyone
sitting there on my bed,

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:84%
if we know that self-love
is the key to a truly

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.383 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, open-hearted
experience of life,

00:28:21.383 --> 00:28:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and we know that self-love
is what will get us

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:84%
through anything
and everything, then

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand there's
an opposing force here which

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.945 align:middle line:84%
we mask as self-sabotage, but in
fact, it could be titled fear.

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So when I talked to
them, I said, well,

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
what are some self-sabotaging
behaviors we do?

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, fear, not good
enough, loathing, hate,

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:84%
judgment, not being accountable,
blame, denial, making excuses.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.880 align:middle line:84%
That's all what I would call
self-sabotaging behavior.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't serve us, maybe.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:90%
But it seemed to not serve us.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, if it's part
of the human existence,

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
and no one never
doesn't not do that,

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.990 align:middle line:84%
then maybe it is
part of what it is.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So acknowledging--
the first step,

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe, back to
self-love, is self-awareness,

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:90%
which I've already alluded to.

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But self-awareness to
me is understanding

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:84%
that I'm in a bad place,
understanding I'm talking badly

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:84%
to myself, understanding I'm
going through massive grief

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
right now, understanding I've
lost my job, understanding

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm angry with life right now.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.560 align:middle line:84%
When I'm aware I'm all of those
things or some of those things,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm already back in the
pathway of self-love.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The next most critical step
in my belief is self-care.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:84%
You see, most of
the time when we're

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.440 align:middle line:84%
in a place of fear
or self-sabotage,

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.690 align:middle line:90%
we don't look after ourselves.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:84%
That's when we take drugs or
hallucinogenics or we eat badly

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.470 align:middle line:84%
or we don't exercise or
we shame on other people

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.430 align:middle line:90%
or we judge more.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore
to me, self-care

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:84%
is the fast track,
fast pathway back.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:50.900 align:middle line:90%
So

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Things like just walking
outside and putting both feet

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.310 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth and looking up
and taking three deep breaths,

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:84%
eating greens with every
meal, running your beach

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
if you happen to be lucky
enough to live near a beach,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.500 align:middle line:84%
or hug a tree-- as silly
as that sounds, the energy

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and the vibrational frequency
we can attain from that is

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.060 align:middle line:90%
beyond articulation, actually.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Making sure that
you move your body,

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just a
stretch when you stand up--

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:84%
putting essential oils in
a bath or in a diffuser

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful way to
bring nature indoors.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Writing a love note to
yourself or to the person

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that's hurt you or to the
thing that's upset you--

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:84%
these are all self-care
rituals, I believe,

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that actually put you
into a place of gratitude.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know through the work
of someone like Dr. Libby,

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:84%
we know that deep breaths
and gratitude stimulates

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the parasympathetic
nervous system, which

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:90%
then allows us to be more calm.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.430 align:middle line:90%
So imagine that.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Just taking better care of
yourself is actually self-love.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And it opposes the
force that took you out

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:90%
of love in the first place.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:90%
But here's the next ones.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.470 align:middle line:84%
The next step is
self-discipline.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And unless you're willing to
put the work in and do the work,

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:84%
then this can all
fall on deaf ears.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.795 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline to
attain anything in life.

00:31:05.795 --> 00:31:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline
to save money.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline
to be healthy.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.840 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline to
be unhealthy, actually.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.245 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline to be
mindful of how you speak.

00:31:14.245 --> 00:31:15.620 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline
not to swear.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline to
take care of yourself.

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.820 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline
to get a degree.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So discipline is, in
fact, another human trait

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think
we tap into enough.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:90%
We all have discipline.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.707 align:middle line:84%
And if you're someone who sits
in self-pity all the time,

00:31:29.707 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
well, it's taken a lot of
discipline to get there.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So flip it and use the
discipline to, now,

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.640 align:middle line:84%
work your way through it,
through steps of self-care,

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.970 align:middle line:84%
listening to beautiful books,
reading , getting help,

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.300 align:middle line:84%
seeking support of people
who actually understand you

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and don't buy into the
big pity party of you.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Discipline, to me, is one of
the most important aspects

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:90%
of self-love.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It takes work to
truly love yourself.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.967 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people like
Adele say she didn't

00:31:55.967 --> 00:31:57.050 align:middle line:90%
think she was good enough.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.175 align:middle line:84%
I've heard people like
Serena Williams interviewed,

00:31:59.175 --> 00:32:01.940 align:middle line:84%
saying she's questioned if
she'd ever be good enough.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I've heard some of the
most extraordinary people

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:90%
question their worth.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:90%
I've done it many, many times.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's not unhuman to do that.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:10%
It's what we do with
those thoughts that

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:10%
will have us come out a
bigger, better person for it.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So in my belief, the first
three steps-- awareness,

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:84%
self-care, and
self-discipline, are the doing.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.350 align:middle line:90%
You got to do the work.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.530 align:middle line:84%
But I can promise you
if you stick to it

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and you keep, with
volition, doing

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.240 align:middle line:84%
that, then you will have better
self-control, the next step.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.080 align:middle line:84%
You will be more accountable
to your words and behaviors.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.970 align:middle line:84%
You will be more mindful
about what you eat.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.910 align:middle line:84%
When you have had discipline
about eating well,

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to sabotage
your body by face-planting

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.180 align:middle line:90%
a chocolate cake the next day.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.357 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
really mindful of that.

00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:84%
You're also going
to have more control

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:50.030 align:middle line:84%
about the way you treat others,
the planet, the environment.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Discipline is a beautiful
step to understanding

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.370 align:middle line:90%
how controlled we can be.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And with self-control
comes a much higher level

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:90%
of self-respect.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And that next step is
something that I have

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.390 align:middle line:90%
studied in different cultures.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's through
culture and tradition

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:84%
that you'll really understand
the word self-respect.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's turning to
my own home country,

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.460 align:middle line:84%
the Maori culture is something
I really revere and admire

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and even wished I could have
been a part of, because I

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:20.840 align:middle line:90%
love it so much.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
You only have to watch the
Maori haka to understand

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.770 align:middle line:84%
the essence of power
and strength and courage

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.950 align:middle line:84%
that comes through a community
of people who believe in one

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.660 align:middle line:90%
another and their people.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.290 align:middle line:10%
But there's a word in the New
Zealand Maori language which is

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:42.000 align:middle line:10%
mana, M-A-N-A. And it
means godly-like qualities.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And it means seeing
the god in you and me.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.570 align:middle line:10%
And when you really
understand that,

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.700 align:middle line:10%
that is understanding
self-respect,

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.160 align:middle line:10%
understanding you
are of godly nature,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:10%
you are of godly content,
you deserve to be here.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.990 align:middle line:84%
When you have that, you're
not going to allow someone

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.490 align:middle line:90%
to treat you badly.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:84%
You'll have a higher
sense of self-- not ego,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just a more prouder
or more loving sense of self.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:84%
With self-respect
means that you will not

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.040 align:middle line:84%
put things into or onto your
body that do not serve you.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:21.485 align:middle line:84%
You will not embrace negativity
as easily as you would

00:34:21.485 --> 00:34:22.610 align:middle line:90%
when you hold self-respect.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:90%
You won't gossip.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:84%
My daughter nailed
it beautifully

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.442 align:middle line:84%
when I said to her what's your
definition of self-respect?

00:34:28.442 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:84%
She said, mom, it's
when you get up

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.449 align:middle line:84%
and you get into the day willing
to ask yourself what you're

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:35.300 align:middle line:90%
going to contribute to the day.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It's getting up and taking care
of the planet, the environment.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.030 align:middle line:84%
It's dressing with
honor and pride.

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:84%
She said, it's
also not gossiping

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.699 align:middle line:90%
or putting other people down.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not about knocking
others or having judgment,

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.820 align:middle line:84%
but truly valuing
your own self-worth.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I looked at her at 17 and
thought she nailed it.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So self-respect is a very big
piece of the self-love circle.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I believe when
you practice self-respect,

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.420 align:middle line:84%
then you have the sixth and
final step, in my opinion,

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:90%
and that is self-acceptance.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And self-acceptance is
when you can appreciate

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.570 align:middle line:90%
who you are, warts and all.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.240 align:middle line:84%
You love the fact
that you make mistakes

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.740 align:middle line:84%
because it's through mistakes
you're actually showing others

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.690 align:middle line:90%
how to be when you correct it.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was going
through a particularly

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:84%
challenging time in my marriage
and we were really struggling.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.240 align:middle line:90%
And things had happened.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And my husband had been through
major depression and anxiety.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And we'd lost his
sister to suicide.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.390 align:middle line:90%
He'd been drinking.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:31.850 align:middle line:84%
He'd been partying in
ways I had no concept of.

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And he openly allows me
to share this in the hope

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.090 align:middle line:84%
that others will see
the truth in this.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there
with our counselor.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.227 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, how do
I be with our children?

00:35:42.227 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And she said in her French
accent, (FRENCH ACCENT)

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
oh my darling, it's not your
job to give your children

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.360 align:middle line:90%
a perspective on this.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It's your job to
show your children

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.170 align:middle line:90%
how to get through tough times.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't to hide from
the truth of challenge,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.670 align:middle line:84%
it was to show them that we each
had enough respect in ourselves

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:84%
and each other and our
family to show them we

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.480 align:middle line:84%
were working on
this, to show them

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that we would give it everything
we could to get through this.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And beautiful
Jacqueline said to me,

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.930 align:middle line:84%
when you're going
through a challenge,

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:middle line:90%
always give it four seasons.

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.190 align:middle line:84%
As humans we make
decisions so quickly.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the big
decisions in life

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.050 align:middle line:84%
would actually be really
nice to give it four seasons

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.640 align:middle line:90%
before you decide on something.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her why
she said four seasons.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And she said, (FRENCH ACCENT)
oh my darling, some of us

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:90%
are better in spring.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.547 align:middle line:84%
Some of us have better
energy in winter.

00:36:32.547 --> 00:36:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Some are better in autumn.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And some are better,
obviously, in summer.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.730 align:middle line:84%
She said, so why not
allow the full context

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.600 align:middle line:84%
of your human experience
in that whole four seasons?

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And really allow it to
sit with you before making

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.680 align:middle line:90%
that big decision?

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.290 align:middle line:10%
And I've had friends who have
taken that on before they've

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:51.480 align:middle line:10%
decided to ask
someone to marry them,

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.460 align:middle line:10%
or decided to have children.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.670 align:middle line:10%
And it really does give
you that space and ability

00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:01.950 align:middle line:10%
to retreat into self to, then,
find those questions answered

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:06.220 align:middle line:10%
by yourself and really
live by those truths.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think when I look
at those six steps--

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:84%
self-awareness, self-care,
self-discipline, self-control,

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
self-respect, and
self-acceptance--

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.740 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
where we fall out

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.450 align:middle line:84%
or if we get knocked
by a Mack Truck

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:84%
with some bad news or our
relationship falls over

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:25.830 align:middle line:84%
or we get confronted with
life changing situations.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Then there's always a way back.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And to me, a pathway
is always the key

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.240 align:middle line:84%
to help me put one foot
back in front of the other

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and get back out onto
the track of life.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.257 align:middle line:90%
>> You got lucky kids, Kim.

00:37:39.257 --> 00:37:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They're lucky to have those
messages in your life.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, wow.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I can tell you at
the end of that conversation,

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.285 align:middle line:90%
Jacob looked up at me.

00:37:46.285 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:90%
All four of us were silent.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And he just said,
mom, I've never

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.815 align:middle line:84%
had it explained to
me like that before.

00:37:51.815 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:90%
You've got to write a book.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got to tell
other people about it.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what inspired
me, that moment,

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.920 align:middle line:84%
my son at breakpoint where he
did not want to exist anymore,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:84%
to turn around within 15
minutes and say to me,

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I have to share this
with someone else.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how I believe
our children are our greatest

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:10.914 align:middle line:90%
teachers?

00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course I can.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:15.165 align:middle line:90%
>> I nearly got emotional there.

00:38:15.165 --> 00:38:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wow.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Well I mean, it's a real
interesting circle of life

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.930 align:middle line:84%
isn't it, because I think
my whole line of work

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.940 align:middle line:84%
over the last 12 or
15 years was really

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:90%
an impetus to help my dad.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And then for me to
realize that wow,

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:84%
we're helping each other in so
many ways, we're like a team.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.030 align:middle line:90%
He's needed me.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.370 align:middle line:90%
I've needed him.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I've had people say, why me?

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.493 align:middle line:84%
Why do I have to
go through this?

00:38:42.493 --> 00:38:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Your dad could say
the same thing.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:48.170 align:middle line:90%
So many people can say, why me?

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:90%
I say, why not you?

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.662 align:middle line:90%
What have you got for me?

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.120 align:middle line:10%
What have you got
for the universe?

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.820 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to show up
so that you can teach others

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:58.860 align:middle line:84%
how they can do this with
courage and grace and strength

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.660 align:middle line:90%
and dignity?

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.024 align:middle line:10%
Why not you?

00:39:02.024 --> 00:39:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:09.410 align:middle line:84%
You talk about four
agreements in your book.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain that a
little bit more for me?

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:14.605 align:middle line:84%
>> It had such a profound
impact on me, that book.

00:39:14.605 --> 00:39:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The four agreements--
number one,

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:90%
be impeccable with your word.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Number two-- ask questions.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.370 align:middle line:90%
Don't make assumptions.

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Number three-- don't
take things personally.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And number four--
always give your best.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:90%
I believe in Don's work.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:84%
If we could all live by
those four agreements,

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we'd
be needing to talk

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.900 align:middle line:84%
about why self-love is such
a difficult concept for so

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.070 align:middle line:90%
many people.

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And I agree that if we could
even just take the don't take

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:84%
things personally, if we could
just take that one on, it would

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:51.650 align:middle line:84%
be a game changer in the way
you believe in yourself. .

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's a-- my
husband played cricket

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.030 align:middle line:90%
for New Zealand for 10 years.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
if I can say this.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But his line was, "Opinions
are like assholes.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's got one."

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And I used to think,
oh, that was so harsh.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:06.260 align:middle line:90%
But I would read the paper.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And he'd go, don't
worry about it.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And I love what
Ricky Gervais says.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:84%
"These people don't come
home and have dinner with me.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it."

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.208 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
important that people

00:40:15.208 --> 00:40:16.625 align:middle line:84%
are-- there are
going to be people

00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:17.870 align:middle line:90%
that want to have opinions.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
give you attacks, maybe.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Or they're going to say
things that aren't nice.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps they're going to
say things that really hurt.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But to turn it around-- and
one of the key things that I

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:84%
took from that is if
someone says you're useless

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:84%
or you're hopeless and
they're saying that

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.420 align:middle line:84%
or I'm hearing those words,
one of the tools that I took on

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:41.360 align:middle line:84%
was actually just
replace you with I.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually saying
I'm useless or I'm hopeless.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's been a really
good game changer for me

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.180 align:middle line:90%
because it's true.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say those things
unless I had been that

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.450 align:middle line:84%
or unless I believe that or
I was behaving like that.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really important
to know that people will

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.830 align:middle line:84%
say things, and it's
more a reflection

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.950 align:middle line:84%
on what they're thinking and
feeling than it is about you.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:07.640 align:middle line:84%
If you could learn to create
a beautiful rebounding

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.770 align:middle line:84%
shield that just turned
it back into whenever

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:84%
they say you, say
I, that's become

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:14.840 align:middle line:90%
my own protective shield.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And if there's still a charge
associated to taking something

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.520 align:middle line:84%
personally, then go after the
why I'm feeling the charge,

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.960 align:middle line:90%
not what they said.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the real work.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Why am I still having a
charge around that comment?

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:31.100 align:middle line:10%
What can I do about it
to work on it for myself?

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a beautiful
statement-- my business,

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.390 align:middle line:84%
your business, and
universal business.

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.450 align:middle line:10%
My business is how I
behave in life, what I say,

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:42.320 align:middle line:10%
my actions, my judgments, my
perceptions, my behaviors.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.880 align:middle line:10%
They're all my business.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:10%
Your business is how you behave,
act, your opinions, and all

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:48.560 align:middle line:10%
the things that you do.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And then there's universal
business, flowers growing,

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.790 align:middle line:84%
the wind blowing, planes
falling out of the sky,

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.870 align:middle line:90%
volcanoes erupting.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:90%
There's universal business.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It's none of my business
what you think of me.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.200 align:middle line:10%
And that's also been a
really beautiful tool for me,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.930 align:middle line:10%
particularly the
more out there I

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.200 align:middle line:10%
am with speaking and
teaching and sharing

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.587 align:middle line:10%
myself so openly and so
vulnerably, that sometimes--

00:42:16.587 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:10%
you know, I got given
a quote one day.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You can be the juiciest,
ripest, most succulent peach

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:84%
on the tree, and some people
just don't like peaches.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is a beautiful
way of looking at life.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to get
on with everybody.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to be
everyone's friends.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that
beautiful quote--

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.070 align:middle line:84%
a reason, a season,
and a lifetime--

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.610 align:middle line:84%
could not be more profound than
in doing this work of being

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:41.662 align:middle line:90%
a human being.

00:42:41.662 --> 00:42:43.370 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
come into our lives

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:46.010 align:middle line:84%
for a reason, some for a
season, and then there's

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:49.280 align:middle line:84%
some beautiful souls who
stay with us for a lifetime.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we can
appreciate that life

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is full of joys and challenges,
friends that will be here

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:84%
forever, and some
that won't be there

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.480 align:middle line:84%
for very long, that there's
happiness and there's sadness.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.480 align:middle line:10%
There's times when we
feel great about ourselves

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.980 align:middle line:10%
and there's times where we don't
feel great about ourselves.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.460 align:middle line:84%
If we could just come to a
beautiful place of acceptance

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:10.940 align:middle line:84%
in realizing that life is
a constant ultramarathon

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's times where
we're going to be chafed,

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.952 align:middle line:84%
hurt, sore, and blisters,
and then there's

00:43:15.952 --> 00:43:17.660 align:middle line:84%
times when we've pulled
muscles, and then

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:21.170 align:middle line:84%
there's times when literally it
is important to quit the race

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:90%
and start a new one--

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.250 align:middle line:84%
if we can just understand
it's all a beautiful tapestry

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.202 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to
be a human being,

00:43:27.202 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
then maybe we'd give
ourselves permission

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to be a little kinder,
not only to ourselves,

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.720 align:middle line:84%
but to each other, and
not only to each other,

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.910 align:middle line:90%
but to the planet.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:36.710 align:middle line:84%
After all, the
vibrational frequency

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that we all share with one
another is in fact all one.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And if we can only tap into
that and realize that I'm only

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.050 align:middle line:84%
as powerful as you're
as powerful as me,

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:51.320 align:middle line:84%
then a beautiful dance can
occur between other human beings

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to be
truly in love with oneself.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.900 align:middle line:10%
I think that's the key.

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wow.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Far out, yeah, so good.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.552 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:44:04.552 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to break it
down practically a bit

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.970 align:middle line:90%
as we get towards the end here.

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You're a master at
self-care rituals,

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean in incorporating
essential oils,

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:18.710 align:middle line:84%
in affirmations, in just the
way that you approach life.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just exciting
to take a lot of the tips

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.560 align:middle line:84%
that you've shared with
people and with me-- putting

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.180 align:middle line:84%
essential oils on
my pillow at night,

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.970 align:middle line:84%
or just when you're
rubbing cream on,

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.110 align:middle line:90%
rub up and around you?

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.070 align:middle line:90%
All these things--

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to do that.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.675 align:middle line:90%
I don't have breasts.

00:44:32.675 --> 00:44:34.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's still,
I think, so much

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.990 align:middle line:84%
great gold in the real practical
applications of your message

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:40.460 align:middle line:90%
about self-love.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk to me
about some of the ways

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.915 align:middle line:84%
that you advise people
just getting a start?

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:46.040 align:middle line:90%
Say they're on ground zero.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.288 align:middle line:84%
They've gone through
a traumatic event

00:44:48.288 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:84%
or they're just looking
to make some improvements

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.500 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I love how practical
your work is.

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:55.822 align:middle line:84%
Can you share some of
what it might be like

00:44:55.822 --> 00:44:58.280 align:middle line:84%
that you would share with people
normally about what to do?

00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're in
the depths of despair

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.270 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to pick yourself up.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But in all reality, to get
on and through with life,

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.090 align:middle line:84%
you got to do
something, which is

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.460 align:middle line:84%
why I found essential
oils so helpful,

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.350 align:middle line:84%
because they're like
my little buddy.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:15.080 align:middle line:84%
They're like my little tool, my
little tip, my little strategy

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:90%
that makes me do something.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So putting a diffuser on
or lighting a vaporizer

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and putting your few
drops of essential oil

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.980 align:middle line:84%
into the top of that and
allowing the first few breaths

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.380 align:middle line:84%
for you to take a moment
to acknowledge that

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:31.430 align:middle line:84%
is an art of self-care, a
gift of self-care to yourself.

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:32.975 align:middle line:90%
It could be in the body.

00:45:32.975 --> 00:45:34.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have a shower.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Whether I'm down in the
dumps or not, at some point

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:36.875 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take a shower.

00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So putting two drops of,
say, lavender on my flannel

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.030 align:middle line:84%
when I'm in the shower and body
boosting my whole body with it,

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.060 align:middle line:90%
is a little thing.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.720 align:middle line:84%
It's still having a shower,
but I'm doing something

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.490 align:middle line:90%
a little treat to myself.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I do a ritual that I've
done every single day

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:52.910 align:middle line:90%
since I was 19.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:55.910 align:middle line:84%
After my shower, I take
a teaspoon of carrier oil

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and three drops of my
chosen essential oils,

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:90%
a few sprays of magnesium--

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I mix it together
in a little bowl.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And from toe to head,
I massage myself

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and give thanks to
every part of my body.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And usually at the end of
that, I will say something

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:14.150 align:middle line:84%
like today is going to be a
great day, or I'm a good mom,

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:16.610 align:middle line:84%
or I'm an amazing
businesswoman, or I

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:19.520 align:middle line:90%
can write this article today.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's great
on the good days.

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe in being
authentic and integral

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.630 align:middle line:90%
in the days that aren't so good.

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you do that ritual on
a day where you're not feeling

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.225 align:middle line:84%
so great, then when
you get to the part

00:46:30.225 --> 00:46:32.600 align:middle line:84%
where you take three deep
breaths and say something nice,

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.930 align:middle line:84%
then that is the day I
will say I'm just grateful

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:37.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm breathing.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.290 align:middle line:90%
The sun is shining.

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:40.610 align:middle line:90%
I've got this.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Or it might be asking
god, source, universe,

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:48.530 align:middle line:84%
give me the courage,
grace, strength, dignity,

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:51.408 align:middle line:84%
and amazing ability
to get through this.

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's about
being authentic when you're

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:90%
going through tough times.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Putting a half a
lemon into your water

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.770 align:middle line:84%
may seem like such
a simple ritual,

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:03.020 align:middle line:84%
but it is such a
cleansing thing to do.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.750 align:middle line:84%
The metaphor of taking
water to cleanse,

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and lemon to help cleanse
your digestive system, also

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:84%
helps cleanse negative
thoughts and thinking.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Walking outside with a drop
of frankincense on a tissue

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and taking three deep breaths
in bare feet touching the Earth

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:20.720 align:middle line:84%
is a great way to
connect us to source,

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.730 align:middle line:84%
or at least reach out and ask
for some guidance and support.

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe in going
out walking in nature,

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.600 align:middle line:84%
even if it's out on
a walk on concrete.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes for me when I
go out running or jogging,

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.330 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it hurts.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And instead of giving up and
going oh, I can't do this,

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I've got a mantra that I say
every time any part of me

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:46.395 align:middle line:84%
hurts, my heart included,
when I'm out walking in nature

00:47:46.395 --> 00:47:47.270 align:middle line:90%
or running in nature.

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is, every
step I take, I

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.890 align:middle line:84%
am connected to
you, Mother Earth.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.690 align:middle line:10%
Every breath I take, I'm aware
of my thoughts, feelings,

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.000 align:middle line:10%
and emotions.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And I am proud, privileged,
and honored to be out here

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.850 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of all
of those who can't.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds me that there's
people that would give anything

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to be out here
walking in nature,

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.660 align:middle line:84%
or there's people out there
that would love two healthy legs

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.480 align:middle line:84%
to walk, or there's people
who are so broken-hearted they

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.560 align:middle line:90%
can't even breathe right now.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So part of my giving
back to humanity

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.110 align:middle line:84%
is honoring all
those people in pain

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.690 align:middle line:84%
through my own daily
self-care rituals.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:24.320 align:middle line:84%
It can be something as
simple as a spritzer,

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.940 align:middle line:84%
filling a little
bottle with water

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and adding six drops of
essential oil to that.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And I have them in the car.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:30.880 align:middle line:90%
I have them in my handbag.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.852 align:middle line:84%
I have them in the fridge
on hot, sunny days.

00:48:32.852 --> 00:48:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I had them beside the
bed when I say good night

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to my children who are still--

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.510 align:middle line:90%
they're now adult children.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.850 align:middle line:84%
I still aromatically
spritz and kiss

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:40.990 align:middle line:90%
them goodnight every night.

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:43.870 align:middle line:84%
They'll get a little spritz
with some calming oils.

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I call them
aromatic anchors, ways in which

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.440 align:middle line:84%
to anchor yourself to
the truth, to the core,

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.350 align:middle line:84%
to the rawness of
where I'm at right now,

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:84%
by giving me something to do
so that I can get through it.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I think all of these
little rituals and anything

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to do with nature, food,
breath, meditation--

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:03.850 align:middle line:90%
oh my gosh.

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You see, when you're feeling
down and out sometimes sitting

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:11.020 align:middle line:84%
there meditating is the last
thing you've got the courage

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:84%
to do because the
monkey brain kicks in

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:15.520 align:middle line:84%
or we don't feel good
about it or whatever.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, after reading
Thich Nhat Hanh's book,

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:21.010 align:middle line:84%
this Tibetan Buddhist monk,
he talks about being mindful.

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So even as you're
cutting a tomato

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to put on your paleo bread for
lunch, as you're cutting it

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the tomato and
think about the farmer that

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.350 align:middle line:84%
grew it that you bought
from your farmers markets

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:35.310 align:middle line:84%
that morning, looking at the
four chambers of that tomato

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:36.910 align:middle line:84%
as you're cutting
it, and realizing

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that the nutrients
in that tomato

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.070 align:middle line:84%
are talking to you in
the shape that tomatoes

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.365 align:middle line:84%
are wonderful for the
heart, we call that

00:49:44.365 --> 00:49:45.490 align:middle line:90%
the doctrine of signatures.

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Plants and foods are
constantly talking to us.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Just even saying
that or being mindful

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:53.050 align:middle line:84%
of how a walnut
looks like the brain

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.690 align:middle line:84%
is mindfulness,
which is meditation.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to sit
there for an hour saying ohm.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.150 align:middle line:84%
It could just simply taking
a deep breath and saying,

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.320 align:middle line:90%
I am love.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.660 align:middle line:90%
That is meditation.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think as a busy
woman, a mom, and anyone

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:10.060 align:middle line:84%
out there who is frantic
in life or feeling

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.310 align:middle line:84%
like life is frantic
to them, then

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:15.790 align:middle line:84%
it's those small what I call
micromoments of mindfulness

00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:17.500 align:middle line:90%
that is an act of self-care.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It's about space, silence.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's about giving yourself that
solitude, those moments that

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:27.880 align:middle line:84%
will help refill your
cup so that you can

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.710 align:middle line:90%
get through the next breath.

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I always say, moment by moment,
breath by breath, day by day,

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.960 align:middle line:90%
I've got this.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.877 align:middle line:84%
And even in the moments
I haven't, I will then

00:50:36.877 --> 00:50:39.252 align:middle line:84%
remind myself I just got
through that moment, so in fact,

00:50:39.252 --> 00:50:40.090 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:41.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm still here.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:42.880 align:middle line:90%
You are still here.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You have got through the
worst moments in your life.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.300 align:middle line:90%
You're still here.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, in hindsight
when we look back

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.880 align:middle line:84%
at those times that have been
really challenging, I would

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.360 align:middle line:84%
almost suggest that anything
that's been challenging to you

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.270 align:middle line:84%
in your life that you look back
on, when you look back on it

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:01.450 align:middle line:84%
with hindsight, you could
almost say, yes, it was a gift.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Or, it is because of
that I have actually

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:84%
created this in my life,
or I've become that,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.600 align:middle line:84%
or I have met this person,
or I have studied that.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.027 align:middle line:84%
There is a gift in
every challenge.

00:51:13.027 --> 00:51:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just whether or
not we're willing to be

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.930 align:middle line:84%
open to having the
perception that we

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:19.750 align:middle line:84%
deserve the truth
and the pathway

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.190 align:middle line:84%
to finding that
new way of being.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, it is
through the powerful mastery

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.690 align:middle line:84%
of our spiritual leaders
that they will also

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:31.090 align:middle line:84%
say that that is
part of the pathway.

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Struggle is the pathway to self,
to god, to universe, to source.

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Kim, you are
a force for good.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:41.900 align:middle line:90%
You're a force for god.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful to have
you as a friend in my life

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:46.303 align:middle line:84%
even though I don't get
to catch up with you

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:47.740 align:middle line:90%
as much as I'd like to--

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.240 align:middle line:90%
hopefully more.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for sharing today.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.100 align:middle line:84%
It's been an honor to speak
with you on this topic

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and to see you go deeper in
your experience of teaching this

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.540 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:51:58.540 --> 00:51:59.415 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:51:59.415 --> 00:52:00.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolute pleasure.

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:01.270 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.620 align:middle line:10%
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:13.000 align:middle line:90%
