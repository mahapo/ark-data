00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, the big thing that
drove me into the natural

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.390 align:middle line:84%
health field is a health
crisis in my own family,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and I see this a lot with
other health professionals.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But when I was in
eighth grade, my mom

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.683 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed with
cancer, and we

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:26.850 align:middle line:84%
went through all the
traditional medical treatments.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.460 align:middle line:84%
We lived in what I
call the medical model,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and she went and had a
mastectomy, chemotherapy,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and praise God,
she got through it

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:90%
and was diagnosis cancer free.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
But really after she went
through the conventional

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%
medical system, she was sicker.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
She started having
thyroid problems,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.732 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune disease,
chronic digestive issues,

00:00:45.732 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
struggled with
clinical depression,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
got put on three medications
and this went on for 10 years.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And after 10 years,
I was actually

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.928 align:middle line:90%
working as a nutritionist.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I was in chiropractic
college working

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
on getting a natural
medicine certification

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
and she called me and
said, I've got bad news.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I've been diagnosed
with cancer again.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And this time, though, I flew
home and we prayed together

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and we felt led to take
care of her all naturally,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and we started doing things
like juicing vegetables

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
every single day, eating
blueberries, bone broth,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and these foods every single
day transformed her lifestyle.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And after four months, we
went back to the oncologist,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.245 align:middle line:90%
and he said, this is incredible.

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen this,
he said, but the tumors

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:90%
have shrunk in half.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:90%
He said, come back a year later.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Went back a year later, she
was in complete remission,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.703 align:middle line:84%
and today, my mom
is in her mid 60s

00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and she's in the best
shape of her life.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.850 align:middle line:84%
She water skis, she
runs 5Ks with me

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:90%
and just is doing amazing.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
She says she feels better
now in her 60s then

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:90%
she did in her 30s.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So really that experience
with my mom overcoming cancer

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.982 align:middle line:84%
naturally is really a big part
of what drove me to the health

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:84%
field and what's caused me to
practice like I do every day.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
tell all my patients is I'm

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
going to take care
of you like I would

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
my very own mom and my
very own family members.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
That's really the way I
practice and what I teach today.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
Well, the biggest thing that
I teach my patients is food

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:90%
is medicine.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It can be your
greatest form of poison

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
or the thing that can
help cure your body,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And so every time
we take a bite,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.517 align:middle line:84%
anytime we sit down for a meal,
we should think about that.

00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:90%
How do you use food as medicine?

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I've had the opportunity to
work with Olympic-level athletes

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.957 align:middle line:84%
and working with them on
their diet and nutrition.

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
love about working

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:90%
with these professionals--

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.635 align:middle line:84%
I was working back in 2009 with
some swimmers who were going on

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
to be Olympians, and the thing
I loved is that they were always

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.068 align:middle line:84%
coming up to me
asking, Dr. Axe, what

00:02:38.068 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:84%
do I got to eat right before I
workout and right after to get

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:90%
just a split second faster?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're competing for
these physical gold medals,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
but everybody should be
eating that same way.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
We're competing for crowns in
heaven or to serve our family

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
or serve humanity, and so
the big thing that I just say

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is eat like an
Olympian and really

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
focus on this meal you're
putting in your body.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.997 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to be
better because of that?

00:03:01.997 --> 00:03:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an important
thing to remember.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of the
industry today, we're

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:90%
in a really unique place.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
We have more toxic,
processed food

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:84%
than ever in the
history of the world.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we
actually have more access

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to the world's superfoods
than ever before.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, never before could we
ship in berries from the Amazon

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:84%
rainforest and these really
incredible medicinal mushrooms

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.848 align:middle line:84%
like Chaga from Russia and
chia from Mexico and South

00:03:32.848 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
America and all these
different superfoods.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
I see a lot of times,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
even in patients
today, is some of them

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of America or the world
today, in general, the world

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:84%
keeps getting sicker the
people that just decide

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:84%
to eat what's offered them,
versus those people that

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.705 align:middle line:84%
are really proactive and
think like Olympians.

00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
They're the people
that can go and live

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.770 align:middle line:84%
to be over 100 years old
because they have access

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:90%
to all these superfoods.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.715 align:middle line:90%

00:04:03.795 --> 00:04:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Some of the biggest
autoimmune diseases

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.385 align:middle line:84%
that are linked to gut
issues include all of them--

00:04:09.385 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
really, I would say, some
of the biggest conditions

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
are rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,
scleroderma, fibromyalgia,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.753 align:middle line:84%
MS are some big ones,
and so-- and those

00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
are things I take care of
in my clinic all the time,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and probably the
biggest one overall

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
is Hashimoto's thyroiditis
and thyroid disease.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't know this,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
but I would estimate
80% or more of people

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.340 align:middle line:84%
with hypothyroidism actually
have the autoimmune form

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.525 align:middle line:90%
of Hashimoto's disease.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.229 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We now know, through
clinical research,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
it is an absolute that
autoimmune disease

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:90%
begins in the gut.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Just as Hippocrates said
over 2,000 years ago,

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.572 align:middle line:84%
all disease begins in the gut,
so does autoimmune disease.

00:04:53.572 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So with autoimmune disease
here's really how it works

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
is there is a barrier in
between your bloodstream

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:90%
and your intestines.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
It's called your gut
lining, and your gut lining

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.598 align:middle line:84%
has microscopic-- these
little holes in it.

00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:05.140 align:middle line:84%
What can happen over
time if somebody

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
has intestinal inflammation,
it opens up in large holes,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:90%
open up in your gut lining.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So what can happen
now is undigested

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
food particles, such as gluten,
casein, toxins, bad bacteria,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Candida can leak
from the intestines

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.835 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Your body says those
shouldn't be here,

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
it starts this immune response
and if that isn't corrected

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
over time, what can happen is
it starts autoimmune disease,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and that systemic inflammation
can affect the joints, causing

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:90%
rheumatoid arthritis.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It can affect the
thyroid causing

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It can affect the their
colon, causing things

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.540 align:middle line:84%
like Crohn's disease or the
muscles causing fibromyalgia.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So really all autoimmune disease
is first caused by leaky gut.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.660 align:middle line:90%
It starts in the gut lining.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
so often today is

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
patients are going to the
doctors with, let's say,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:90%
an autoimmune disease--

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:90%
let's say Hashimoto thyroiditis.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.850 align:middle line:90%
They're treated in two ways.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Either they try and
suppress the immune system

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
or they try to directly
treat the thyroid.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The key is you heal
the gut lining,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:90%
the thyroid will naturally heal.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.100 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
the biggest factors

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:84%
that are causing this
gut reaction or leaky

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
gut in the body that causes
autoimmune disease are number

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:90%
one, it's certain foods.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Sugar is a big one.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Sugar feeds Candida
and yeast in your body,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.010 align:middle line:90%
which causes this issue.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Genetically modified
organisms that

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
are wired with pesticides
and viruses, which kill off

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
beneficial microbes
in the gut, causing

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
leaky gut and
autoimmune disease,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
also looking at hydrogenated
oils, refined grain products,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.862 align:middle line:84%
artificial sweeteners
are a big one.

00:06:47.862 --> 00:06:50.070 align:middle line:84%
All of these things contribute
to leaky gut and then,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
of course, gluten and casein,
found in products like wheat,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.540 align:middle line:84%
conventional dairy products,
absolutely harm and damage

the gut lining are big ones.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But maybe the biggest
thing that causes

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
leaky gut and autoimmune disease
is actually emotional stress.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Emotional stress
is huge and when

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
somebody has the emotions of,
whether it's fear or anxiety

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:84%
or just being overwhelmed
or frustrated,

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
it actually changes the
hormones within your body.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It makes your gut microbes
more susceptible to damage,

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.318 align:middle line:84%
which then can cause leaky
gut, which then over time

00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:22.485 align:middle line:90%
leads to autoimmune disease.

00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:24.183 align:middle line:90%

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
My personal belief
system is this--

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.850 align:middle line:84%
is that there is good wheat
and there's bad wheat.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.940 align:middle line:84%
There's grass fed
organic beef and there's

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:84%
grain fed GMO conventional
beef, so I really

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
think there's a difference
between the products.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we're looking at
an ancient einkorn wheat that's

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
sprouted and then slow cooked
for a long period of time,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:84%
like it was done in the
Bible, like it was done

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
in Chinese medicine, like it's
done in the Middle East still

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
today, if it's
properly prepared,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I believe it can
be easy to digest.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
There's studies showing
that lacto-fermented,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
so fermented grains and
gluten, actually may not

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.350 align:middle line:84%
affect celiacs, like
other types of grain,

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
so I actually truly
believe that the biggest

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
thing is that we're not
preparing our foods properly.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, do I believe that
necessarily even whole grain,

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
sprouted wheat, is
a therapeutic food

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
when I recommend it to somebody
that's chronically ill?

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.005 align:middle line:84%
No, I don't think it's the best
most therapeutic food for that.

00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I think it's bone broth, it's
vegetables, it's berries,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
it's herbs, getting
more of those things,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
but in general, I think if
somebody's body is healthy

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:84%
or, let's say, they're not
struggling with a major health

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
issue, I think doing a
sprouted, slow cooked,

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle line:90%
ancient grain can be healthy.

00:08:46.883 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I would say the biggest
issue with sugar

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
is that it feeds bad
microbes in the body,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.020 align:middle line:90%
such as yeast and Candida.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.020 align:middle line:84%
What happens if somebody
has Candida overgrowth,

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
it starts to crowd out the
good bacteria in the gut.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And something a lot of
people don't realize

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is that Candida and
yeast over time,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.510 align:middle line:84%
they start producing
toxins that eat away

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
at the gut lining
causing leaky gut, which

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:90%
leads to autoimmune disease.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So sugar is absolutely,
if not number one,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:84%
it's definitely one
of the top three foods

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
that will directly
cause autoimmune disease

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:90%
and leaky gut.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.654 align:middle line:90%

00:09:18.654 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I believe Tom Brady
is absolutely right.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.355 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
Tom Brady, his age

00:09:28.355 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
at being a quarterback and
this effective is really--

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
we've never seen
it before, and so

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
for somebody who is actually
living what he's preaching,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:90%
I think it says a lot.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So with Tom Brady saying
that some of these large food

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
companies out there putting
these cereals that are loaded

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:84%
with sugar, these sodas that
are loaded with sugar-- and not

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.198 align:middle line:84%
just sugar, genetically
modified highly-processed sugar,

00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:55.740 align:middle line:84%
it absolutely-- it's
villainous to me

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
that companies are still
putting this out there.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:84%
It's toxic to
children, especially,

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.443 align:middle line:90%
so I'm on board with Tom Brady.

00:10:02.443 --> 00:10:03.360 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I believe the ultimate
diet for humans

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is a traditional diet
or something very

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
similar to a diet
that was practiced

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.640 align:middle line:90%
as part of Chinese medicine.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:84%
You look at areas of Asia that
have some of the longest life

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:84%
expectancy in the world
and what they recommend

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.340 align:middle line:84%
as a big part of their diet is
doing a lot of broths, chicken

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
broth and fish broth,
which is loaded

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.310 align:middle line:84%
with collagen, which actually
slows the aging process.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:90%
It's very high in antioxidants.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And tea, such as green
tea and white tea,

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:84%
which is therapeutic to the
body, very high-end vegetables,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:84%
half of the plate should be
vegetables, whether it's cooked

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
or raw or fermented
vegetables, are incredible,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
such as sauerkraut or
kimchi, which is often

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:90%
consumed in Asia today.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And then wild-caught meats such
as wild-caught salmon and fish

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
packed with omega-3 fats,
which reduce inflammation,

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.560 align:middle line:84%
antioxidants like
astaxanthin, so I really

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:84%
believe people's diets should be
loaded with vegetables, fruits,

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
bone broth, wild-caught
meat and last,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:84%
but certainly not
least, herbs and spices.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.840 align:middle line:84%
When you walk into someone's
home who's in the Middle East,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.833 align:middle line:84%
you can typically smell in
their kitchen herbs and spices.

00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
This is something
we're completely

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:84%
missing today in areas such
as America, Canada, Europe,

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Australia.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
We're not using enough
herbs and spices

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.350 align:middle line:84%
like our eastern
counterparts, and so

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:84%
adding more things like
cinnamon, ginger, turmeric,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
rosemary, more of these
herbs and spices in our diet.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.890 align:middle line:84%
They are the most
powerful cancer fighters.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:84%
They're the most powerful
anti-inflammatories,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and everybody who is trying
to combat autoimmune disease

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:84%
or any type of
illness can benefit

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
from getting more herbs
and spices into their diet.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Essential oils were used
in biblical medicine.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.000 align:middle line:84%
They're referenced
more than 300 times.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine,
Greek medicine,

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean they were part of the
cultures during that time,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and they've been proven
for thousands of years

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to probably be the most powerful
form of plant-based medicine

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.190 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And essential oils are
created by extracting

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.843 align:middle line:84%
the water soluble from
the fat soluble compounds,

00:12:15.843 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:84%
but not just the
fat soluble, it's

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:84%
the very light and aromatic
fat soluble compounds that

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:84%
are 1,000 times smaller than
most of the fats you'd find

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:84%
in olive oil or coconut
oil, and the thing that

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
makes them unique is
because they're so small,

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.680 align:middle line:90%
they're transdermal.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
They can actually pass through
the skin into the bloodstream.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Also, you can inhale them.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
They can pass through
the blood-brain barrier,

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:84%
affecting the brain, and that's
why certain essential oils,

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
like frankincense, are
so powerful for their

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:90%
anti-inflammatory properties.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.940 align:middle line:84%
They reduce neural and
brain inflammation.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They reduce inflammation
throughout the entire body

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and help modulate
the immune system,

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:84%
so if somebody has
autoimmune disease,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.420 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest
essential oils I recommend

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
is frankincense
because of its ability

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
to support the immune system
and overall cellular health.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:90%
I also love lavender oil.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Lavender oil acts
as an adaptogen

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:84%
by lowering cortisol
levels and stressors.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Great medical studies on
this also balancing out

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
insulin and blood sugar
levels, so lavender

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is another powerful essential
oil, and even peppermint.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
There are over 1,000
clinical studies done

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.940 align:middle line:84%
on peppermint essential
oil, and even a great study

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:84%
on its ability to fight
IBS, an autoimmune disease

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:84%
within the gut,
so essential oils

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.500 align:middle line:84%
are a powerful form of
medicine that I believe

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:90%
everybody should be using.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And another great
benefit of essential oils

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
is by using them in your
personal care products.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:90%
You're reducing toxicity.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.563 align:middle line:84%
So many people are putting
things on their body and skin

00:13:40.563 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:90%
that are toxic.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I make my own homemade
shampoo using aloe vera gel

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and rosemary oil, which helps
naturally thicken the hair.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I make my own skin cream
using Shea butter and myrrh

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:84%
oil and geranium and lavender
as a combination on my skin.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I make my own homemade
deodorant with sandalwood oil,

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.893 align:middle line:90%
baking soda, coconut oil.

00:13:59.893 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So another great thing
is that they absolutely

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:90%
reduce toxicity.

00:14:10.932 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the reasons why
peppermint oil is so effective

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.203 align:middle line:84%
is it has a cooling
effect on the body,

00:14:15.203 --> 00:14:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and what happens is-- just
even think about this yourself.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:84%
When you get really hot,
you start to get fatigued.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:90%
It starts to overrun your body.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
The great thing
about peppermint oil

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is it cools the body, which
actually allows your body

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
to perform at a higher
level so it can absolutely

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.407 align:middle line:90%
oxygenate your system.

00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to mention this-- there
was a great clinical trial done

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:84%
recently and they actually
found that those who just simply

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
smelled peppermint oil before
a day's work had better focus

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and concentration
than those who didn't.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And I actually had a professor
who e-mailed me recently

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and he said Dr. Axe, I do a
special formula and combination

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:90%
for my students before tests.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of peppermint
oil, vetiver, cedarwood,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and rosemary that he
says, I've actually

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
found it actually helps
improve the test performance

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:90%
of the students I work with.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.820 align:middle line:90%
The other thing that--

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.528 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just
sort of a side note,

00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
but if you think about certain
medications or personal care

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:84%
products people use
today like Icy Hot,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Icy Hot is essentially
taking compounds

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:84%
that are found in things like
peppermint and wintergreen,

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:84%
combining it with
other compounds that

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:84%
are found in things like
ginger and cayenne pepper.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's icy-- peppermint,
and wintergreen

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
have those compounds that help
cool and restrict vessels,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:84%
whereas ginger and cayenne warm
the body and help open it up.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I sprained my ankle when
I was in high school

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:84%
and it would swell up, and
they did hot-cold therapy,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
where I put an ice bucket,
and then I put it in a hot tub

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.275 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:15:37.275 --> 00:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happens when
you use essential oils.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.490 align:middle line:84%
If you use an essential oil
like black pepper and ginger

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
plus oils like wintergreen
and peppermint,

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:84%
it does that sort
of constriction,

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.623 align:middle line:84%
helps get fluid and flush
fluid from the area.

00:15:48.623 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty incredible when
you look at, really, again,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.360 align:middle line:90%
it's plant-based medicine.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.272 align:middle line:90%

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't realize
that certain emotions actually

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.485 align:middle line:84%
cause disease in
specific organs.

00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
This has been known
in Chinese medicine

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.068 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:16:07.068 --> 00:16:10.537 align:middle line:84%
Emotions of fear affect
the reproductive organs,

00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:90%
the kidneys, and adrenals.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.287 align:middle line:84%
Think about this--
if somebody has fear,

00:16:13.287 --> 00:16:16.115 align:middle line:84%
like a child gets really
scared, they can wet themselves.

00:16:16.115 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Why does that happen?

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Fear directly affects the
bladder and the kidneys,

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:90%
causing that to happen.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is experiencing
the emotions of frustration

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and anger, it's
toxic to the liver.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is
experiencing emotions

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:84%
of grief and sadness
and depression,

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.853 align:middle line:84%
maybe they lost a spouse
or went through a divorce

00:16:31.853 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
or had a trying time
in their life, that

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
affects the colon and the lungs,
which is your immune system.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has anxiety
and nervousness,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
it affects the heart,
the small intestine,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:90%
and the nerve system.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody
is a big worrier,

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:84%
it affects the
spleen, the pancreas,

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.280 align:middle line:90%
as well as the stomach.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:54.012 align:middle line:84%
And so specific emotions drive
disease in specific organs,

00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you from working
with thousands of patients,

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
taking care of the
emotional aspect of health

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
is just as important,
if not more important,

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.359 align:middle line:90%
than changing the diet.

00:17:03.359 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with,
again, a lot of patients

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.940 align:middle line:84%
with this who have
suffered with disease,

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and if people can really
combat those emotions-- when

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:84%
my mom was diagnosed
with cancer,

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:84%
she specifically had a lot of
emotions of fear and anxiety,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:84%
so we actually-- here's a
exercise that helps really

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:90%
transform the mind.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:84%
She started writing
down affirmations

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
that were positive, taking Bible
verses and positive quotes.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
She took out a
recorder and recorded

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
herself saying these healing
verses and proverbs and quotes.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
She listened to it every morning
when she first woke up and then

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:90%
every night before bed.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And she did this and I believe
that it was the key, really

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.023 align:middle line:84%
the secret, to her overcoming
autoimmune disease, cancer,

00:17:42.023 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and all the health problems
she was struggling with.

00:17:46.122 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:55.530 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is really looking
to reduce stress, transform

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
their mind, combat fear,
anxiety depression,

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.310 align:middle line:84%
these negative emotions, I
recommend several things.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Number one, scheduling
time for you.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So many people today,
moms especially, they

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:90%
have zero mom time.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.413 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're taking the
kids to sports practice,

00:18:09.413 --> 00:18:10.330 align:middle line:90%
they're maybe working.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They're taking care
of a whole family.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:90%
They get no time to themselves.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Blocking off you time to where
you're doing things you love.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's lunch
with a best friend.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's out walking.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's shopping at the mall.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is,
taking time for you.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I
recommend is healing bath

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
with essential oils
and Epsom salts.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Epsom salts contain magnesium,
known as the relaxation

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:84%
mineral, so one cup of those,
20 drops of a relaxing essential

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.170 align:middle line:90%
oil, such as lavender.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Soaking in a bath for 20
minutes every single night

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.830 align:middle line:84%
is so great for naturally
relieving stress.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.990 align:middle line:84%
I would say, as well,
one of my secret weapons

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:84%
for my patients is doing
a spiritual triathlon

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:84%
In the morning
spending five minutes

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.230 align:middle line:84%
of doing each of these--
five minutes being grateful,

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
just saying everything you're
grateful for, another five

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:84%
minutes reading something
positive, maybe it's

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
the Bible maybe it's a positive
quote or personal growth

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
book, and then five minutes
in prayer or meditation,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:84%
thinking about how this
principle you've just

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:84%
read about is going to
positively affect you,

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:84%
of your life, visualizing
how your day is going.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.245 align:middle line:84%
Doing that spiritual
triathlon can absolutely

00:19:16.245 --> 00:19:17.370 align:middle line:90%
transform someone's health.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have a history
of doing triathlons,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and I can just tell you every--
and I started doing this

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:84%
and when I started doing
a spiritual triathlon,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
it completely
transformed my life.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.854 align:middle line:90%

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I think visualization is
probably the most powerful tool

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:90%
out there today.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a few
examples with my mom, who

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.840 align:middle line:90%
was fighting cancer.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:84%
She would visualize herself
running around on a beach,

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.870 align:middle line:84%
playing with her grandkids,
bringing her grandkids

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.738 align:middle line:84%
to Disney, running
5Ks and winning them,

00:19:49.738 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and just having
extraordinary health.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
She also visualized
her immune cells

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
going and gobbling up
cancer cells and toxic cells

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.920 align:middle line:84%
within the body, so she
visualized that and she healed.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
In my own life, I can
tell you from goal setting

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and having certain things I
needed to overcome in life,

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, every time I visualize
and set specific goals,

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it coming to
fruition every single time.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:14.928 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
visualization is

00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:84%
one of the most powerful tools
at naturally healing the body.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:90%

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're seeing
a lot of research now coming

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:84%
into where the mind
affects the body,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.265 align:middle line:84%
the body affects the mind,
and in order to heal the body,

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:34.640 align:middle line:84%
we've got to start
with the mind.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:90%
It's our most important tool.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Today, we know that by simply
experiencing certain emotions,

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
it causes a flood of different
certain hormones in the body.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.837 align:middle line:84%
If you experience-- if
you're watching a movie

00:20:44.837 --> 00:20:46.385 align:middle line:84%
and you start
laughing, serotonin

00:20:46.385 --> 00:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
starts flooding
throughout your system.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's incredible.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
If you experience anxiety,
or you start getting worried

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:84%
about something,
immediately cortisol

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.810 align:middle line:84%
starts rising the body, which
is known as your aging hormone.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So positive emotions
versus negative emotions,

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
they're more powerful
than any drug.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
They're more powerful
than any food.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Having positive emotions
is an absolute key

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:90%
to fighting disease naturally.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely believe finding
lasting fulfillment is

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:90%
a couple of things.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
One, it's having a connection
to your maker, to God,

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's fulfilling
your purpose in life.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So many people
today, I think part

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
of the reason why there's
disease and illnesses,

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:90%
people don't have a purpose.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.162 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I didn't
wake up every day

00:21:31.162 --> 00:21:34.562 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know what I was
here for, I would get lost.

00:21:34.562 --> 00:21:35.520 align:middle line:90%
I would feel depressed.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
For myself, I know that
I'm called to win my race,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:90%
live my best life possible.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I know that God has put me here
to help people get healthy.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:90%
That's my mission.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that's
my God-given calling,

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I get excited every morning.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.848 align:middle line:90%
I know that I have a mission.

00:21:49.848 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm able to add value to people.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So knowing those two
things, number one,

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I have a maker who
created me for good.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
He absolutely loves me,
and being connected to God,

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.868 align:middle line:84%
having a relationship
with him, knowing I

00:22:00.868 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:84%
can go there and just talk
to him, have a conversation,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:84%
he cares about my life
and what's going on.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the most important,
fulfilling thing in my life,

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and knowing I'm called
to serve people.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm called to love
God and love man,

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and so, again, going out
there and loving people

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.800 align:middle line:84%
the best way I can and
knowing that's my purpose.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.405 align:middle line:84%
It's what fulfills
me personally.

00:22:19.405 --> 00:22:21.157 align:middle line:90%

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I would say in terms
of in order for people

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.240 align:middle line:84%
to discover and learn their
purpose, take a minute

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:90%
and write down your strengths.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Write down past
successes you've had.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Start to look at what
your strengths are.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.355 align:middle line:84%
Also, go to people
that you care about,

00:22:38.355 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:84%
not people that are negative,
but people that you respect,

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
people that are positive,
encouraging, and ask them,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.500 align:middle line:84%
well, just be honest with me
what do you think I'm good at?

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
my strengths are?

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:52.563 align:middle line:84%
So self-reflection, getting
advice from mentors and others

00:22:52.563 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
good at, I think

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that's one way you
start to discover.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, sometimes, it's
through trial and error.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean you start going
out there and recognizing

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:84%
mentors or people who are
doing what you want to do.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.222 align:middle line:84%
I remember doing this
years ago, seeing somebody

00:23:06.222 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
who had a really popular health
website, he was a physician

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.572 align:middle line:90%
and saying, I want to do that.

00:23:10.572 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I want to do what he's doing.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
great way to start

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
to recognize your own
strengths, your own passion,

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:90%
your own purpose in life.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.257 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is
through visualization.

00:23:19.257 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I did
is I would just sit down I

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:84%
would start praying to
God, and I said, God,

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:84%
would you just show me what
you have for your life?

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose?

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you have for me?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.873 align:middle line:84%
And just sitting there
meditating for minutes,

00:23:29.873 --> 00:23:32.290 align:middle line:84%
sometimes hours, and really
just thinking, visualizing it,

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:84%
it's another great way
to discover your purpose.
