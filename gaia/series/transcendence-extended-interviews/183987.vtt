[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, It's James here
from "Food Matters,"

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and today we have an
extra-special guest for you.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.810 align:middle line:84%
His name is Rich Roll, and
this gentleman's transformation

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.440 align:middle line:84%
story is like none of you
have ever heard before.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.200 align:middle line:84%
He went from being addicted
to fast food and on the couch,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
to being one of the most
respected ultra distance

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:90%
athletes in the world.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And his story will have so
many profound impacts for you

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:84%
from a perspective of
food and also mindset.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be a great chat.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Rich, how are you?

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited to talk to you.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Same here.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to take us
back to the beginning

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.666 align:middle line:90%
of your transformation.

00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I love
your transformation,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
because there's a common thread
in a lot of transformations.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Started with pain.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about what it was like
living that old life of yours,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
being that old you,
and that wake-up

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:84%
call that you had to
transform your life.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, pain is the ultimate
motivator, is it not?

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, throughout my 30s,
I was a corporate lawyer,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:84%
doing my best to
climb that ladder

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:90%
towards the American dream.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I had spent the
better part of my life chasing

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:84%
that American dream
without ever really

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.900 align:middle line:84%
mindfully thinking about what
I wanted to do with my life.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a very persistent,
diligent, hardworking

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And I have a history of
addiction and alcoholism.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'd gotten sober at 31, and
in the wake of that experience,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
having sort of
decimated my life,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I was very intent on
rebuilding and repairing it

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and kind of getting
back on track.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And I threw all of those
addictive tendencies

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
into my profession,
so I was working 60-

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to 80-hour weeks for many
years, and I wasn't taking

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:90%
care of myself physically.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I'd become a junk food addict.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I was not exercising
at all despite the fact

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been a
swimmer in college.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time I was 39,
I was 50 pounds overweight.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.102 align:middle line:90%
I was never morbidly obese.

00:02:13.102 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I was just kind of like
a chunky guy, a guy who

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.435 align:middle line:84%
looks like he's
probably spending

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:84%
too much time riding elevators
and working in an office.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And it all caught
up to me shortly

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:90%
before my 40th birthday.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I think beyond kind of just
being overweight and not

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
treating myself very kindly,
I was also very depressed.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I was unenthusiastic
about this path in life

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
that I thought
that I had chosen,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like
now in retrospect

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:90%
chose me more than I chose it.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And there was a lot of
confusion in my life

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:90%
about what I was doing.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:90%
I was sort of in freefall.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And that collided
with the health scare

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:84%
late one evening as
I was making my way

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:84%
up a simple flight of stairs,
where I literally had to pause.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I was so winded, I could not
complete just a simple flight

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
of stairs without
taking a break.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And I had tightness in my
chest, and shortness of breath,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and sweat on my brow and
really, like, fear in my heart

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
that I was on the precipice
of having a heart incident.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Heart disease runs in my family.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, who
also was a champion

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
swimmer in his own right, had
died at an early age of a heart

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:84%
attack, and my whole life
my mother would say you,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
gotta watch what you
eat and be careful.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of like blah,
blah, blah when you're young.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But it all became very crystal
clear to me in that moment,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:84%
not only that I needed to
change how I was living,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
how I was behaving,
how I was prioritizing

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
my time and my energy,
but also that I

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:90%
wanted to make that change.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I had a willingness to
take a leap of faith

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:90%
and try something different.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> At that moment, was it clear
to you that you had a pathway

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:90%
as to what to do next?

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not normally clear.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:84%
How did you develop an
idea about the next step

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to take when you had
this motivator of pain?

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's funny.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
When you look backwards in
time from where I sit now,

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:84%
it all makes perfect sense and
looks like those dominoes line

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.000 align:middle line:90%
up perfectly.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you, in the midst
of that experience it was all

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:90%
very confusing.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:90%
There was no clear path.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.260 align:middle line:84%
All I was doing was trying to
make the next best decision

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
and trying to learn
along the way.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I was clear that
I needed to change

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.590 align:middle line:84%
my relationship with
food, and so that

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:90%
was my first order of business.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing that I
did was a seven-day fruit

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and vegetable juice cleanse,
which was crazy at the time.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.505 align:middle line:84%
It was so out of left field from
anything I'd ever experienced.

00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd never gone a single
day in my entire life

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.970 align:middle line:90%
without eating solid food.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that that was
something that would kind

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:90%
of shock me out of my habits.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It didn't have to do with
detoxing or any of that,

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I just needed to do something
extreme to kind of reframe

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:90%
my relationship with food.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
effective in that regard.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Over that seven-day
period I can remember

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
lying on the couch, being
listless and sweating

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, how am I going
to make it through the day?

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But the remarkable
thing is that at the end

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
of that one-week period, I
felt completely revitalized.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I had a resurgence of vitality
and energy and mental clarity

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't experienced
since I was a young person.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And it made it very
clear to me just how

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
potent the foods that
we're taking into our body

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
are, and the relationship to
how we feel and how we behave

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and how we think and how
we interact with others.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that sort of catalyzed
the interest and the intention

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to look a little bit
more deeply into food.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was certainly not a
linear path for me whatsoever.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of all over the
map, trying different things--

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.690 align:middle line:84%
unsuccessfully for
the most part--

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
and played that out
for six or seven months

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.310 align:middle line:84%
before I finally
decided that I was

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.690 align:middle line:84%
going to try a 100% plant-based
diet, which was something

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:84%
that I was not
excited about doing.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of the
last box to check

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
before going back to eating
cheeseburgers and saying,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
I tried everything.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have
high expectations

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.735 align:middle line:84%
that it would make me
feel any different.

00:06:21.735 --> 00:06:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I was in search
of trying to feel

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:84%
like I did on that seventh
day of that cleanse.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, how can I eat
on a daily basis

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
that will allow me to have
that sense of vitality?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to recapture that.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered was
that within a week or 10 days

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
of adopting a 100% whole
food, plant-based diet,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to
recapture that feeling.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:90%
I felt incredible.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I knew I'd kind
of haphazardly and imperfectly

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
stumbled into something that
was quite powerful for me.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, this was
before "Forks Over Knives"

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:90%
and before the Engine 2 diet.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
There was certainly plenty
of resources available to me

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
at the time, but there was not
the awareness in a mainstream

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:90%
context that we have today.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> When you first transitioned
to this plant-based diet,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
were you eating a
vegan junk food diet?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Or were you eating a
real plant foods diet?

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you come off
a seven-day cleanse,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.272 align:middle line:84%
but I just know
that so many people

00:07:26.272 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
when they transition
they're like, I'm a vegan.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
they're a junk food vegan.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
different takes on that.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
How was your experimentation
with these different sort

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:84%
of delineations of
plant-based diet,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.093 align:middle line:84%
and how did you settle on being
at the stage you're at now?

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Or at that stage
that prepared you

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:84%
to tackle some of these
events that you got to?

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It's never been easier
to be a junk food vegan,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and I think there's a lot of
confusion where we conflate

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:84%
a vegan diet with health
without really appropriately

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
understanding the difference
between what is a real

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
healthful food and
what is a junk food.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn that the hard
way in my six- or seven-month

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
experimentation with a
variety of different diets.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I kind of had settled
into a vegetarian diet,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.960 align:middle line:84%
but my version of
a vegetarian diet

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:84%
was Pizza Hut pizza
without the pepperoni.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, Taco Bell burritos,
just keep the meat off it.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of, like, processed grains
and potato chips and things

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:84%
And when I-- sort
of playing that out,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:84%
there I was back on the
couch, lazier than ever,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:84%
more dissatisfied
than ever, feeling

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
like I did before that
staircase episode.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that's
not going to work.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So when I made the decision
to go 100% plant-based,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I did it without the junk food.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So I made that leap
from the get-go

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and cleared out all of the
processed foods from the mix.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't like, no oil or super
low fat or anything like that,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.490 align:middle line:84%
but I basically eradicated
99% of the culprit foods

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that would be categorized
as vegan junk food.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.978 align:middle line:84%
And that agreed with
me, and that works.

00:09:16.978 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting, though.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
11 years, and now we

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
see the rise and
the advent of all

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
of these amazing
plant-based alternatives

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:90%
to many meat and dairy products.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wide
spectrum in terms

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
of which of those are healthy
and which of those would really

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:90%
fall under a junk food category.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.407 align:middle line:84%
But it's very easy
to delude yourself

00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
when you're at the market
and you see these things

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.865 align:middle line:84%
and you go, oh,
well, it's vegan,

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:90%
it must be good for you, right?

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:90%
It must be great.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And I plead guilty to enjoying
those foods from time to time,

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
but my guiding
principle, my north star

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
is really plant-based foods as
close to their natural state

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:90%
as possible.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So after this
transformation, you're a lawyer,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:84%
so you're typically
sitting at your desk a lot.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And then what was it that welled
up inside of you that said,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.780 align:middle line:90%
I want to do a triathlon?

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Or even have this idea
of doing the EPIC5?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
not small feats.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did you
build up this idea

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.517 align:middle line:90%
of wanting to do that?

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:19.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was a
couple of things.

00:10:19.975 --> 00:10:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all,
it evolved over time.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, oh,
I went plant-based,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
then the next day I thought,
I'm going to do Ultraman.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It didn't
quite happen like that.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:90%
But I will say this.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
After adopting a
plant-based diet,

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I did have this
resurgence in vitality.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And I had all this
energy for the first time

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:90%
in as long as I could remember.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
So the impulse to actually
move myself physically

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
occurred to me,
which is something

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't felt in a while also.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I started exercising
again, first very casually,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
but I realized very quickly
that I enjoyed that.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big part of
what I was about as a child,

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and something that
I loved very much

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and had really
lost touch with it.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So the first year
was really connecting

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:84%
with that part of who I am
that I had kind of repressed

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of,
well, now I'm an adult

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and adults don't
do these things.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.840 align:middle line:84%
So it was really
nothing more than that.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But I think what it evolved
into was this pursuit of trying

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:90%
to unlock hidden potential.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
In a very short period
of time after changing

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:84%
my relationship with food, I
had completely transformed.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:90%
I lost 50 pounds.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I looked different.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:90%
I felt different.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It was quite radical, and
yet the changes that I made

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:90%
were relatively simple.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And the thought
occurred to me, if I

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.850 align:middle line:84%
could change this drastically,
this dramatically,

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:84%
in such a short
period of time, what

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
are the other areas of my life
that I'm overlooking, where I'm

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%
sitting on top of
mountains of potential

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just not
consciously aware of?

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what lured me
into the world of triathlon

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:84%
initially, and ultimately into
ultra endurance athletics,

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's a
beautiful, robust template

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
to test human potential,
not just physically,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:84%
but mentally, emotionally,
and spiritually as well.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a testing ground that
very few people play with,

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and for you to be
able to take that step

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.510 align:middle line:90%
to do that is remarkable.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
what events sort of unfolded

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:84%
as you started practicing
these triathlons,

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and then leading up to
basically the EPIC5, which is

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:90%
a pretty wild, wild experience.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about what led
up to that and then

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
how you convinced yourself
that that was a fun idea.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, it's also a
very non-linear journey that

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.805 align:middle line:84%
had its ups and downs and
many mistakes along the way.

00:12:47.805 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Like I mentioned, I was
a swimmer in college,

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.890 align:middle line:90%
so I had that background.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And I knew how to
train and push myself.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I sort of got
fitter and more invested

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
in this food adventure
that I was on,

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I started getting more
interested in fitness

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.900 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And I had unfinished business
as a competitive swimmer,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
because alcoholism really
derailed that career

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and I never felt like I achieved
my potential as an athlete.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And so here I was
at 40, 41 years old,

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:84%
having this kind of Renaissance
experience and thinking, well,

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
maybe I can be
competitive again.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's give this a go and
see what I'm capable of.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And I always was
interested in triathlon.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd never raced
a bike, I'd never

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
really done any running
other than casual jogging

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I threw
myself into it, and I

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:90%
thought, how hard can it be?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I know how to
train as a swimmer.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of just created this
self-styled training program

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.540 align:middle line:84%
in this vacuum of my
mind and went at it.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I did a couple
sprint triathlons that,

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.173 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was a
middle-of-the-packer.

00:13:50.173 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
There was no
indication that I was

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
going to be some kind of
crazy ultra endurance athlete.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I stepped it up to
do a half Ironman distance

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:90%
triathlon.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It was a Wildflower race.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:90%
And I think this was 2007.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And that was a disaster.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, I just got out of the
swim, I threw up everywhere.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, got on my
bike and tried to ride,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and everyone just
whizzed past me

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't keep
pace with anybody.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And when the bike
ride was over, I

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
cramped up so much
I couldn't run

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and I just had to
pull out of the race.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So my point being that
there was no indication

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to have
this future as an athlete.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But I just kept at it,
and I hired a coach,

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.067 align:middle line:84%
and I got more and
more interested

00:14:32.067 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and I got more and more
scientific in my approach

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
not just to training, but to
how the foods I was eating

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
were playing into
that equation as well.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.680 align:middle line:90%
And set a course.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, I read this article
about this crazy race Ultraman.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It was like a light switch went
off in my mind and I thought,

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:90%
that's the race for me.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not logical at all.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:84%
My only experience in
trying to do anything other

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.730 align:middle line:84%
than a sprint triathlon
ended up in total failure,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
so I had no business, really,
to responsibly entertain

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
the prospect of trying
something so difficult.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.040 align:middle line:90%
But it kind of--

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.030 align:middle line:90%
it defied rationality.

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It was more like this
bizarre calling that I felt.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:22.765 align:middle line:90%
Like it just felt right.

00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
When I read this article
about this race, Ultraman,

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
which is a double Ironman
distance triathlon that

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
circumnavigates the entire
big island of Hawaii

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.370 align:middle line:90%
over three days--

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.580 align:middle line:84%
it's 320 miles, it's
absolutely bananas--

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that's
what I'm doing.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I could see myself
in my mind lining up

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.070 align:middle line:84%
at the start line, like I
knew it was going to happen.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
It was like a foregone
conclusion, despite the fact

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
that it made no
sense whatsoever.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So you did this
ultramarathon,

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and you placed
quite well, I think.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I think you were, like, sixth
or sixteenth or something?

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my first Ultraman,
I really just went--

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:84%
2008 was my first Ultraman,
and I had one goal.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:90%
And that goal was, don't die.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I was not trying
to win anything.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was very conservative in
my approach and very conscious

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that I was a newcomer
in this sport.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up
being, I think I was

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:90%
the second-fastest American.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I think I was 11th
overall that year.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And far exceeding
my expectations

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and the expectations of everyone
else involved in the event.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what would happen
if I trained a whole year

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and went back to that race fully
prepared with some experience?

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And so in 2009
that's what I did.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was the fastest
American that year

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.226 align:middle line:90%
and was sixth overall.

00:16:42.226 --> 00:16:43.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:16:43.132 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:84%
After that experience, is
that when you decided, great,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
now I'm going to step
it up and do this EPIC5?

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every step seems like
a crazy idea, even crazier

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:90%
than the one before it.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Ultraman was really
driven by this question,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
this quest that I was on, which
was to determine the outer

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
limits of my capabilities,
physically, mentally,

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.190 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, what am
I truly capable of

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
if I really put it on
the line and test myself?

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like that race,
that Ultraman race in 2009,

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I walked away from
that race feeling

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
like I had answered
that question for myself

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.359 align:middle line:84%
and that I didn't need
to explore any further,

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and I would have been perfectly
content to hang it up and say,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, on to the next thing.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.100 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was
my friend Jason Lester,

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.110 align:middle line:84%
who was a training
partner of mine

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and a fellow
competitor in Ultraman,

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.640 align:middle line:84%
a very inspiring
individual who does

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
these crazy races
without the functional

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:90%
use of his right arm.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
He's a challenge
athlete, and he's

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:84%
gone on to do amazing
things, and it was his idea.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, I have this idea for
this crazy thing I want to do.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling it EPIC5,
and it involves

00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:00.760 align:middle line:84%
doing five Ironman triathlons
on five Hawaiian Islands

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:90%
and completing it in five days.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And so he solicited my
participation in this thing.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
At first I was like,
I'm not doing that.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'll help you
out, but that exceeds what

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm capable of, and I'm good.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But he sort of kept after
me, and ultimately I

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.960 align:middle line:84%
realized that perhaps
I had not answered

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:90%
that question for myself.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there was more
work to be done and and

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:90%
depths to be mined.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I agreed
to do it in 2010.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
We set out to do this crazy
thing that no one had ever

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
attempted before,
let alone completed,

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.023 align:middle line:90%
and we accomplished it.

00:18:38.023 --> 00:18:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It took us a little bit
longer than five days.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:84%
We ran into all kinds of
crazy obstacles and things

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:84%
that I talk about in my
book, but ultimately we

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:84%
were successful in
completing five Ironmans

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:90%
on five Hawaiian islands.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
We did it in about
six and a half days.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It was just the two of you?

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Just the two of us.

00:18:55.297 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
We had a ragtag crew of
volunteers and people

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that were helping us out, so
it wasn't just us in isolation,

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
but we were the two people
that actually did it, yeah.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You would have had to have
some crazy jokes or funny

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:84%
things you say to yourself
to just crack you out

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
of the seriousness of the
level of what you were doing.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.203 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did you stay sane
in some of those processes?

00:19:16.203 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, did you sing a
Stevie Wonder song?

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Just the two of us.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
>> There were more than a few
trying moments, I can tell you.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest factor
was sleep deprivation,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
because we had to get
off the island every day.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And we would have to
time these so that we

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.003 align:middle line:84%
would get on the airplane the
last flight off the island

00:19:34.003 --> 00:19:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to get to the next island,
and check into the hotel,

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately we were not
getting very much sleep,

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and that really started to take
its toll the fourth and fifth

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.340 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But the moments of
levity were really

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Jason, you know, every
time we'd hit an obstacle,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Jason would say, that's why
it's called a challenge.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what did you
think you were going to do?

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was going to go wrong?

00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, our bikes broke, we met
every conceivable obstacle

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:90%
And I definitely was--

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
my emotions were
tested to the limit,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
beyond the breaking
point a couple of times.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Jason, I would say,
I have to give him

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
credit for being much
more composed than I

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.370 align:middle line:90%
was throughout the adventure.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.403 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you reflect
on your epic journey,

00:20:18.403 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and all the things
that you've achieved,

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and now the work that you're
doing with the books and with

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
your wife, how do you sort of
relate these epic experiences

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:34.617 align:middle line:84%
and these ultra distance feats
to somebody who might just be

00:20:34.617 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:84%
looking for where you were
looking at first stage,

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:90%
just to get off the couch?

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you make your
story relatable for people?

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we are all--
all of us, without exception--

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
sitting on top of mountains
of untapped human potential

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
just waiting to be
unlocked and unleashed.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And quite frankly, as
Henry David Thoreau said

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.530 align:middle line:84%
so eloquently back in
1888 or whenever it was,

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe the
mass of men lead

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:90%
lives of quiet desperation.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And what is
considered resignation

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:90%
is confirmed desperation.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it was true in his time,
I think it's probably more true

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
There are so many people who are
dissatisfied with their lives.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:84%
They're living their lives
reactively, compulsively,

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and not mindfully
or consciously.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's really not
even their own fault.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:84%
We are living all in
this system that's

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.880 align:middle line:84%
set up to drive us
onto career paths

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:84%
that we're not consciously
choosing for ourselves,

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.380 align:middle line:84%
or that are out of alignment
with who we truly are,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:90%
our authentic blueprint.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky enough
to wake up at 40

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:90%
and embark upon this journey.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And my responsibility
with what I've experienced

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
is to share the facts and the
emotions of that experience

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
with others in hopes that I can
help to activate and catalyze

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
their version of what
I've experienced.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Of course, not everyone wants to
be an ultra endurance athlete.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Ultraman, EPIC5, these
things that I've done,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I consider them to be
allegories or metaphors

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.680 align:middle line:84%
for that untapped
human potential.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And so my hope is
that people can

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
look at those
experiences and my story,

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and draw inspiration from that
to then examine their own lives

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
under a microscope, to better
identify what it is within them

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:90%
that has gone unaddressed.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:84%
That spark, that
little flame of passion

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.010 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps has been
kindling in the soul,

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:90%
yet unaddressed for too long.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And the work that
I do, whether it's

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:84%
through the podcast or
the books or the speaking,

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:84%
is to encourage people to pay
attention to that little voice

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.420 align:middle line:84%
there and to bring expression
to that in your own life,

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and in so doing, to perhaps
connect with yourself more

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
deeply, and ultimately express
a more authentic version of who

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
you are so that you can
live more fulfilled and more

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.666 align:middle line:90%
purposeful and more content.

00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:27.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:27.466 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:90%
So you're not just about food.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but food's
a big part of it.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Food is a very important
piece in this puzzle.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:90%
It should not be overlooked.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the only piece.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:84%
For me, I look at food
as the initial portal

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:84%
that brought me into a
universe of personal growth

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.060 align:middle line:90%
and exploration.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Had I not changed my
relationship with food,

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably still be eating
cheeseburgers at the law firm,

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And by changing the vibration of
what I was putting in my body,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
it activated
something in me that

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:13.170 align:middle line:84%
gave me a sense of self-care and
a deeper connection with who I

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:20.650 align:middle line:84%
am that has then forged, or
encouraged, this path forward.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think everybody
can have their version

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of that experience if you're
more mindful about the choices

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.580 align:middle line:84%
you're making three
times a day about what

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:90%
you're putting in your mouth.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Very well said.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Very well said.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
In reflecting back
on your journey

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and this transformation,
you've centered it

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
around food and then
these sort of step

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
by step, sort of
haphazardly finding your way

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.200 align:middle line:90%
into doing an EPIC5 in a way.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you reflect back on it,
were there any specific mindset

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:84%
rituals or things that you
did that you're like, wow,

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.555 align:middle line:84%
if I hadn't done that, it
wouldn't have probably added up

00:24:58.555 --> 00:24:59.355 align:middle line:90%
to what it was?

00:24:59.355 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:84%
One thing you
touched on, you said

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.600 align:middle line:84%
that you visualized being
at the starting line.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I know that visualization
is a big thing

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of athletes.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, Carl
Lewis used to do it,

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Arnold Schwarzenegger
used to do it.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Novak Djokovic built a trophy
when he was six years old,

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and imagined winning
Wimbledon and becoming

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:84%
number one in the world, and
he did it on the same day,

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:20.780 align:middle line:90%
some 15 years later.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is a lot
to be said about it.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Do you look back
and consider there's

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.102 align:middle line:84%
a lot of sort of
mindfulness, visualization

00:25:27.102 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
components to your journey
that were important?

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, absolutely,
without question.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:34.102 align:middle line:90%
Visualization, absolutely key.

00:25:34.102 --> 00:25:36.560 align:middle line:84%
It's something I learned as a
very young person in swimming

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that I've
practiced my entire life,

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.340 align:middle line:90%
and it's incredibly powerful.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, time is a
social construct, right?

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Time is not a universal fact.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you
deeply invest yourself

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:84%
in visualization practices,
to immerse yourself

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:84%
in the experience of what it's
like to participate in whatever

00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.050 align:middle line:84%
it is you're seeking to
participate in or succeed at,

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:84%
what happens is, you step into
this knowingness, the sense

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:90%
that it has already occurred.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:84%
That the work is done and
your job is just to show up.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that allows
you to then show up

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
without the anxiety and
the stress and the worry,

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and anchor yourself
in the present.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So visualization really for me
is a pathway into mindfulness

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and presence, the ability to
be truly in the moment of what

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.450 align:middle line:84%
you're doing without the
idle chatter of the thinking

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:37.940 align:middle line:84%
mind that's talking you out
of whatever it is that you're

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.090 align:middle line:90%
trying to accomplish.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.460 align:middle line:90%
So visualization is key.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.280 align:middle line:84%
But I think in order
for the visualization

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
to really take root and have
the impact that you're seeking,

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to be an active,
consistent meditator.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is
absolutely crucial.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.680 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to gain the
upper hand and the control

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.470 align:middle line:84%
over that thinking brain
and that idle chatter,

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and allows you to
be fully immersed

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:90%
in that present moment.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.100 align:middle line:90%
And as an athlete, that's key.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't enter that flow
state that you hear about

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.280 align:middle line:90%
if you're entertaining thought.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to be fully present
in what you're doing.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when you
are consistently meditating

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.540 align:middle line:90%
is that you develop this acumen.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like push-ups
for the brain.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And you then are the
master of the brain

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:90%
rather than being its slave.

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
absolutely crucial.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.292 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other
practices that have

00:27:34.292 --> 00:27:36.350 align:middle line:84%
been integral and
really important for me

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:90%
have been journaling.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of The Artist's
Way, which is a program created

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:90%
by Julia Cameron.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:90%
There's an amazing book.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about practices to
help you connect with yourself

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and tap into your
creative voice.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But one of the key tools in
that program is something

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:84%
called Morning Pages,
which is essentially

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:84%
journaling in the
morning every day,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.300 align:middle line:84%
free form, without
editing anything,

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.440 align:middle line:84%
to just kind of get out of
yourself and onto the page

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
whatever is happening in your
conscious and unconscious mind.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found
through many, many years

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:13.970 align:middle line:90%
of doing this--

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing it ever
since I got sober--

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is that it really helps you
crystallize your thoughts

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and it helps you get
very clear on what

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
it is that you are trying to
do so that you can organize

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.830 align:middle line:84%
your energy and your
time and your resources

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:84%
around the accomplishment of
that which is most key, most

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.745 align:middle line:90%
important to you.

00:28:36.745 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you didn't miss
that point, then, did you?

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:39.670 align:middle line:90%
You got it.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.177 align:middle line:84%
Back in late 2008, 2009,
after "Food Matters" had just

00:28:46.177 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:84%
come out, coincidentally, I was
in the States traveling a bit.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go to these
festivals and people

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.510 align:middle line:84%
would be like, oh my
god, how raw are you?

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:54.650 align:middle line:90%
How vegan are you?

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Like this and that,
and everyone was

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:84%
sort of judging each other
about their status of veganism

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:90%
or their status of raw foodism.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think still we've got
this legacy of nutritional dogma

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:90%
associated with labeling diets.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
How do you, being someone who's
adopted a plant-based diet,

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
how do you practice
being a spiritual person

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and being nonjudgmental, or
not being a vegan police?

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of vegan
bashing that happens, too.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.390 align:middle line:84%
How do you personally
balance that.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.758 align:middle line:84%
and how do you
approach that yourself?

00:29:28.758 --> 00:29:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> With respect to my own
relationship with food,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.150 align:middle line:84%
or how I communicate
with other people?

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:32.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Both.

00:29:32.973 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a little bit
of both, but mostly

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:84%
how you communicate
to other people.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Labels are not our friends.

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And we are animals
that love our tribes,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and nobody likes to be on a
team more than a human being.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And we can get very caught
up in that, to our detriment,

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I think we can all agree that
healthy eating is something

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:00.603 align:middle line:90%
we're all interested in.

00:30:00.603 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:84%
If anybody's watching
this show, they're

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.760 align:middle line:90%
probably interested in that.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But my perspective
on it is to not get

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:11.630 align:middle line:84%
caught up in these, whether
it's vegan, plant-based, raw,

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.568 align:middle line:90%
high raw, low carb, high fat.

00:30:13.568 --> 00:30:15.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, all these
different labels,

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I think serve more to
divide us than unite us.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm very conscious
and conscientious when

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I communicate to try to
transcend the dogma associated

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:90%
with these various categories.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
what happens when

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
we silo ourselves is
that we set ourselves up

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
for failure,
because we're trying

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to adhere to some perfectionist
standard that none of us

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:84%
can possibly adhere to,
because we're human beings

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and we're fallible
by nature, right?

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody says, I'm
going to be totally raw

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.180 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to be this or
that, and then a couple of weeks

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.180 align:middle line:84%
in or a year in or a
month in, they slip up,

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.670 align:middle line:84%
people tend to flog
themselves for that

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:00.407 align:middle line:84%
and throw the baby
out with the bathwater

00:31:00.407 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:90%
and say, this is too hard.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't possibly do this.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else seems to have
it figured out, but I don't.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they give up
and they retreat back

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
to their unhealthy,
old eating habits.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's not helping anybody.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So what I think is we have
to do the best that we can.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.568 align:middle line:84%
None of us is living a
zero-impact lifestyle.

00:31:18.568 --> 00:31:21.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, if somebody is vegan,
somebody else will say, yeah,

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.610 align:middle line:84%
but if you're
eating vegan, do you

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.730 align:middle line:84%
realize how many rodents
and bugs are churned up

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:26.870 align:middle line:90%
when they plow the field?

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah,
I get it, right?

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:33.260 align:middle line:84%
We all have an impact that
we're trying to minimize here.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.180 align:middle line:84%
The point is we do
the best we can.

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.950 align:middle line:90%
It is an aspiration.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:90%
We're all aspiring to be better.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.110 align:middle line:84%
What is the next best
choice that I can make?

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And let's leave it at that.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of how I
communicate with other people,

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.390 align:middle line:84%
my perspective is I'm
always wanting to fan

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:52.280 align:middle line:90%
the flames of positive change.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:84%
If somebody makes one step
in the right direction,

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.218 align:middle line:84%
I think it's worth celebrating
rather than chastising them

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:01.760 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
doing it perfect,

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.600 align:middle line:84%
or they overlook
this other thing.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's on their
own journey, right?

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.623 align:middle line:84%
And if you discourage somebody
by telling them, well, yeah,

00:32:08.623 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:84%
you kind of did
that, but you also

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't do this, who's
gaining by that?

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Only an insecure person will
try to take someone down a peg

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't do it as
well as some idealized version.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So my perspective
is always to fan

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.290 align:middle line:84%
the flames of positive
change, no matter

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:84%
how small or incremental
those steps are.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:84%
That is how we make
our way forward,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:84%
by celebrating everyone
else who's out there who's

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to do a little bit better
today than they did yesterday.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about these
extraordinary feats

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that you hit after
this 40 years of age.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Went plant-based at age 40.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:53.990 align:middle line:84%
At age 42, I did
my first Ultraman

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.270 align:middle line:90%
and I placed 11th overall.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.870 align:middle line:84%
2009, did my second Ultraman,
placed sixth overall.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:04.250 align:middle line:84%
2010, I did EPIC5, five Ironmans
on five Hawaiian islands in six

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:90%
and a half days, at age 43.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:84%
This past year, I competed
in the OTILLO Swimrun World

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Championships in Sweden, which
is a 10-hour ultra distance

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:84%
swimrun competition
where you traipse across,

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.140 align:middle line:84%
like, 50 islands spread
wide across the Stockholm

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.502 align:middle line:84%
archipelago, and you
do it as a team of two.

00:33:27.502 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:90%
I did it with my coach.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.430 align:middle line:90%
We were the fastest Americans.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
what place we got.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Took us like 10 hours.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.240 align:middle line:90%
I did that at age 50.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.280 align:middle line:90%
So I'm still getting after it.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.060 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, my first book
came out, "Finding Ultra."

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.740 align:middle line:84%
It's my memoir that
kind of tells my story.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And that has gone on to
sell quite a few copies.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I've got a brand
new version of that

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.310 align:middle line:90%
that's coming out this March.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.760 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I wrote two
cookbooks in the wake of that,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
"The Plant Power Way" and
"The Plant Power Way Italia,"

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:90%
which is coming out in April.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And in 2012 I launched
"The Ritual" podcast,

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.720 align:middle line:84%
which now has over
30 million downloads

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and reaches people
all over the world.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.469 align:middle line:84%
They're longform
conversations with all kinds

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:13.159 align:middle line:84%
of inspiring people across all
aspects of health, wellness,

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.139 align:middle line:84%
fitness, entrepreneurship
and the like.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a crazy,
wild ride, and it all

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:84%
started with changing my
relationship with food.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Just like you.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.259 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:34:23.259 --> 00:34:23.750 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't have been better.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.612 align:middle line:84%
So where I want to
finish with here

00:34:26.612 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
interesting for you,

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.770 align:middle line:84%
and I think you've touched
on it a little bit,

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:35.420 align:middle line:84%
is around how to create a sort
of-- in this process you've

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.300 align:middle line:84%
created for yourself a
greater sense of happiness

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and fulfillment and
contentment than you

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.889 align:middle line:90%
had when you were in your '30s.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.689 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that that's
what you initially set out

00:34:45.689 --> 00:34:46.489 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.639 align:middle line:84%
You initially set out to
just get out of this haze

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.199 align:middle line:90%
that you were in.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Reflecting on your
experience, what

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.970 align:middle line:84%
is your little formula
that you've garnered

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.310 align:middle line:90%
for happiness and fulfillment?

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Here are the five steps
to happiness and fulfillment,

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> How would you--

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:84%
do you think there's
something to it?

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you found a
passion, you found a calling

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:90%
and you went after it?

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:10.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:84%
How would you describe,
and how would you

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.390 align:middle line:84%
help, if you had
to lecture people

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.627 align:middle line:84%
about how to find
happiness and fulfillment,

00:35:16.627 --> 00:35:17.960 align:middle line:90%
what advice would you give them?

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So the best advice that I
can give to somebody who is

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:26.120 align:middle line:84%
searching for a greater purpose
and fulfillment in their life

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:90%
is to ask them one question.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that question
is, who are you?

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.560 align:middle line:90%
Like, who are you really?

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And resist the temptation to
provide just a flip answer.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:40.700 align:middle line:84%
This is my career,
this is what I do.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.270 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm talking about,
who are you really?

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.610 align:middle line:90%
What is unique about you?

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.830 align:middle line:84%
What is your specific,
unique blueprint and design?

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:55.800 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you are
here to express and create

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.600 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.560 align:middle line:84%
What is it about you that
makes you uniquely you?

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.140 align:middle line:84%
What gets you out of
bed in the morning,

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.390 align:middle line:90%
excited about your life?

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not suspecting
that everybody's

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.490 align:middle line:84%
going to have an answer
to that immediately,

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:84%
but I think exploration
of that inquiry

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:84%
is the path forward to
ultimately living a more

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:90%
purposeful, meaningful life.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can
identify that thing--

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and it could be as
silly as, you know,

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I like making
papier-mache birds,

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
or I want to tell
jokes on stage,

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:middle line:84%
or I want to learn how
to play the guitar,

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:84%
or I always wanted to
be an opera singer--

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.010 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be some
crazy, big, romantic thing.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:41.930 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was simple as, I just
love jumping into a swimming

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.280 align:middle line:90%
pool in the morning.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Or I love the feeling of
how the sun hits my shoulder

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:90%
on a trail run at dawn.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Those were things I wanted
to have more of in my life.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Very simple, basic, ultimately
quite primal instincts.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And my path has been to just
express that more in my life

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's led me to
all of these places.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have to be that
thing of, like, well, I'm just

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.150 align:middle line:90%
going to quit my job overnight.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think the more
you can invest yourself

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.950 align:middle line:84%
in that journey of
trying to identify

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:21.480 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you are here to
do, that is the path forward.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you commit
yourself fully to that,

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.630 align:middle line:84%
you will be amazed at
what transpires over time.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

Well answered, sir.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Very well done.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Final question here for you.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a big one.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:36.725 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure you're
ready for it.

00:37:36.725 --> 00:37:37.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.212 align:middle line:84%
So you're stepping
out onto a stage,

00:37:41.212 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and someone hands
you a microphone.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, look, the
whole world is listening.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.893 align:middle line:90%
You've got two minutes.

00:37:47.893 --> 00:37:49.435 align:middle line:84%
What lesson would
you teach humanity?

00:37:49.435 --> 00:37:50.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:37:50.862 --> 00:37:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, this is a big one.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've distilled
a lot of your knowledge

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.990 align:middle line:90%
into so many different things.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.820 align:middle line:84%
But what message would
you have for humanity?

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a big deal.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> My message to
humanity is twofold.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Take responsibility
for your own life,

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and give of yourself
freely to others.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:14.140 align:middle line:84%
If you can take control
of your own path

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and then devote
yourself in service

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:19.210 align:middle line:84%
to the betterment of
other human beings,

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:24.760 align:middle line:84%
you will find more fulfillment,
more purpose, more contentment,

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.120 align:middle line:84%
and more happiness than
you can possibly imagine.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And that will be your gift
to humanity and to the planet

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:33.970 align:middle line:90%
that we all share.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:90%
