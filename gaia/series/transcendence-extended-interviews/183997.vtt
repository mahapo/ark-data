00:00:02.994 --> 00:00:13.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So how I got into this field
was I started out as a computer

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.050 align:middle line:84%
engineer, moved
to Silicon Valley,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.490 align:middle line:90%
tried to start a company.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I realized that
my timing, in a word, sucked.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.197 align:middle line:84%
The dot.com bubble
exploded within months

00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:90%
of me getting there.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.208 align:middle line:84%
And I and 14,000 other people
were laid off in April of 2001.

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I was also trying
to start a company.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I lost all my money.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point, the only
job I could get in the Valley

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
was essentially a job that
was dialing for dollars.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I would have to call up law
firms and sell them technology

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:90%
to manage their firms.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And the economy was so
bad, companies were not

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:90%
even paying a base salary.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you did not close a
sale, you did not get paid.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that state of
desperation, of pure misery,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I remember getting online
on 2002's version of Google

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:90%
and searching for some hope.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't remember
what I put in.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was how
to succeed at work.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was why does
life suck so bad?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But what I discovered
was meditation.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So I flew to LA, took my
first meditation class.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back to
work, interesting things

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:90%
started happening.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Within one week, I
doubled my sales.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I continued diving more
into the application of this

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
what I now call transcendent
practices, which includes

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
things such as
positive statements,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
creative visualization,
mindfulness--

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.710 align:middle line:84%
as I started applying
this in my work,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I continued growing and
growing and growing.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Four months later, I had
been promoted three times,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
was made director of sales, and
asked to run the company's New

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:90%
York office.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:90%
And so I did that for 18 months.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided I wanted
to do more with my life.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, Nelson Mandela

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.620 align:middle line:84%
said, if you want to change
the world, change education.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And I asked myself,
why is it that all

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of these incredible
practices that I had learned,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
from mindfulness, to meditation,
to creative visualization,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:84%
why did I only learn
them in my 20s?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.889 align:middle line:84%
Why was this not
taught in schools?

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought,
well, look, if I'm

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
going to tackle education
to change the world,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:90%
I want to teach meditation.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
mindvalley started.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.036 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So the big mistake
that many people make

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't set
goals or define success

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
based on our own self
identity but based on what

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%
I call the culturescape.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:84%
The culturescape is that
tangled web of rituals, habits,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
beliefs, mythologies,
practices that our culture,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.340 align:middle line:84%
our religions, our
countries, through schooling,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
through education,
through media infuse us

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.223 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what is the right
way to function in the world.

00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, post-World War
II, the culturescape

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
was really about rebuilding,
about being safe.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But in today's
world, we are safe.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And so in today's world,
the millennial generation,

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:84%
the big thing that they want
to pursue is self-discovery,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:90%
is creation.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.570 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the culturescape
keeps engulfing us and telling

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:84%
us that we need
a college degree,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.312 align:middle line:84%
we need to get a good career,
we need to work the 9:00 to 5:00

00:03:12.312 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
we need to make sure our GPAs
are good enough so we can get

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
into graduate school so we can
get that law degree so we can

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
make partner in that
law firm so we can

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:84%
have 2.5 cars in a garage,
a wife, and two kids,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and then work from 9:00
to 5:00, slave for a wage

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
so we can save so that
someday when we are 60,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
we can finally retire
and see the world.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, those
rules don't apply anymore.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
The culturescape was
designed to keep us safe,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
but it was never designed
to keep us happy.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And so great
thinkers, people who

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
are leading extraordinary
lives, question.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
They question the
rules that were

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.460 align:middle line:90%
infused into them as children.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
True religion, true media, true
fathers, mothers, teachers,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.990 align:middle line:84%
preachers, they question, and
they create their own rules.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Hunter S. Thompson, the
American writer, in 1953,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:84%
was asked to write a
letter to a friend.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:84%
His friend was
asking for advice.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.692 align:middle line:84%
And I remember something really
beautiful in that letter that

00:04:06.692 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:90%
has now become legendary.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Hunter says the big
danger with goal-setting

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
is that we aren't
setting our own goals,

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
we're setting goals that
society said we should set.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:84%
And so what he suggests is that
we do not conform ourselves

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to society's state of goals, the
culturescape's state of goals.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we make those
goals conform to us,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
to what our soul
wants to discover,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
to what we want to
experience on Planet Earth.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The danger with goal-setting
is very often the goals

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:90%
that you set are not your goals.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
They are the
culturescape's definition

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.055 align:middle line:84%
of how you are meant to
be safe in the world.

00:04:45.055 --> 00:04:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But that is one of the
surest paths the misery,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to waking up one day at
the age of 40 going, what

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:90%
the hell happened to my life?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we always
have to question.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.962 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:56.962 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So here's why I believe
happiness is so important.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Our culturescape has taught
us an if-then version

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:90%
of happiness.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
If I get this job,
then I will be happy.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
If I get this girl,
then I will be happy.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
problem with that.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that is
that happiness, you see,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
is not a byproduct
of getting something.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is a state of being.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And happiness is not what you
get from achieving your goal.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is rocket
fuel towards your goal.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the latest study
coming in from psychologists

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
like Shawn Achor, who wrote
the book "Happiness Advantage,"

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:84%
happiness moves you
towards your goals.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Happiness increases
your productivity.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Doctors who are
primed to be happy

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
are 19% better at
performing diagnoses.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Salespeople who
are more optimistic

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.035 align:middle line:84%
are 50% better than
pessimistic salespeople.

00:05:49.035 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Students do better
on their tests

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.785 align:middle line:84%
when they are
primed to be happy.

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
You see, happiness is not
the result of getting a goal.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is rocket
fuel towards your goal.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.490 align:middle line:84%
So the trick, the real
trick to success in life

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:90%
is not to not set goals.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
It's to have these goals, but
to untangle your happiness

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:84%
from these goals, to be
happy before you attain them,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to use that happiness as a
fuel so that, day to day,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
as you are pursuing these
goals, which can get tricky,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
which can get challenging, that
happiness is like your ally.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:90%
It moves you along.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
That helps dampen the downsides
of occasional obstacles

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:84%
or failure that
carries you forward,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that puts you in an
optimistic level of mind

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
so you attract the
right people, you

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
can work with the right
people to pursue your goal.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So the last time I
checked, which was 2015,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
there were 1,400
different studies

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
on the power of
meditation, everything

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
from helping reduce the
onset of heart disease,

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
to helping improve your skin,
to improving productivity,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to improving
compassion and empathy.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is one
of those powerful tools

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that any human being can
bring in their life to improve

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:90%
their functioning in the world.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
The thing is we don't
know why meditation works.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has yet figured
out the exact reasons

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.715 align:middle line:84%
why meditation causes
all of these feelings.

00:07:16.715 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
There are theories, but no
one has really boiled it down.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But just because we
don't know why it works

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean we can't use it.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for the longest
time, human beings

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:90%
had no idea what the sun was.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Ancient cultures thought it
was a god or a giant fireball.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:84%
But we could still use
the sun for agriculture,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
for navigation, for warmth,
for direction, for heat.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, we don't know
why meditation works.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But 1,400 studies have now shown
that meditation pretty much

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
enhances so many multiple
dimensions of human living

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.652 align:middle line:84%
that every single
human being should

00:07:51.652 --> 00:07:53.485 align:middle line:84%
be making this part of
their daily practice.

00:07:53.485 --> 00:07:55.668 align:middle line:90%

00:07:55.668 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:84%
When we are children, we
have this thing in our head

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:84%
that I call the
meaning-making machine.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
We are little, tiny humans
trying to figure out the world.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And a meaning-making
machine tries

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to grant meaning to everything
that happens in our lives.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Our mom or our dad yell at
us or send us to a corner.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And we may not necessarily
get the meaning

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that they are trying
to install on us.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
They may simply be trying
to make us more disciplined.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.130 align:middle line:90%
We may take on our own meanings.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Mom wants me in a corner because
I'm not important to her.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.299 align:middle line:84%
Dad asks me to be quiet
because he doesn't

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.250 align:middle line:84%
want to hear what I
have to say because what

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I say isn't important.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Mom doesn't want
to talk to me today

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:90%
because she doesn't love me.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
See, kids don't
have adult brains.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:90%
They are children.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.890 align:middle line:84%
But this meaning-making
machine creates these meanings

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:84%
that stick with them,
infuse into them,

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and stay with them
into adulthood.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And so all of us
go into adulthood

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
with bad meanings
around the world.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most
common meanings, according

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
to psychologists and therapists
like Marisa Peer or Shelly

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Lefkoe are the ideas that
I am not good enough.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I am not important.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I am not loved.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:84%
What I have to say
is not important.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And these things
hold us back in life.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So much of what we do
as adults is really

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
to try to patch
these holes which

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
we have been carrying with
us for the longest times.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't
think we are lovable,

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
we try to seek love
from other people.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
We become needy in relationships
or become desperate

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
for attention or
love, not realizing

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that everything we need in terms
of love can come from within.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And all of that
could have emerged

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
from a tiny incident
in childhood

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:84%
where you felt that your
father or mother said or did

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
something that made you believe
that maybe they didn't love you

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:90%
as much as you thought.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And so all human beings
grow up in a world

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:84%
where, sadly, they've had
holes infused in them.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And the journey
to personal growth

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:84%
is really being able
to go from having

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:90%
these holes to becoming whole.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
so important for us

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that we are looking
within to identify what beliefs

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.660 align:middle line:84%
we have about ourselves
and our world,

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and being able to ask
ourselves, is this really true.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And as parents,
when we are dealing

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:84%
with kids, the single
most important thing

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.663 align:middle line:84%
to ask yourself in any
interaction with your child,

00:10:32.663 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
according to psychologist
Shelly Lefkoe,

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
is what meaning is my child
going to take away from this?

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.458 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:46.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I think fear is a
really natural, normal,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:84%
human instinct fear is what
kept us safe for so long.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.622 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we did not have
fear, probably the human species

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
would not be where it
is today because we

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:84%
would have all killed
ourselves trying

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:90%
to get too close to tigers.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.140 align:middle line:90%
But here's something to realize.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
In today's world, we
are primarily safe.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And I remember reading a
really interesting story

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.950 align:middle line:90%
about Elon Musk.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.762 align:middle line:84%
So Elon Musk, as you
know, is probably

00:11:13.762 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
one of the most prominent
entrepreneurs on the planet

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to get
mankind to Mars.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.610 align:middle line:84%
He's trying to move humanity
to an alternative energy

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:90%
system with his Tesla cars.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And in an interview with Neil
deGrasse Tyson on a podcast,

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Neil deGrasse Tyson
asked Elon Musk,

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
how is he so
confident, so fearless.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And Elon spoke about how once,
when he was a college kid,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:90%
he tried an experiment.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.890 align:middle line:84%
He tried to see if he
could live on $1 a day.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And living in America,
well, you can go to Walmart

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and buy really crappy yet enough
food to survive for $1 a day.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Elon was able to pull this off.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.660 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to live
on $1 a day for 30 days.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said when he
figured that was possible,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.450 align:middle line:84%
all fear disappeared because
look, you can't get a job,

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:90%
no problem.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:90%
You're going to survive.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:84%
When your basic need for
survival, which, 300 years ago,

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
we couldn't guarantee to kids
and adults, but today, we can--

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
when the basic need for survival
is pretty much guaranteed,

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:90%
your fear is able to dissolve.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And so people who
are fearless often

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:84%
have come to realize that
the basic need for survival

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:90%
is taken care of.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.027 align:middle line:90%
Now, what can you do?

00:12:26.027 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, once your basic
need for survival

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
is taken care of, what
helps mitigate fear and move

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
fear away is often
living on purpose.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:40.420 align:middle line:84%
You see, people who live on
purpose understand this rule,

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that there is no good
or no bad that happens

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:90%
to you in the world.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is good.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is bad.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything is just so.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
The only question you
want to ask yourself

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.840 align:middle line:84%
is, am I aligned
with my purpose?

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Is what I'm doing
true to my purpose?

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is we
are not omnisentient.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if any
action we are taking

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.490 align:middle line:90%
is always the right action.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
we take it anyway,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
trusting that if it isn't
the right action, it's fine.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It will teach us, or
through that failure,

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
we will learn something
that lets us correct,

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and correct again,
and correct again.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So if this is your goal and
this is where you are right now,

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.020 align:middle line:84%
people who are living
on purpose are not

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.180 align:middle line:84%
looking to get there
in a straight line.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:84%
They know that they
may make a wrong bet.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
They may start a
company, and it may fail.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
They may marry someone, and
that may end in divorce.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:84%
But each of these are simply
micro corrections where

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:90%
they are learning something.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And these corrections
still eventually get them

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:90%
to the goal.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.893 align:middle line:84%
Now, Michael Beckwith
thought me a model

00:13:41.893 --> 00:13:43.060 align:middle line:90%
which is really interesting.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
It's called kensho
versus satori.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:84%
When you're living life, moving
towards a particular purpose,

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
there are two very important
things to understand.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Life helps us grow,
and correct, and evolve

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
through kensho, which
is growth by pain,

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
or satori, which is
growth by insight.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
Every now and then, you
will have a satori moment,

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.440 align:middle line:84%
a sudden awakening, a eureka
moment, an insight that

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.060 align:middle line:90%
helps you move forward.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, that isn't
really going to be as easy.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Most of us grow through kensho.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Kensho is growth from pain.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
You fall sick and
end up hospitalized,

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.890 align:middle line:84%
but you emerge with new-found
respect for your body

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and making new
choices in how you're

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:90%
going to treat your health.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:84%
You start a business,
and it fails.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's painful.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But that's kensho
because now you

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:84%
know what not to do
in your next business.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
A relationship dissolves, and
you experience heartbreak.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But that's kensho
because now you

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
know the man or woman you
need to evolve to create

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:90%
even better relationships.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you see life as satori
moments, sudden awakenings,

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and kensho, growth
through pain, fear

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:84%
dissolves because you know that
even when something bad happens

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:84%
to you, it's simply a
friendly universe giving you

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
a lesson or fine tuning
and tweaking your direction

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
so you can get to your
purpose even faster.

00:15:13.457 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
different ideas and models

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:90%
to help you find your purpose.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the best
models I've learned

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.040 align:middle line:84%
comes from a writer called
Amir Ahmad Nasr, who is

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:90%
a Sudanese refugee in Canada.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And I was talking to Amir.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me how often
the pain that we go through

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
during our childhood,
during our growth periods

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
is really a sign of what
our greater purpose is.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So think back to a time
when you were growing up.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:84%
What was it that
really frustrated you?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.930 align:middle line:84%
What angered you
about the world?

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you
what it was for me.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the
country of Malaysia.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up in a Hindu
family in a Muslim country.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going to school,
a public government school,

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.547 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the amount of
racism that I encountered.

00:16:02.547 --> 00:16:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I looked different
from the other kids

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:84%
because I was a small minority
in terms of my ethnicity.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I remember being bullied,
being called names

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:90%
because I looked different.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I remember a scene from class
when I was nine years old,

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.630 align:middle line:84%
when a teacher was teaching
the entire classroom how

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.918 align:middle line:84%
we should not trust Americans
because they are bad people.

00:16:24.918 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember growing up
on American television,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
thinking to myself,
that's absolute rubbish,

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:90%
as a nine-year-old.

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I experienced racism.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I was indoctrinated with ideas
of distrusting other cultures.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And so when I grew up and I
actually moved to America,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:84%
I understood just
what diversity meant.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I understood how much
brainwashing kids in my country

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:84%
were going through
in the '70s and '80s.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to dedicate
my life to take that anger

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and fuel it into doing
something constructive.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
So I joined a
non-profit organization

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:84%
called ISAC, which takes
students from around the world,

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
exchanges them across
countries to create

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.300 align:middle line:90%
cross-cultural understanding.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:84%
That pain as a child
helped me discover a value.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And that value is
world-centrism.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, that value helped me
discover my purpose, which

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
is starting companies and
businesses that help connect

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.440 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And so after my
non-profit days, when

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I started my next company,
which was mindvalley,

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I made sure to create a
company that was truly diverse.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Today, in our office,
we employ people

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:84%
from 40 different countries,
40 different nationalities

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and passport holders
in one office.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But that would not
be so, I would not

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:84%
be doing work to unify cultures
to build a global business

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:84%
whose number one
value is connectedness

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:84%
if I did not go through all
of that pain in childhood

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.720 align:middle line:84%
in a schooling system
that was filled

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:90%
with racism and prejudice.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So think back of that pain that
you went through as a child.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
that was for you.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But in that pain are the
clues to what your purpose is.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.268 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:09.268 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a big
difference between goals,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:90%
happiness, and fulfillment.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Our culture gets this wrong.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:90%
We are told that you need goals.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you attain these
goals, you become happy.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
None of that really matters.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It turns out what we truly
want is not happiness.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:90%
What we want is fulfillment.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:90%
And there is a difference.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Fulfillment is beyond happiness.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Fulfillment is being able
to look back and go, wow,

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I led a really
extraordinary life.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are three things,
three types of pursuits

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:90%
that bring us fulfillment.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really looking at
this from the point of view

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are souls here in a meat
body on a giant rock hurtling

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
through space having
a human experience.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.080 align:middle line:90%
So the three things are this.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:90%
The first is human experiences.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And experiences are
not necessarily things

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:90%
that money can buy.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
An experience could be a kiss
with someone you really love.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It could be holding a child,
your child, in your arms.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be an extreme sport,
or eating of food that you so

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:90%
enjoy, or laughing with friends.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.323 align:middle line:84%
You do not need money for
many of these experiences.

00:19:23.323 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
question you want

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to ask yourself is not what
goals do I want in life,

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:84%
because goals may
not necessarily lead

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.108 align:middle line:90%
to happiness or fulfillment.

00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:84%
The first question you
want to ask yourself

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:90%
is, what experiences do I want?

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:90%
But there's a second question.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that causes
our souls to get fulfilled

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.980 align:middle line:90%
is growth.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I believe that one of
the reasons we are here

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.602 align:middle line:90%
is to grow and evolve.

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So the second question
you want to ask yourself

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.518 align:middle line:90%
is, how am I going to grow?

00:19:50.518 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
want to actually make

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:84%
a list of all the
opportunities and ways you

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:90%
want to grow as a human being.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
It could be learning
a new language.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:84%
It could be learning
a new skill.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.408 align:middle line:84%
It could be learning
public speaking,

00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:90%
learning to be a better parent.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It could be learning
mindfulness, or meditation,

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:84%
or creative visualization,
or harnessing your intuition.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:84%
But we gain fulfillment
from growth.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:90%
But there is a third question.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:84%
That third question is, look,
if I was a human being who

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.960 align:middle line:84%
had all of these
beautiful experiences, who

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:84%
has grown in all of
these amazing ways,

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
how can I give
back to the world?

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And giving back or
contribution is the third step

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
to fulfillment.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama once said,
you want to be happy?

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Make other people happy.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Contribution is where you make
a list of all the ways you

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:84%
can contribute to pushing
humanity forward, whether it's

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:84%
charitable giving, or
raising spectacular kids,

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.465 align:middle line:84%
or volunteering, or
starting a company,

00:20:42.465 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
or building something
that can actually

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:90%
make an impact in the world.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Contribution is that third step.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So really, the path
to fulfillment,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself the three
most important questions.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
What experiences
do I want in life?

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:90%
How do I want to grow?

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:90%
And how do I want to contribute?

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
That is the new
form of goal-setting

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:84%
that I think really leads to
spectacular, extraordinary,

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:90%
fulfilled lives.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So in my book, "The Code
of the Extraordinary Mind,"

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.533 align:middle line:84%
I share an idea that I
call the Godicle theory.

00:21:18.533 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Godicle theory
is really my worldview.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
The Godicle theory
suggests that we

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
are all particles of a
larger collective whole,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:90%
particles of God, or Godicles.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, I view the world this way.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.890 align:middle line:84%
But something interesting
happens when you take on this

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
view that humanity, all of
us-- you and me and every other

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:90%
human being on Earth--

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
are simply cells of a
larger entity, an entity

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:90%
that perhaps we call God.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
You see, if we are cells of
a larger entity, if we are.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Godicles, then one of the
first things that comes to mind

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is that we're all
in this together,

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that every single
Godicle, or human being,

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
is here for a
particular reason, just

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.270 align:middle line:84%
like every cell in your
body has its own purpose,

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.480 align:middle line:84%
its own meaning, its
own reason for being.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, every cell in your
body works in synchronicity

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
to help your body thrive, to
help every other cell thrive.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
The cells of the heart, if they
were to suddenly stop working,

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:84%
every other cell in your
body eventually dies.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe life
is like that as well.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Michael Beckwith said
there are no extra people

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:90%
on Planet Earth.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
If you are born, if you have
a pulse, you have a purpose.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that purpose
is to help our world.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And our world needs
every other cell

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that composes our
world, this giant body,

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.112 align:middle line:90%
evolve, grow, and progress.

00:22:39.112 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think
about the world this way,

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
in every decision,

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
we can make a decision that's
going to push humanity forward,

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
or we can make a decision that's
going to hold humanity back.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:84%
In every company, you can
be a humanity-plus company,

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:84%
a company that is
actually contributing

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:84%
to humanity's progress
through the ages

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
or a humanity-minus
company, a company that's

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.130 align:middle line:90%
holding people back.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
In work, in life, you always
want to be humanity-plus.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And as a side
benefit, studies have

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
found that when
you are doing work

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:84%
that seems to have a mission,
a purpose, and that purpose

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and mission is always for the
greater good of the world,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
it leads to your own
internal fulfillment.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we are cells
in a larger being.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the entire point of
life is to really, like a cell,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:90%
do good for the larger whole.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we get rewarded
with that little happy juice

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:90%
that we call fulfillment.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I ask people that
when they start companies,

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:84%
or when they work, or
when they join a company,

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
they work on projects that
are pushing humanity forward.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.752 align:middle line:90%

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.250 align:middle line:90%
The answer is I don't know.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're talking
about extraordinary

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in terms of these
exceptional feats,

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
maybe they had a certain
biological mutation or quirk

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:90%
in their DNA, like Wim Hof.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, his body was studied.

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And there were certain things,
certain genetics that he had

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.888 align:middle line:90%
that gave him that advantage.

00:24:09.888 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, what
really is extraordinary?

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So diving with sharks
is extraordinary.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But that mother who gave
birth to three kids,

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:84%
sacrificed her career so
she could stay at home

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and raise three
amazing children,

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:84%
isn't that equally
extraordinary in some degree?

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So who actually gets to
define extraordinary?

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I think extraordinary
is one thing.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Extraordinary is when
you are living life

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:84%
on your own terms, what Jeffrey
Allen calls sovereignty.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
You are living life based not
on the rules of the culturescape

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:84%
but based on your own
rules, your own rules

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:90%
that lead to your fulfillment.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And you are doing
things that are not just

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.810 align:middle line:84%
keeping you fulfilled but are
pushing forward the human race.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:90%
So you could be a mom.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Or you could be a schoolteacher.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Or you could be a park ranger.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And your only job is to
basically plant and take

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.000 align:middle line:84%
care of trees, but you're
doing it on your terms

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.800 align:middle line:90%
because that brings you joy.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It makes you fulfilled.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:90%
It's elevating the human race.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.278 align:middle line:84%
And you got there because
you want to be there.

00:25:11.278 --> 00:25:12.195 align:middle line:90%
That is extraordinary.

00:25:12.195 --> 00:25:14.945 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:14.945 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.525 align:middle line:84%
So as we go through
life, the purpose

00:25:22.525 --> 00:25:25.150 align:middle line:84%
of the culturescape, the purpose
of the rules, and the rituals,

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and the religions,
and the cultures

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:90%
is simply to keep us safe.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.840 align:middle line:84%
It's because human beings
are born in such a complex,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:90%
multidimensional world.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And so to help ease
us along the path

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:84%
so we can make better
decisions, we emulate.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.973 align:middle line:84%
We take on, through
social conditioning,

00:25:41.973 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
patterns of past generations
so that we can function

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.940 align:middle line:90%
in this highly complex world.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem is some of these
patterns are good, right?

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Learning that eating
vegetables is healthy is good.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
But some of these patents,
or these rules, are bad.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I call these brules,
or bullshit rules.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Bullshit rules are rules that
evolve in the culturescape

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to keep us safe and that we
blindly follow because we

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.860 align:middle line:90%
think we need to stay safe.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Bullshit rules are
rules such as we

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.530 align:middle line:84%
must worship a particular
deity in a particular way,

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
or that woman must dress
in a particular way

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:84%
to not offend men, or that men
must prove their self-worth

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:90%
in a particular masculine way.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
There are whole
collections of brules

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
that emerged from our
cultures, from our religions,

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:84%
from our politicians,
from our media.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And these brules keep
so many people stifled.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So you want to ask yourself, is
what you are following a brule?

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Or is it an actual
beneficial rule

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
that helps you live
life on your terms?

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, I think the most
important thing is sovereignty.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that you are
setting your own rules.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:84%
You're creating
your own boundaries.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:84%
You can listen to what
the culturescape, what

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:84%
the mythologies, the religions,
the media, the education

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
systems of the
world tell you you

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.750 align:middle line:90%
need to do to live a good life.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:13.380 align:middle line:84%
But you make your own decisions
based on what makes you happy.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think when
you can do that, you

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:84%
will start to move along
the path of your mission

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:90%
and your purpose much faster.
