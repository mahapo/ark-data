00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Since childhood, I've
been very attracted to water.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with a swimming
pool in the backyard

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and we had a family
boat, so it was always

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:84%
about exploring the
ocean, basically.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And my parents
wanted me to be safe,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.780 align:middle line:84%
so even from a stage of being
a baby, I learned swimming,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
both with my mother,
but also professionally.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And that led into
competitive swimming

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:90%
and freediving eventually.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's been always something
that that's been like a hobby

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.584 align:middle line:84%
and then turned
into a profession.

00:00:47.584 --> 00:00:50.888 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:54.528 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:84%
I think what happened
to me-- in freediving

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
was going from
competitive free diving

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and becoming a full-time
freediving world champion,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I realized that you didn't
have a big impact, really,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:90%
because it's a very small sport.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful sport
and it's a great journey,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:90%
but it's still very limited.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to reach
a greater audience,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and when I passed the 20-minute
limit breath hold-- so in 2010,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I was the first person on
this planet to surpass that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:90%
barrier--

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I held my breath for
20 minutes, 10 seconds

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
because I like to show that
dedication and perfectionism.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So on April 1, to
make it a bit funny,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I held my breath in a shark
tank for 20 minutes, 10 seconds.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And that showed me a new
way of using my sport

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:90%
to helping more people.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I went on to do the
22-minutes Guinness World

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Record, the current official
Guinness World Record.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
I also did 250 feet
under ice in Speedos,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and that also seemed to start
almost a new trend in health

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and Viking swimming,
we call it--

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.600 align:middle line:84%
so go and swim when
it's cold, in ice water,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:84%
like they do in
Russia and Finland.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
new movement now,

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:84%
understanding all the benefits
and the energy-raising benefits

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:90%
from swimming under ice.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.395 align:middle line:84%
Also did 500 feet
with a monofin,

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and those were all official
Guinness World Records,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.312 align:middle line:84%
and it was on a show
for Discovery Channel.

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So that reached a big
audience, and in that, I

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
reached my goal of getting the
message out that breathing,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.722 align:middle line:84%
breathwork, and linking
that with your mind really

00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
can have a tremendous impact
on both your performance

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.990 align:middle line:90%
but also your daily health.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the reasons
for doing the "Speedo dive,"

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] as we call it--
it's been nicknamed swimming

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
basically naked under
ice in Greenland--

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:84%
was to reach, for me,
the epitome of my career

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and freediving
and use everything

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I've learned to put it
into a kind of masterpiece.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
chose Greenland.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We had incredible support
from the local community,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
from the people behind
the scenes shooting this,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and it was truly like swimming
on a different planet.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Like when you see movies and
the best Hollywood productions,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:90%
this was like being there live.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So even though I swim
with my eyes closed

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very focused--

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a different
mental state--

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
we still had the
training dives and I also

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
peek sometimes to
know where I am

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:90%
so I'm not getting off course.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
But that experience of being
in this pristine environment,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:90%
its crushing beauty--

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.433 align:middle line:84%
and Greenland is truly stunning
because you feel so small,

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
so it also puts
you in your place.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:90%
You know, you're a nobody.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
You're just doing some
Guinness World Records.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.680 align:middle line:90%
It's like-- really.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.760 align:middle line:90%
It's all about nature.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And this deep connection
I think, also,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:90%
is what connected with people.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it's true that it's
difficult for many people

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:90%
What is this freediving?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of crazy,
holding your breath.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And some people go on a machine.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.955 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they dive just
a long distance in a pool.

00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
There's also something
extremely boring

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:84%
called static-- the one where I
hold my breath for 22 minutes.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Really boring.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lot of
stuff going on, of course,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:84%
mentally and
spiritually behind that.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard for people to
connect to this experience.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:84%
But when you see
somebody dive under ice,

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
there will be some reaction,
like oh, that's cold,

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
or that's amazing, or
wow, that's beautiful.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.210 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen images
from under the ice.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
record brought a lot

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
of extra dimensions
of beauty and nature

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.253 align:middle line:90%
into people's living rooms.

00:04:32.253 --> 00:04:35.564 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:35.564 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.850 align:middle line:84%
The cold is always a
challenge because you will

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:90%
die if you're not prepared.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Doctors always talk about
brain freeze or stroke.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So your heart can
basically stop if there

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
is too big of a shock for the
difference in temperature.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:90%
But I had prepared well.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I had done this Guinness
World Record before.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I actually was the
record holder already.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So it was not about
setting a new record.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It was more about
making the perfect dive.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So it was a beautiful
dive and elegant,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and it was actually to show
the serenity of nature.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And we couldn't find a
better place than Greenland

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to do this-- swimming
under the ice.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.612 align:middle line:90%
But it's also about luck.

00:05:19.612 --> 00:05:20.412 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:05:20.412 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
We did not know the
conditions because I

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
was the first human being
ever to dive in that lake.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
That experience alone-- being
the first human being on this

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:84%
planet with, soon I
think, 8 billion people--

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to be the first to
touch that water,

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.697 align:middle line:84%
it was like the
holy grail for me.

00:05:35.697 --> 00:05:39.176 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
The 22-minute dive was
really a wonderful dive.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It was a tough dive, pushing
me to my absolute limit.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
But I had trained for the
dive, and I really, really

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:90%
wanted it to be successful.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.337 align:middle line:84%
You breathe oxygen before,
just so people get the picture,

00:06:02.337 --> 00:06:03.962 align:middle line:84%
but you still have
to hold your breath.

00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
So the most difficult thing
about holding your breath

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.250 align:middle line:84%
is not lacking oxygen.
Well, then at one point,

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.358 align:middle line:90%
you'll become unconscious.

00:06:10.358 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So you have to know how
to change your metabolism

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%
and change your
brain wave activity

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and become like in
meditative state.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But the most difficult thing is
to fight the urge to breathe.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So the level of
carbon dioxide, CO2,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
keeps rising, rising, rising
because you don't exhale.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So you have nowhere to
put, or store, that CO2.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So your body becomes
extremely acidic.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
pH drops like [BRGGG],,
like skydiver.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's just very
uncomfortable.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're just lying
there, not moving,

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's like you're
running full-out sprint.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And your legs are burning.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just going
crazy in your body.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense,
yes, it looks easy,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
you're not moving.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:90%
But inside, your body--

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.272 align:middle line:90%
it's like a volcano.

00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
There is so much
activity going on,

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:90%
and you have to control that.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
that dive-- also,

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I did 22.00 to
show a dedication.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like some
minute here or there.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like on the mark that
I had set up to reach.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it also started
maybe a new era in freediving,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that there
are many ways to freedive.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways to
demonstrate human skills

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
and human limitations.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And when doctors say, oh,
you'll have brain damage,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:84%
so you'll die after a few
minutes-- there are so

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
many things in the
conservative way of looking

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
at medical, anatomical,
physiological, neurological

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
facts that it really doesn't
add up to what we know today

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.945 align:middle line:84%
when we combine it to the
ancient timeless wisdom.

00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
my biggest missions,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.460 align:middle line:90%
is to bridge that gap.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I come from a
background of biology.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I have a master's degree in
biology-- marine biologist--

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:90%
and I have a PhD in medicine.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So I know a bit of this world,
but I found it very limiting--

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:90%
so limiting-- beliefs.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And a big part of my "job"
is to break those limits--

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
for myself, for humanity,
but also for science--

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:90%
to open up for new discoveries.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you put
a number right there,

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:90%
you can't run away from that.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
No scientist will say
that didn't happen.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.850 align:middle line:90%
The proof is in the pudding.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think once those
records become more accepted,

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:84%
then the idea of
changing the mindset

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and reaching things we
never thought were possible

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.544 align:middle line:90%
also becomes more acceptable.

00:08:36.544 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's
what it's all about.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.586 align:middle line:84%
When you want to
break limits, you

00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
want to change the
mindset of people.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Scientists or athletes
or everyday people--

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
you want to change
their mindset to achieve

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
greater results in life.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And with this dive,
the 22 minutes,

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:84%
I had my brother
there-- right there.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:90%
He's a doctor.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:90%
He's taken care of me.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Never freedive alone in water.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But also to be
there with someone

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:84%
who loves you and supports
you and have that experience

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:90%
is also very rewarding to me.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.122 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the number,
because a number is just--

00:09:13.122 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
somebody will beat
the record eventually.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not a big deal.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just a number.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.830 align:middle line:84%
It's more the experience
in itself that's wonderful.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And it opens this
dialogue with science.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Next week, I'm speaking at
the American Association

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:27.673 align:middle line:90%
for Respiratory Care.

00:09:27.673 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm a keynote speaker there.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually giving a keynote
that they get credit for--

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:90%
continuous educational credit.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So this would
never have happened

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
had I not done this 22-minute
Guinness World Record.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, it's
"proof" that it does matter,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and when you put yourself on
the line and make these records

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:84%
it actually opens the world for
new, amazing things to happen,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and then, again,
reflects back, hopefully,

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:84%
on everyday people-- health,
nutrition, life, mindset,

00:09:54.790 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and ways to treat patients
and illness from a little bit

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.534 align:middle line:90%
different perspective.

00:10:03.534 --> 00:10:06.366 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.770 align:middle line:84%
The experience with
the killer whales

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:84%
was completely
out of this world.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
To be able to swim with an apex
predator like that, up close--

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
not just one, but a whole pod--
and interact with a family.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.060 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate enough to be
able to even hunt with them

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:90%
side by side.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
When they're catching
herring, they

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
try to get them into what
they call a bait ball.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And they swim around and they
actually bring it up from deep,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.015 align:middle line:90%
deep down.

00:10:36.015 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
The herring up in
Norway, they're

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.640 align:middle line:84%
hard in hiding in
these deep fjords,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
kind of on idle.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:84%
In the winter
season, they are just

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:84%
waiting to go down and
spawn when spring comes,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
so they're just kind
of sitting there, not

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:90%
spending too much energy.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.640 align:middle line:84%
But they have stored all
this energy to stay there,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:84%
so they're big and
fat, and that's

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:90%
what the killer whales want.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And the males send a
young male down-- a scout.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's also, I
think, we've kind of

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle line:84%
found out-- that's
what I saw-- they have

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:90%
this white patch on the belly.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So when they turn,
the light reflects,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.993 align:middle line:84%
and it's like a scare
signal, and the fish

00:11:09.993 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:84%
start to swim
towards the surface,

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's when
they can catch them.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the middle
of all this havoc and all

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:90%
this craziness.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Had killer whales
brush right next to me.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.120 align:middle line:84%
My only fear was
that they thought

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I was going to steal the food.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I was not afraid that
they would attack me.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I tend not to be
a fearful person.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't live my
life out of fear.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:90%
I live it out of passion.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And I really was curious to get
to know these animals better

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:40.270 align:middle line:90%
and see them.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And they have big, beautiful
smiles and big teeth.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And a big male, a
big bull, is 10 tons.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So the flukes are
like a grown person--

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:90%
6, 7, 8 feet long each.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The dorsal fin-- you know,
this erect dorsal fin that you

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:84%
see from the healthy
population of killer whales,

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:90%
it's also 8-feet tall.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:90%
So it's a gigantic animal.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the water, that
also enlarges a bit more--

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:90%
about 30%.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.878 align:middle line:84%
You're like-- it's a dinosaur,
right in front of you.

00:12:12.878 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:90%
They come from that time, even.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So just to be there
is so mind blowing

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:90%
that you don't feel fear.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:84%
That's my honest impression
of being with them.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe when you reflect
on it or something--

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I had one incidence
where I got scared,

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:90%
but that's different than fear.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I got really afraid--

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:90%
not afraid.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:90%
No-- afraid, no.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I got scared-- or shocked
because a young killer

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
whale came sprinting in
and took a bite of my fin.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:90%
I had carbon fins on.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I also had a monofin, but at
that time I had carbon fins on.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was just like a
little toddler or a teenager--

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:90%
you know, curious.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:90%
What is this guy doing here?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I'll just see if I can
literally "pull his leg."

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So he raced in and
took a little bite-- but just

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.300 align:middle line:90%
a nibble.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Just a nibble.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But I was about to go
up and reach the surface

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and I just looked down and
I saw this huge black thing

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
racing in, you know, [LAUGHS]
taking a bite of my leg.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was like
[BRGGG] it's even--

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and the food is like--

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.827 align:middle line:84%
bubbles just explode out
of my mouth, like ahh!

00:13:13.827 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like I'm a
"Superman," you know?

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] I'm just human, but
I tend not to live out of

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.133 align:middle line:84%
fear-- out of
interest and passion.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:24.031 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:24.031 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.280 align:middle line:84%
The reason breathing
is so powerful is

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:90%
because everybody can do it.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And we all breathing, actually,
about 30,000 times each day.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And this alone is
the first thing

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:90%
that people don't realize.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
They're breathing
25,000 to 30,000 times.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Why not make the best of it?

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, we
are not taught how

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to breathe in this modern
day and age, so we lost that.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.530 align:middle line:84%
That's lost in translation,
from other cultures--

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
all cultures throughout
thousands of years

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
have this deep
tradition in breathing,

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.330 align:middle line:84%
connecting the breath
to the mind to the heart

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
to the spirit to love
to compassion to health,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.450 align:middle line:90%
And performance.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So in modern science, when
science becomes too arrogant

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and too conservative,
we tend to discard

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.750 align:middle line:84%
some of all this knowledge
that's been there and passed

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:90%
down from generations.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
try to bring back.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:84%
So from a background
as a scientist

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and from the peak
performance in sports,

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I also have a profound interest
in the timeless wisdom--

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:84%
so yoga, meditation,
and breathwork.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think it started
because I swam in my pool.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I actually-- I was much
more below the surface,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.952 align:middle line:84%
like most kids, basically,
when I was young.

00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I was a competitive swimmer,
but I got hell from my coaches

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.535 align:middle line:84%
because I would love to
dive under and sit and wait

00:14:49.535 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
till the guys had done two laps
and then I would start again.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So kind of like cheating,
but because it was fun.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then also just to
test my capabilities.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So in my home, I would
dive with my brother,

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and we would throw little
animals in-- rubber animals.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I was allergic, as a
child, to guinea pigs.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I had guinea pigs and we
had to get rid of those.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I was diving
for all these animals.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.812 align:middle line:84%
And on one breath, see how
many animals we could catch.

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%
And at that same time--

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I was five years old--

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
I developed severe asthma
from those guinea pigs and all

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:84%
the grass and all the
hay and all this stuff

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:90%
we brought into the house.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was a very
active child, and I'm

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:84%
absolutely certain
I would have gotten

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:84%
this diagnosis of ADHD
stamped right in my forehead

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:90%
if it had been today.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But I was just a very energetic
child, very curious by nature.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And that shift in
my everyday life--

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.013 align:middle line:84%
going from being very strong
and kind of athletic--

00:15:44.013 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:84%
even as a child,
a little monkey--

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:84%
I ran around all the time;
I had so much energy--

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:90%
to suddenly just being quiet.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, from this
horrible feeling of not

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.354 align:middle line:90%
being able to get enough air.

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
[WHEEZES SHARPLY] Painful--
like this wheezing.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:84%
[WHEEZES SHARPLY] I
remember it especially

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:90%
before falling asleep.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
I was, like I said,
about five years old.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:11.085 align:middle line:84%
So I think, as a
child, your body

00:16:11.085 --> 00:16:13.210 align:middle line:84%
stores memories in a
different way than your brain,

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:84%
so it's probably something
that I worked through.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.310 align:middle line:90%
But it probably stuck with me.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, I think
it was kind of a gift.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
So when I was four and
a half, five years old,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:32.300 align:middle line:84%
I got to understand the
importance of breathing.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So going from being a normal
child, running around,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
suddenly there
was something that

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.050 align:middle line:84%
stopped me from doing what
I loved-- running, catching

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:90%
animals.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Even, I cried like
a baby when we

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
had to give those guinea
pigs to another family

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:90%
because we couldn't keep them.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that
understanding of breath

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
and what it does for
your everyday life

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and for your performance--
because I already did swimming

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
at that time--

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%
really stuck with me.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So then I went on to
become a biologist.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:90%
I went into medicine.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.849 align:middle line:90%
I did the PhD and my research.

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And for those 15 years of
studying biology and medicine,

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:16.367 align:middle line:84%
we have done every test you can
imagine on my lungs, on my--

00:17:16.367 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I eventually "cured
myself" from the asthma,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
so the breathwork
really helped in that.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've
seen over and over again.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.039 align:middle line:84%
So all those things led
up to me putting all that

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:90%
into a framework.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:90%
I call it Breatheology.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's a system where you
use meditation, breathing,

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and mindfulness, and basically
just awareness of the breath.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the basic idea.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the first
step-- being aware.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.993 align:middle line:84%
I can actually control
this breathing.

00:17:42.993 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
explaining to people,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.030 align:middle line:84%
you have a vagus nerve--
the 10th cranial nerve.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It sits in your control center
in the back of your neck, so

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.710 align:middle line:90%
to speak, top of the brainstem.

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And it sends out
this nerve, which

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:90%
is called the wandering nerve.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve means
the wandering nerve.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest
nerve that we have.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:90%
3 feet long.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:90%
So almost 1 meter.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.957 align:middle line:84%
And this nerve goes
straight into your heart.

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And it goes to your lungs.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.957 align:middle line:84%
And it goes, actually,
to all your intestines.

00:18:13.957 --> 00:18:18.415 align:middle line:84%
So from understanding breathing
and that you can actually

00:18:18.415 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
get control of your heart-- this
is what many people don't get,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:21.957 align:middle line:90%
especially scientists.

00:18:21.957 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:84%
They're like, but how can
you lower your heart rate?

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And I always ask people,
have you been stressed?

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:90%
Can you raise your heart rate?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, sure.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.160 align:middle line:90%
It goes up when I get nervous.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Do the opposite.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Lower your heart rate.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Use your breathing.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Understand the incredible
power of your mind

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:90%
connected with breathwork.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So when you lower your
heart rate, what happens?

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.070 align:middle line:90%
Blood pressure goes down.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:44.120 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline production
is minimized.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin, dopamine, all
those other "happy hormones,"

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.770 align:middle line:84%
as I call them, have
more time to be produced.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
And since adrenaline and--

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.260 align:middle line:84%
they are like two
different systems.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
They can't be active
at the same time.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like a dual
system, like a tree.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So one is the
sympathetic system.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the adrenaline, the
cortisol, the stress.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.310 align:middle line:90%
It's called fight and flight.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.373 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the parasympathetic.

00:19:12.373 --> 00:19:13.790 align:middle line:84%
That's called the
rest and digest.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's the relaxed,
regenerative, feeling good,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
feeling relaxed system.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So both are very important in
survival and in regeneration,

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.480 align:middle line:84%
but we live way too much
in the stress system.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So when people
understand, oh my gosh,

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I actually have the
ability, with a simple thing

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
as breathing, to connect
to my heart and my lungs.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the biggest
thing the science hasn't caught

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:84%
on to yet [CHUCKLES] is the
connection between the heart

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.190 align:middle line:90%
and the lungs and the mind--

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:84%
meaning the brain--
and behind all that,

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
the spirit, which of course
doesn't exist in science.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But that triumvirate,
those three powers--

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:84%
your heart, your
lungs, and your mind--

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
the mind being able
to control this--

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle line:90%
affects everything in your life.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Not just in a physical level.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Also on a spiritual level
and emotional level--

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:84%
how are you perceived
by other people,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:90%
how you perceive things.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Because that energy
is transmitted

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
from you, both in your
electric energy in your heart,

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:84%
also in your brain that's
producing electric energy,

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:90%
even your gut and peptides.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of new things
that science is finding out

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:90%
from Chinese medicine.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:84%
So there is an intelligence in
different parts of the body,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and when you can tap
into that intelligence

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:84%
it becomes more spiritual
and much more powerful

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
because it gives you the
true power of humanity,

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:84%
which is using
breath and mind work

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.980 align:middle line:90%
and connecting to your organs.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So this is what people have
known in India and in yoga

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's been described
just in different words.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.952 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually
read the Upanishads,

00:20:50.952 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:84%
if you read the
old scriptures, you

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:84%
will understand what
they are saying,

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:84%
even though some
numbers seem strange.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- like they
say that can fly.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:58.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:59.490 align:middle line:90%
So what does it mean?

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:84%
It probably means that
they can remove themselves

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.330 align:middle line:84%
to another place or dream
or visualize things--

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:90%
so they go somewhere else.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've had several
expansions of my mind--

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:84%
these kind of
surreal experiences.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
I've never done drugs,
but I'm high on life

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:90%
so I don't need to.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
But being able to
go other places

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and feeling sincerely that
you can travel to any place

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:90%
and touch anything--

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
also behind you-- those
expansions of your mind

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:84%
occur when you do breathwork,
or they can occur.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can train
yourself to reach that.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Like any other thing in
life, when you train more,

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:90%
you become more successful.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.216 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:84%
I think a big reason why we
have been so disconnected

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to breathing and to our
bodies and our minds

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and our spirits is
because science has become

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:90%
progressively more arrogant.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.620 align:middle line:90%
It's always been strict and--

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm a scientist
myself, so I'm not

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:84%
bashing all scientists in the
world just for their ignorance,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.860 align:middle line:84%
but not being open
to other ideas

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to prove
everything with measurements

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
or with energies or signals
that are so delicate and so

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.430 align:middle line:84%
finely tuned that they're
hard to actually measure,

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean
it doesn't exist.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.470 align:middle line:90%
So that's the paradigm.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think the breathwork
is so important.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
make a shift now

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
in this day and age,
because we need it.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
7, 8 billion people

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
on the planet
collectively starting

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
to be more aware of breathwork
and the energy change,

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be a
shift of a paradigm.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.172 align:middle line:84%
And I think especially the
awareness of breathing alone--

00:22:56.172 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
the fact that people
start to understand,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
wow, I can just consciously
tell myself I need to breathe,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and they can tap into
this ancient superpower

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Vedic times, of the
Indian traditional yoga,

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.850 align:middle line:90%
meditation, breathwork--

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and then when you start to feel
better, than you do it more.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Then you create what's called
a conditioned response.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.733 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes a good
habit, basically.

00:23:17.733 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:84%
So your nervous system
starts to remember, oh, yeah,

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.942 align:middle line:84%
when I did that breathing,
that felt pretty good.

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:84%
My digestion went up and
I lost a bit of weight

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and I actually felt
pretty damn good.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So then you start to do it more.

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Then comes the real
bonus-- so the superpower

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:84%
of breathing, which
is the mind work.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you can get
to a point where

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:84%
you can start to expand your
mind, expand your heart,

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and expand your lungs,
obviously, physiologically,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:84%
then you're also more
open to the world.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And then you start to see that--

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.870 align:middle line:90%
you connect the dots.

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.537 align:middle line:84%
So you start to understand that
when you breathe more slowly,

00:23:52.537 --> 00:23:53.620 align:middle line:90%
your heart rate goes down.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.990 align:middle line:84%
When you have a balance
between your heart rate

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.823 align:middle line:84%
and your lungs and
everything is evened out,

00:23:58.823 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
then you're much more calm,
meaning that you don't produce

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:84%
all the stress
hormones, your brain

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:84%
has time to think, be creative,
reflective, loving, kind, not

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.802 align:middle line:84%
living in this
stressed, scarcity mode.

00:24:11.802 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
breathwork comes in.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's a forgotten art.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's also, of course,
why I'm doing all the work

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.972 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing with Breatheology and
the breathwork and the breath

00:24:20.972 --> 00:24:22.480 align:middle line:90%
holding.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to bring
that back alive.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Because especially in
the yogic traditions,

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:90%
they talk about the fourth step.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Ashtanga yoga is not
usually what people think,

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:90%
like physical workout--

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Warrior pose and
things like that.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:90%
Ashtanga means "eight limbs."

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's the eight
steps to enlightenment.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth
step is pranayama.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And prana is the life
energy or universal energy.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It's also called Chi
or Qi in Chinese.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Every tradition has
had its own name.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's this life force within
that we can't really measure

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.300 align:middle line:90%
or describe.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.590 align:middle line:90%
We can sometimes.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes not.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:90%
But we can feel it.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy on a
beautiful morning when you're

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.060 align:middle line:84%
walking on the beach
[INHALES] and you're

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:90%
basically high on life.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to tap
into that, we also

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:84%
understand the deeper
traditions of breathwork

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:90%
related to health and society.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Because the power of
breathing is actually

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.880 align:middle line:84%
because every cell needs oxygen.
That's the simple science fact.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So in India, in the
Indian traditions,

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:84%
they called a cell
"little life."

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So every single cell is a
little life, which is true.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
If you look scientifically at
a cell, it has mitochondria.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:48.430 align:middle line:84%
That's like the energy
production store unit.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:90%
You have all the proteins.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:90%
You have all the enzymes.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.600 align:middle line:90%
You have everything in there.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's like a small
globe, with water--

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
salt water-- and
everything in there,

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:84%
with combustion and oxygen and
electron transportation chain.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.360 align:middle line:84%
All the energy production
units are there.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.530 align:middle line:90%
So it's self-contained.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:84%
You can take a little cell,
put it in a Petri dish,

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:84%
and it will live for
quite a long time.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So when you get to
understand that you

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:84%
have 30 trillion
cells in your body

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and that every single
cell needs oxygen

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.550 align:middle line:84%
because we're aerobic organisms,
meaning that we need air

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:90%
and oxygen to produce energy.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:90%
That's how we produce energy--

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:29.192 align:middle line:84%
water, air, and a little
bit of sugar or energy gas.

00:26:29.192 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:90%
That's how we produce energy.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And when people tap into
that, they're like, wow.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.241 align:middle line:84%
I can change my energy
levels, my health status,

00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:37.033 align:middle line:84%
and everything, just
from breathing better.

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:39.991 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:39.991 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:90%


00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.568 align:middle line:84%
I think it's disastrous
that we are not

00:26:46.568 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:90%
more connected with our breath.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is the real
gift that was passed down

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
through generations from the
timeless wisdom of all cultures

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
around the world, when they
were more connected with nature

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and the body and the food
they we're eating from nature.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have lost that because
science can be arrogant,

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:90%
science can be proud.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And the irony is that science
is based on things you see.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:84%
You observe things, then
you look at the results,

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and then you either say, OK,
this is a scientific fact,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:90%
or you just discard it.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Then, every 20, 50 years,
you change that belief.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.170 align:middle line:90%
And science changed.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.450 align:middle line:90%
So it's flexible.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Because we learn new things.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so sad
that we lost this connection

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:84%
with breathwork and
being in the moment,

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
because that is the most
beautiful gift of breath,

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
is that it makes it easy
for you to bring yourself

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.340 align:middle line:90%
into the present.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:90%
We live so much in the past--

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
fears, our mind is so occupied
with things that have happened,

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:90%
and we can never change that.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] What
happened has happened.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.602 align:middle line:90%
That's never going to change.

00:28:11.602 --> 00:28:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We can change the way we
look at what happened,

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and we can do inner work
and we can do breathwork.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.010 align:middle line:84%
We are also very worried
about the future.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So we live so much
in the future,

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and nobody knows what's coming,
and we can't change the future.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.855 align:middle line:84%
So breathing brings you
into the present moment.

00:28:26.855 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
everybody can do.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.022 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
go to a yoga workshop.

00:28:30.022 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
buy fancy equipment.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.617 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is just
sit down where you are

00:28:35.617 --> 00:28:36.450 align:middle line:90%
and stop to breathe.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.867 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter if you do it

00:28:37.867 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:84%
from your mouth, which is
wrong, or from your nose, which

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.220 align:middle line:90%
is the correct way.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.280 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, you
just need to start.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And then after a while, you
get to understand that wow,

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.320 align:middle line:84%
when I breathe through the nose,
[INHALES] [EXHALES] it feels

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:90%
pretty relaxing.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to understand
that your shoulders come down

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:90%
and that your mind follows.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
what science is not

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:84%
seeing or understanding and
what I'm trying to bring back,

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
also from a scientific
angle, is the fact

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that when you connect
with your breathing,

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.380 align:middle line:84%
you connect with everything
in your physical body

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:90%
and the nervous system.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually rewire
your nervous system.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what I try to
do when I teach people.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can get rid of bad
habits and unconscious breathing

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:32.010 align:middle line:84%
patterns that are not
helpful to your performance

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.660 align:middle line:90%
or your daily health.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you can start
creating new patterns

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and new connections
in your brain,

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:43.808 align:middle line:84%
and you can make every cell
come alive at a high level.

00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:46.796 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:46.796 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:84%
The negative things with
unconscious breathing--

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.690 align:middle line:84%
that is, not being
aware of your breath--

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
are all the things
we're seeing today.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Stress.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:90%
When I was a child--

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm 43 years old--

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard of
anyone having stress.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.120 align:middle line:90%
It was not even--

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.830 align:middle line:84%
it was coined before
that by Hans Selye,

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:84%
who said that "Without
stress, there is no life."

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So meaning that resistance,
without difficulties,

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:90%
there is no growth.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.480 align:middle line:90%
There is no development.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.930 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on how you
look on challenges-- if it's

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.730 align:middle line:90%
a problem or a challenge.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think all the illnesses
we see-- stress leading

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to cardiovascular disease,
leading to depression,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
it's all a symptom of
the fact that we're not

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
connected with ourselves
and nature anymore.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.003 align:middle line:90%
It's this huge disconnect.

00:30:52.003 --> 00:30:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing
about breathing

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.040 align:middle line:90%
is that it's completely free.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:90%
It's right in front of us.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It's right under
our nose, literally.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And it does so many good things,
because not only does it change

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:84%
your physicality-- so you
relax more in your body,

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.700 align:middle line:84%
your muscles become
more relaxed,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the blood transfuses the tissue
better and takes toxins away

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and brings more oxygen
to every single cell--

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:84%
but also the fact that your
mind becomes more alive and more

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.020 align:middle line:90%
controlled, more happy.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens when you
breathe is that every time you

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.918 align:middle line:84%
take a breath, your
brain starts to move,

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:84%
because we have a
hydrostatic system.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
The blood and the
lymphatic system,

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:90%
it's all "water," basically.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a liquid.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So when we breathe,
[INHALES] first of all,

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.960 align:middle line:90%
the pulse starts to go up.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:84%
The heart rate is racing
because we expand the lungs.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:44.912 align:middle line:90%
The brain is moving.

00:31:44.912 --> 00:31:47.690 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] Then we exhale.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES] Pressure goes down.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.820 align:middle line:90%
We relax.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:90%
Heart rate goes down.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Blood pressure goes down.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Brain falls back.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's like rocking
a little baby.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:03.033 align:middle line:84%
And you want to do that gently
and in a nice and soft rhythm.

00:32:03.033 --> 00:32:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how
people breathe.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:84%
People breathe
[BREATHES RAPIDLY, UNEVENLY]

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.770 align:middle line:84%
unconsciously and stressed
and without awareness.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And the brain-- it's
like in a boxing match.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.140 align:middle line:90%
It's in a fight all the time.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Even at night, when
people have sleep apnea

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and have these bad habits
translating into bad sleep,

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.557 align:middle line:90%
the brain never gets rest.

00:32:27.557 --> 00:32:28.390 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:84%
It means that the brain has
many different frequencies.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It operates at different
electrical levels.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.270 align:middle line:84%
So alpha state is the dream
state, the flow state,

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
where you want to go if
you have peak performance

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and want to take it
to the next level.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.470 align:middle line:84%
You can also have beta, which
is awareness-- when you're

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.870 align:middle line:84%
listening, when you're
analyzing things,

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:90%
that's the normal situation.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And you have other
frequencies in the higher

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.110 align:middle line:90%
states of meditation.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But from breathwork alone, you
can take control of your mind.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.370 align:middle line:90%
So that is the secret of yoga.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
The secret of yoga is that
you quiet those monkeys.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.360 align:middle line:84%
In Indian traditions, they
talk about the monkey mind.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So the monkey mind is like
a little wild teenager.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:90%
It's running everywhere.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for anyone,
no matter your training,

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:16.870 align:middle line:90%
to control your mind.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult. We have
so many inputs all the time.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what you
learn in meditation--

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:84%
to focus and to cut those inputs
out, or take the inputs in

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and accept them, so they
become just omnipresent,

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.930 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a
disturbing element.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.870 align:middle line:84%
But from breathing,
you can actually

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:40.780 align:middle line:84%
start to change the way the
brain is thinking and moving.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's from a physical control
to a neurological control

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:50.290 align:middle line:84%
to a mental control to
a spiritual control.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So that progression
is the path of yoga.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:90%
You go from physicality.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Those are called asanas.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a workout--

00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:90%
body work.

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.115 align:middle line:84%
Then you become more flexible
in your knees, your joints.

00:34:02.115 --> 00:34:03.790 align:middle line:90%
You can sit in the Lotus pose.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
you want to do this,

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:90%
it's exactly the same reason.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:84%
You do not want to be
distracted in your mind.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:84%
So if you move your body,
there is a distraction

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:14.469 align:middle line:90%
because it's called feedback.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.489 align:middle line:84%
The brain tells these
muscles to move,

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.810 align:middle line:84%
but the muscle is
then sending a signal

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:90%
back-- yeah, yeah, got that.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:90%
I moved.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.962 align:middle line:84%
And the brain says,
OK, that's great.

00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Then just stay there until
you do another movement.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:28.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you move, you
have distraction.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.238 align:middle line:84%
So in meditation, it's all
about sitting still for hours.

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot do that if
you don't have a strong back,

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.072 align:middle line:84%
if you're not flexible
in your knees,

00:34:37.072 --> 00:34:38.739 align:middle line:90%
if you can't open your hips.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So all those things,
it's just basic workout.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's where, when you've
seen fitness centers and gyms,

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.232 align:middle line:84%
you have yoga, all
this-- it's great.

00:34:47.232 --> 00:34:51.929 align:middle line:84%
It's better than not
doing work with the body,

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's very primitive,
because you're

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.120 align:middle line:84%
disconnected from your mind
and from the spiritual aspect.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.140 align:middle line:90%
But it's still OK.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a beginning.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you move into
higher levels.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.165 align:middle line:90%
So those are the more ethical.

00:35:03.165 --> 00:35:06.350 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:84%
The levels above the physical
level are more ethics--

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.940 align:middle line:84%
so how you treat other people,
how you treat yourself,

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.740 align:middle line:90%
that you're kind to yourself.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Yama, niyama.

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you move
into the fourth step

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.290 align:middle line:84%
of yoga, which is pranayama, and
that's where the shift changes.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.810 align:middle line:90%
That's where the shift occurs.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So you move from
the physicality--

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:34.770 align:middle line:84%
from the ethical-- so society
and how you react and act--

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.210 align:middle line:90%
interact with other people.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.778 align:middle line:84%
And then you move into
pranayama, the breathwork.

00:35:38.778 --> 00:35:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you start to connect

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.990 align:middle line:84%
the body and the
physicality and society

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:90%
to a higher spiritual level--

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.380 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So awareness, and a
more broad awareness.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I'm trying
to bring into the world

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.785 align:middle line:84%
is the part of
holding your breath.

00:35:58.785 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Because no matter what
happens in your life and you

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.690 align:middle line:84%
have stress-- if you
hold your breath,

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.210 align:middle line:90%
you will quiet that monkey mind.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you just take us a slow
breath in [INHALES] and stop,

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:90%
the mind stops.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.327 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:15.327 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Because the brain is not moving.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not in that middle
of the boxing match.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not getting knocked
down all the time,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and there is time to reflect
and time to feel the body.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:29.832 align:middle line:84%
And the body is then balanced
in the feedback loop.

00:36:29.832 --> 00:36:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Then you can think
of other things.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- and I call
it meditation under water.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:84%
But that's just
something I call it.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.047 align:middle line:84%
When you hold your breath
underwater for a prolonged

00:36:38.047 --> 00:36:41.450 align:middle line:84%
time, you reach all these
wonderful different states.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's because you
tap into the alpha state,

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:84%
so the brain has a
different electric charge.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
open your brain.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, science
has proven this as well,

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.080 align:middle line:90%
so then everyone's happy.

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the brain
opens in so many new areas

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.470 align:middle line:84%
when we reach that
state, meaning

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that you tap into different
things that were not

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.603 align:middle line:90%
accessible before.

00:37:05.603 --> 00:37:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you then
start to connect

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.740 align:middle line:84%
those areas and those thoughts
and basically that network

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:15.750 align:middle line:84%
of trillions of nervous cells,
you get the superpowers.

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:19.918 align:middle line:84%
That's also why, in yoga,
you can develop intuition.

00:37:19.918 --> 00:37:21.960 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is very
good for relationships--

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.620 align:middle line:84%
for being a good father, a
good mother, a good friend,

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.143 align:middle line:90%
but also for being a good boss.

00:37:27.143 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So those are some of the
things I've been pushing on

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.580 align:middle line:84%
for the last 10, 15 years with
the system of Breatheology,

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:84%
to explain well,
breathwork also does

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:38.430 align:middle line:84%
help your business in the sense
that you become more intuitive.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.110 align:middle line:90%
You make the right decisions.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.250 align:middle line:90%
I was helping a big bank--

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.667 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
mention the name--

00:37:42.667 --> 00:37:45.308 align:middle line:84%
I was helping a big bank many
years ago with the brokers

00:37:45.308 --> 00:37:47.350 align:middle line:84%
because they needed to
make very quick decisions.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.100 align:middle line:84%
This was millions of
dollars every second.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:51.600 align:middle line:90%
They made a wrong choice.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's about gut
feeling and about making

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:90%
the right decision.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.590 align:middle line:90%
And breathwork does that to you.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So I try to bring in the
element from pranayama

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:03.730 align:middle line:90%
that is the not breathing.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I think there is an
overemphasis on breathing.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.500 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's good that
we think about breathing.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.000 align:middle line:84%
It's better to think
about breathing

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.522 align:middle line:84%
than not think about it, but
it's just one side of the coin.

00:38:13.522 --> 00:38:14.980 align:middle line:84%
We also need to
see the other side.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:18.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the yin and the yang, the
day and the night, the moon

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:90%
and the sun.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And and I think that freediving
brings that extra element in,

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:26.050 align:middle line:90%
of breath holding.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And we prove it scientifically,
because scientists-- there

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.340 align:middle line:84%
are many nice
scientists and they're

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:31.870 align:middle line:90%
very intrigued and interested.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So we have studied
for many years spleen

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:38.050 align:middle line:84%
contraction, extra red
blood cells shooting

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.430 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It's "natural doping"
is just what I call it.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:47.020 align:middle line:84%
You get more oxygen that can
be tied to the hemoglobin

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.290 align:middle line:84%
molecule, so you get
like a higher octane.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why you get
more energetic.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.400 align:middle line:84%
That's also why-- I don't care
that much about this stuff,

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.750 align:middle line:84%
but for people, especially
women, that treat their skin

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and care about the skin
and their appearance,

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:84%
it gives you cleaner and nicer
skin, more energetic skin,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.360 align:middle line:84%
because you're cleaning waste
products and toxins better

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.950 align:middle line:84%
when you breathe
better and every cell

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.130 align:middle line:84%
gets to really optimize
its performance.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And then also, you
get clear eyes.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.050 align:middle line:84%
All this is described in
the Vedic yoga tradition.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.810 align:middle line:90%
You get more wide eyes.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And generally, it just means
that you get better health.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system
gets boosted, meaning

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.410 align:middle line:84%
you don't fall ill
so easily, and you

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.340 align:middle line:90%
have more resistance to stress.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.905 align:middle line:84%
So this also means you
can survive better and be

00:39:30.905 --> 00:39:32.530 align:middle line:84%
more happy, frankly,
because you're not

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
fighting pain or
illness in your body,

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:37.644 align:middle line:84%
so you come from a place
of comfort and joy.

00:39:37.644 --> 00:39:41.102 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:41.102 --> 00:39:44.752 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.752 --> 00:39:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a lot of
new interesting things

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.970 align:middle line:84%
that will see the day of
light regarding breathwork

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and the health
status of the body.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:40:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Alkaline diet-- changing the
alkalinity in your bloodstream,

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.090 align:middle line:90%
meaning the pH value--

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.880 align:middle line:84%
we all have to be at
a very fine level.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.120 align:middle line:90%
It can't change too much.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Then we don't feel well.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the body is not
just breathing oxygen,

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:19.440 align:middle line:84%
it's actually also producing
other gases in the bloodstream

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:84%
and those are connected
directly with the pH value.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So when you breathe
more or less,

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:30.097 align:middle line:84%
you change the pH value
of your bloodstream.

00:40:30.097 --> 00:40:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And that of course
affects everything,

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:37.170 align:middle line:84%
from digestion to muscular
energy production and so forth.

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And with breathwork,
you can actually

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:40.950 align:middle line:90%
tap into changing that.

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you hyperventilate like
crazy, you can change the pH,

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
or you can breathe slowly
and preserve more CO2.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:56.352 align:middle line:84%
And CO2 is also a very
overlooked gas molecule.

00:40:56.352 --> 00:40:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, for hundreds
of years, people

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.700 align:middle line:84%
have known about Carbon
Dioxide, CO2, as well,

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.700 align:middle line:90%
which is very important.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.283 align:middle line:84%
It's not just oxygen, but there
is a balance between those two

00:41:04.283 --> 00:41:06.390 align:middle line:84%
because they break
down chemically.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
scientist who said

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that over the supply of
oxygen, carbon dioxide spreads

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:16.950 align:middle line:90%
its protective wings.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.407 align:middle line:84%
So in the physical body,
CO2 is also very important.

00:41:20.407 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe
correctly, you'll

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:26.340 align:middle line:84%
find that balance of
the oxygen and CO2--

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:90%
the way it dissociates.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So from breathing,
you can actually

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.300 align:middle line:84%
also heal yourself,
or cure yourself,

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.410 align:middle line:90%
from different allergies.

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen that in my work.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I've had several people that
I've been helping for other

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.720 align:middle line:84%
reasons, post-polio patients,
but they have come to me after,

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.820 align:middle line:84%
saying that first of all, they
have increased lung capacity,

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.830 align:middle line:84%
so that's great because
"scientifically"

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:48.793 align:middle line:90%
you cannot do that.

00:41:48.793 --> 00:41:50.460 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a
medical book, of course

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.500 align:middle line:84%
you can, if you work
with your lungs.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Second of all,
several of them have

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.950 align:middle line:84%
they've told me that their
allergies have improved.

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:00.660 align:middle line:84%
People with asthma--
like myself,

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.370 align:middle line:84%
being a child with
severe asthma--

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.670 align:middle line:84%
several times when
I've worked with people

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.860 align:middle line:84%
or talked with people in
the freediving community,

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.010 align:middle line:84%
they have completely
stopped taking

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.510 align:middle line:90%
asthma medicine and inhalers.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot
in breathwork that I

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.520 align:middle line:84%
think will see that
the day of light

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.250 align:middle line:84%
now and in the next
few years and make

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:84%
a huge shift in the way we
look at illness and prevention.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the way that
the health system--

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.570 align:middle line:84%
today, it's actually
not a health system.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:33.260 align:middle line:90%
It's an illness system.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a much higher
risk of becoming ill

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.470 align:middle line:84%
if you go to hospital because
of all the sick people

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:40.350 align:middle line:84%
there, obviously, but
also because you're not

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:42.450 align:middle line:90%
curing the symptoms.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:45.600 align:middle line:84%
You're not really taking
care of the root cause.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.270 align:middle line:90%
You're just putting some pills.

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Like with children, with
the difficulties of focusing

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.028 align:middle line:90%
or balancing the energy.

00:42:55.028 --> 00:42:56.820 align:middle line:84%
You give them some
Ritalin or you give them

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.230 align:middle line:84%
different things that
completely change

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:02.490 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics of the natural
production of hormones

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:03.875 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:43:03.875 --> 00:43:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
with breathwork,

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.710 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to see now
in the next just few years

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.070 align:middle line:84%
is that science will catch
up with the understanding

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:15.680 align:middle line:84%
from traditional, timeless
wisdom from the Vedic--

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.330 align:middle line:84%
the way that food can
change your alkalinity,

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:22.260 align:middle line:84%
the way that breathwork
actually can change

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.970 align:middle line:90%
the way the brain is working.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And then another
thing about breathwork

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.620 align:middle line:84%
is also that when you
breathe with your nose,

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.500 align:middle line:84%
you also breathe
in nitric oxide.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is just 10 years
ago that's three scientists

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.630 align:middle line:84%
were awarded the Nobel
Prize, discovering

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:84%
that nitric oxide actually
expands muscular tissue.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So your blood vessels
expand in your lungs--

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:84%
the alveoli expand-- when you
do breathwork with the nose.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's only been
discovered in this decade.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So there are many new
things that has been known

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.510 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of
years in India--

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:58.230 align:middle line:84%
that's why they do breathwork
and do all these things that

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:59.292 align:middle line:90%
people see--

00:43:59.292 --> 00:44:01.740 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES] it's because it works.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they felt
better and felt more healthy,

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:90%
so they just kept doing it.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Like acupuncture in China.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They could tap into
different energy systems.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same
with breathwork.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.822 align:middle line:84%
When we start to
understand the power

00:44:12.822 --> 00:44:15.610 align:middle line:84%
we can unleash on ourselves
in our everyday lives.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But also, in the medical world,
we'll see a tremendous shift

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.664 align:middle line:84%
and we will take health and
performance to the next level.

00:44:25.664 --> 00:44:29.122 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:29.122 --> 00:44:33.080 align:middle line:90%


00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is
a huge contributor

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of the success
I've had in my life.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.630 align:middle line:90%
I call it imagery.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.730 align:middle line:84%
That's more a term
from sports psychology,

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:48.520 align:middle line:84%
because visualization makes
you think that you're just

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.860 align:middle line:90%
seeing something, in my mind.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:90%
So I like the word imagery.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.450 align:middle line:90%
Imagery means that you imagine.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:45:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So you use all your senses
to live an experience that

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:02.450 align:middle line:90%
hasn't happened yet.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you engage
all your senses--

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:11.170 align:middle line:84%
your tactile, your auditory,
the olfactory, taste--

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.880 align:middle line:90%
the more senses, the better--

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and inner vision--
so the inner sight--

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.110 align:middle line:84%
when you get all
those senses going,

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:24.660 align:middle line:84%
you create a very
strong representation

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:29.130 align:middle line:84%
of an image or an
episode that you

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.650 align:middle line:90%
want to happen in your life.

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And this means that
everything in your body--

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
your senses, your tactile, your
thoughts, the way you move,

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that way you interact with
people, decisions you make--

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:46.120 align:middle line:84%
repels or propels you
in that direction.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:84%
It leads you-- you can
say imagery leads you

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.730 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of
the dream vision.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.915 align:middle line:84%
There's this dream that
you want to go there.

00:45:57.915 --> 00:45:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So I think what many
people don't understand,

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.225 align:middle line:84%
if you're a bit arrogant, like,
ah, just thinking about it

00:46:03.225 --> 00:46:05.100 align:middle line:84%
or visualizing, that
doesn't change anything,

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:09.000 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] it's because
people don't understand

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.680 align:middle line:90%
the power of the mind.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we use all our senses
and we train different senses--

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:17.400 align:middle line:84%
because some people are better
at learning from hearing

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:22.470 align:middle line:84%
things, some people, like
me, need to touch things,

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and other people have
different ways of learning--

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:29.610 align:middle line:84%
but when you can train
all of these skills,

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.070 align:middle line:90%
then it becomes more real.

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Then you can see it.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.700 align:middle line:90%
You can smell it.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:90%
You can touch it.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.100 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.470 align:middle line:90%
You can hear it.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So in your everyday life,
the decisions you make

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.400 align:middle line:90%
leads you in that direction.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And subconsciously--
because consciously,

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.770 align:middle line:90%
you put that dream.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.960 align:middle line:84%
But subconsciously,
everything in your body,

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.340 align:middle line:84%
from your immune system, from
all this inner communication,

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the internal communication
between the cells-- so

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.590 align:middle line:84%
intracellular
communication-- everything

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:05.370 align:middle line:84%
starts to align and help you
to move in that direction.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:09.290 align:middle line:84%
So for me, holding my breath
for 22 minutes was a dream.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:12.435 align:middle line:90%
It was fantasy.

00:47:12.435 --> 00:47:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for many people,
[CHUCKLES] a bit

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.260 align:middle line:90%
crazy, I don't know.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:23.240 align:middle line:84%
But so before I do that,
I become the 22 minutes.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.970 align:middle line:84%
If I'm like, ah, maybe it
can happen someday, or--

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:27.770 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:28.910 align:middle line:90%
It will not happen.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Until my subconscious mind
accepts that it will become

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:39.380 align:middle line:84%
a reality, a physical reality,
I cannot manifest this dream I

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.070 align:middle line:90%
have in real life.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I do my dives
or my "performances,"

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:49.280 align:middle line:84%
it's just a manifestation
of a long journey

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of a dream for whatever
reason that has to happen,

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.880 align:middle line:84%
whether it's personnel
or helping humanity,

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.700 align:middle line:90%
whatever that reason is.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And for all the dives I do
and all the visualization,

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:02.920 align:middle line:84%
all the work I do, I always
connect it with breathwork.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.378 align:middle line:84%
Because then, you have like
double up on the efficiency.

00:48:06.378 --> 00:48:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is--
it's very overlooked,

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:84%
even, I think, in
the medical field

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:12.590 align:middle line:90%
and also in sports psychology.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So I try to bring
this to the table.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.680 align:middle line:84%
When you link the breathing to
all the positive reinforcement,

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:84%
all the happy
thoughts, basically--

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.350 align:middle line:84%
all the winning
thoughts, then every time

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:25.840 align:middle line:84%
you breathe on a
more conscious level,

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.500 align:middle line:84%
you ignite that
power of possibility.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.380 align:middle line:90%


00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And it will lead you to
success, in the sense

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.100 align:middle line:90%
that you will reach your goal--

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and especially when the
breathing becomes also

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.550 align:middle line:84%
on the subconscious
level so strong that it

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:46.000 align:middle line:84%
leads your movements,
it leads your thoughts

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.080 align:middle line:90%
in that direction.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So I think the basic thing
with realizing something

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.210 align:middle line:84%
before it happens is
that it prepares you.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:49:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So when you arrive at that
place, it's like coming home.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:04.290 align:middle line:90%
You have been there before.

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's not crazy to
you, but you are maybe

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:10.890 align:middle line:84%
crazy to believe it, but
it's like coming home.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:13.432 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like the
final destination.

00:49:13.432 --> 00:49:16.806 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:16.806 --> 00:49:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I completely understand
people think I'm nuts

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and that breath holding
doesn't change the world

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's it's
kind of suicidal.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.200 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I shifted more to
the Guinness World Records--

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:39.010 align:middle line:84%
the ice diving, holding
my breath for 20 minutes,

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:41.930 align:middle line:90%
22 minutes eventually--

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.430 align:middle line:90%
it's not about me anymore.

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I have my four world titles,
world championship titles,

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and I had eight or
10 world records.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I lost count because it's
not that important to me.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:55.340 align:middle line:84%
If I had 12 or 11 or eight,
doesn't change anything

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:56.570 align:middle line:90%
for me or the world.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:50:00.850 align:middle line:84%
But what I saw when I started
doing these extreme records

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:01.650 align:middle line:90%
in nature--

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:05.570 align:middle line:84%
so when I did my 20
minutes, 10 seconds,

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.160 align:middle line:90%
it was in a shark tank.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So my message was,
to kids, you know,

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.900 align:middle line:90%
sharks are beautiful creatures.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.170 align:middle line:90%
They had 20 minutes to eat me.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:13.970 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:14.990 align:middle line:90%
These were big sharks.

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So I try to embed a
lot of different things

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:90%
in my masterpiece.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.600 align:middle line:90%
So it's not about me anymore.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's about the message I
want to get out to the world.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So sharks on ice,
they don't kill you.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Also, it's boring to look at
a guy for 20 minutes floating,

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:84%
so I thought if there
are some sharks,

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:37.040 align:middle line:84%
they have distraction so the
kids could have a fun time.

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.420 align:middle line:84%
When I dive under ice, it's
to show that the body can

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:40.220 align:middle line:90%
do so much more.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's provoking
science, to say, hey,

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:45.380 align:middle line:84%
there is more to life than
just what you can measure.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, every
measurement device

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I had on exploded
[CHUCKLES] and didn't

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.480 align:middle line:84%
work because of the
freezing cold temperature.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So all the electrical
devices I had on broke.

00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.780 align:middle line:90%
But the body worked.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.130 align:middle line:90%
And the mind worked.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think the most important
message from my freediving

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.060 align:middle line:84%
records is the fact
that it's a metaphor.

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a metaphor for
a huge challenge.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:16.910 align:middle line:84%
You're cold, you have
doubt, you're tired,

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.460 align:middle line:84%
your body is going crazy
because you can't breathe.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.260 align:middle line:84%
You go against the
strongest reflex

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.950 align:middle line:90%
of life, which is breathing.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But when you hold your breath,
you have to go against that.

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So of course you
are close to death.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you're
close to passing out.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But all those things can be
beautiful, if you accept them.

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think the metaphor
of accepting life-- yeah,

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:38.920 align:middle line:90%
we'll die.

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:41.360 align:middle line:84%
We all die at some
point, sooner or later.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.252 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:51:42.252 --> 00:51:43.460 align:middle line:90%
It will happen at some point.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.390 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] You can't change it.

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So that metaphor of being
under huge amounts of stress,

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.640 align:middle line:84%
whether it's holding your
breath for a long time

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:84%
or diving under ice,
freezing temperatures,

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:58.970 align:middle line:84%
but being uncomfortable
in life doesn't

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:00.560 align:middle line:90%
mean that you can't succeed.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.390 align:middle line:84%
So the metaphor
is to show people

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.420 align:middle line:84%
that there is light at
the end of the tunnel.

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.097 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's literally--
when I dive under the ice,

00:52:07.097 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:84%
you're there, but then
the light shines down

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:13.040 align:middle line:84%
from that hole 250 feet ahead
of you, and it welcomes you.

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's like a rebirth.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:17.450 align:middle line:84%
You're [INHALES] taking
your first breath

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:18.530 align:middle line:90%
and you're born again.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the
freediving records

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:23.395 align:middle line:84%
is a metaphor for a
stressful situation,

00:52:23.395 --> 00:52:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that when you know how to
control your mind and use

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.650 align:middle line:84%
visualization,
imagery, breathwork,

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:30.410 align:middle line:84%
eating healthy, surrounding
yourself with people that

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:32.630 align:middle line:84%
believe in you and
support you, you

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.052 align:middle line:90%
can take it to the next level.

00:52:34.052 --> 00:52:37.496 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:37.496 --> 00:52:41.440 align:middle line:90%


00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I think an easier
way to identify

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.730 align:middle line:84%
what's holding you back is
looking at your surroundings--

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:49.750 align:middle line:84%
the people you're around, your
natural surroundings, where

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:52.840 align:middle line:84%
you live, where you
go to work every day--

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and then looking
at your mindset.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.250 align:middle line:90%
What do you want in life?

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And are you happy
with what you have?

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Then that's happiness, I guess.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:04.190 align:middle line:84%
The definition of happiness
is being happy and satisfied.

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you want more,
then you probably

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.390 align:middle line:84%
have to change the situation,
meaning your environment.

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that
internally, through mind work,

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:90%
visualization, breathwork.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You can take the
breath from outside

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:20.350 align:middle line:84%
and take it in so it's
an inner work, reflecting

00:53:20.350 --> 00:53:23.052 align:middle line:84%
on your mind and your
spiritual energy.

00:53:23.052 --> 00:53:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But you can also change
the surroundings.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So what people used to do is
they go traveling, or athletes,

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:31.480 align:middle line:84%
they go to a training camp
and surround themselves

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.120 align:middle line:84%
with the best athletes in
the world in their field.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And if it's got
to be even better,

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.680 align:middle line:84%
you surround yourself
with different athletes,

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:42.250 align:middle line:84%
because you learn new things
from different walks of life.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Same in business.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.680 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
excel in business,

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.650 align:middle line:84%
speak with different people that
are in different businesses.

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:52.390 align:middle line:90%
You'll learn different things.

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you have limiting beliefs,
it's probably not your fault,

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.610 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that it's maybe
your parents or somebody

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:04.980 align:middle line:84%
around you did not set you
free or let you be a little bit

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.890 align:middle line:84%
crazy, but that's not an
excuse for not changing it.

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So you can start to do simple
things, as walking in nature,

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:15.217 align:middle line:84%
starting to work
out a little bit.

00:54:15.217 --> 00:54:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying or
advocating everybody

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.840 align:middle line:84%
should be like a fitness
model, but at least

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.510 align:middle line:84%
just to taking a bit
of responsibility

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:25.380 align:middle line:84%
for your own health,
your body, this temple

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.750 align:middle line:90%
that we are born in.

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:30.890 align:middle line:84%
We should appreciate and
be thankful every day.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think a simple
thing as breathing--

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.340 align:middle line:84%
connecting the
body and the mind--

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is something that people
can start doing right away.

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Because then they get
in tune with the body.

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Literally, they get in tune with
their heart rate and the way

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.550 align:middle line:90%
that the lungs are expanding.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:47.268 align:middle line:90%
And that reflects in the mind.

00:54:47.268 --> 00:54:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
to then understand

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can control
your mind and start

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.180 align:middle line:84%
to go in a different
direction, it

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.250 align:middle line:84%
can lead to unlimited
dreams and possibilities.

00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:01.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.920 align:middle line:84%
The most important
relationship for my success

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.250 align:middle line:84%
has been the relationship
with my grandmother.

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:13.890 align:middle line:84%
When I was five years old,
my grandfather passed,

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:15.348 align:middle line:84%
so she spent a lot
of time with us.

00:55:15.348 --> 00:55:17.432 align:middle line:84%
I'm half Swedish, so she
lived in another country.

00:55:17.432 --> 00:55:18.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm Danish.

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So she would come and stay with
us, and I spent a lot of time

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.960 align:middle line:90%
with my grandmother.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's the one I've loved
the most in my whole life.

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:27.000 align:middle line:90%
And she always believed in me.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.292 align:middle line:84%
She believed in everything
I did, and she supported me.

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:31.080 align:middle line:90%
And she was very smart.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.850 align:middle line:90%
She spoke a lot of languages.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:34.770 align:middle line:84%
She passed on her
next journey recently.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:36.720 align:middle line:84%
She lived to become
almost 101 years old

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and she was absolutely ready,
so everything was fine.

00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And she was strong and
healthy and thankful

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:43.500 align:middle line:90%
to the last minute.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And I learned tremendous amounts
of life, knowledge, and wisdom

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:48.045 align:middle line:90%
from her.

00:55:48.045 --> 00:55:49.920 align:middle line:84%
But she always believed
in me, and she always

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.610 align:middle line:84%
listened to my
projects, crazy things.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.928 align:middle line:84%
She didn't always
like them [CHUCKLES]

00:55:55.928 --> 00:55:57.720 align:middle line:84%
because she was a bit
afraid that something

00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.440 align:middle line:90%
would happen to me.

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.482 align:middle line:84%
So she would say on the
phone, please be careful.

00:56:00.482 --> 00:56:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And, is that a good idea?

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But I know that's
what you want, and I

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.290 align:middle line:84%
think it's wonderful you're
going to try to dive under ice.

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:10.080 align:middle line:84%
It sounds dangerous, but I
think when you want this,

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.690 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be wonderful.

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I took most from
my grandmother, this legacy,

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is from childhood, she was
taking care of from me.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.702 align:middle line:84%
I have wonderful
parents, so it's not

00:56:24.702 --> 00:56:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that only my grandmother
took care of me,

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.920 align:middle line:84%
but she was there in
a big part of my life.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I grew up, I always
spent a lot of time with her.

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest gift
that she gave me

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:45.990 align:middle line:84%
was to help me to
understand health,

00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:48.370 align:middle line:84%
because she liked to
move and do gymnastics.

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:50.430 align:middle line:84%
She gave me the
fifth-year gold needle

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:52.770 align:middle line:90%
from her gymnastics class.

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:59.220 align:middle line:84%
She gave me her father's, so
my great-grandfather's, trophy

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.140 align:middle line:84%
from being the best
athlete in the city.

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:02.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big horn, but silver.

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I have that like a trophy, of
a family heritage of health

00:57:07.470 --> 00:57:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and doing something
good in society.

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:14.550 align:middle line:90%
And eating healthy.

00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:16.380 align:middle line:90%
She did all the food, from--

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.820 align:middle line:90%
we went hunting.

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.940 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather was a big
hunter, so we went hunting.

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.160 align:middle line:90%
We would go fishing.

00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.480 align:middle line:90%
So eating from nature.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.650 align:middle line:90%
So clean food.

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Actually cooking and making food
from real food, from animals.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.060 align:middle line:90%


00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:34.337 align:middle line:90%
Being thankful.

00:57:34.337 --> 00:57:35.670 align:middle line:90%
She always told me, be thankful.

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:37.980 align:middle line:90%
She taught me prayers.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude, not in
a religious matter,

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:43.700 align:middle line:84%
necessarily, but
just being grateful.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And the most important
thing, probably,

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:49.595 align:middle line:90%
is that she always told me--

00:57:49.595 --> 00:57:50.970 align:middle line:84%
she told me, you
are so talented.

00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:51.770 align:middle line:90%
You are so gifted.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:55.790 align:middle line:84%
You have all these things that
were passed down from her.

00:57:55.790 --> 00:58:00.242 align:middle line:84%
(VOICE BREAKING) You
know, you're not your--

00:58:00.242 --> 00:58:02.200 align:middle line:84%
you're just your genes,
basically, in a family.

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.400 align:middle line:84%
You're not-- you know,
it's just given to you.

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.200 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:12.650 align:middle line:90%


00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:14.086 align:middle line:90%
>> She believed in you.

00:58:14.086 --> 00:58:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Did that help you
believe in yourself?

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:20.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think the biggest gift
was the fact that she taught me

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that you have all
these gifts, but you're

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:30.370 align:middle line:90%
obliged to help other people.

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:34.070 align:middle line:84%
When it's easy for
you in life, it's

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:35.510 align:middle line:90%
your duty to help other people.

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:41.872 align:middle line:90%


00:58:41.872 --> 00:58:43.330 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
help and support,

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:45.580 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult to
help other people.

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.187 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, she helped me a lot.

00:58:47.187 --> 00:58:50.109 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:54.990 align:middle line:90%


00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, who am I to talk
about lasting fulfillment?

00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm like just a spring
chicken in the middle of life,

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.442 align:middle line:90%
in the stream of life.

00:59:02.442 --> 00:59:03.900 align:middle line:84%
You probably have
to ask some older

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:08.121 align:middle line:90%
people or some wise people.

00:59:08.121 --> 00:59:09.496 align:middle line:84%
>> What did your
[INAUDIBLE] say?

00:59:09.496 --> 00:59:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> My grandmother always told
me that being thankful is one

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:14.950 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest part
of becoming old.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
thankfulness does

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:20.950 align:middle line:84%
is that it makes you
accept things as they are.

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And you don't hold grudges.

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:23.110 align:middle line:90%
You're not negative.

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:25.750 align:middle line:84%
You come from a
positive mindset.

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that you're also good
to yourself on all levels.

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Eating more healthy.

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Breathing more consciously.

00:59:33.570 --> 00:59:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Thinking more positively.

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Surrounding yourself
with nice people,

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:42.450 align:middle line:84%
and saying no to
negative people.

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Not letting that
influence your life.

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Not letting that occupy
space in your mind.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.190 align:middle line:90%


00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:55.495 align:middle line:84%
Not letting disbelief take
you away from your dreams,

00:59:55.495 --> 00:59:57.070 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:59:57.070 --> 01:00:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So gratitude, thankfulness,
and then of course movement.

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Gymnastics.

01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:04.640 align:middle line:90%
Walking.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Simple things, but just
taking care of your body.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.160 align:middle line:90%


01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is timeless wisdom,
even from the Greeks.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:17.770 align:middle line:90%


01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
A healthy body and
a healthy mind.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
It's all connected and we
need to take care of both.

01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the disconnect
that maybe in modern times,

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:28.455 align:middle line:84%
that we are not so connected
to the mind and especially not

01:00:28.455 --> 01:00:31.650 align:middle line:90%
to the spiritual aspects.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's about being passionate
about being given, and fighting

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:48.047 align:middle line:84%
for, your possibility
of living your dreams.

01:00:48.047 --> 01:00:49.130 align:middle line:90%
So I always loved animals.

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to grow up
to become a biologist.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I was lucky that I was born
in a country where education

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
is free, and I was lucky
that my grandmother helped me

01:00:57.830 --> 01:00:59.190 align:middle line:90%
with my studies, and my mother.

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it's about environment,
and it's about being thankful

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and being a dreamer.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we start to
come back to our bodies, that's

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:19.660 align:middle line:90%
the first step.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Then we start to understand
how we can affect the heart,

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and then we understand love
on a deeper perspective.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Because your heart shines
this energy around you.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.600 align:middle line:90%
We have these auras.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
All tradition have
an aura, whether it's

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Jesus with the halo,
whether it's the Buddha,

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
we always have
something above here.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So something, an
energy, around us.

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.960 align:middle line:90%
So a charisma or aura.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.920 align:middle line:84%
There are many names,
but this energy

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that transcends the
body, the limitations

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:51.370 align:middle line:90%
of our physical body.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's so simple to
me, even though I'm

01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:59.650 align:middle line:84%
a scientist, that there
is so much more to life.

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I could
challenge any scientist

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.970 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, so are you married?

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.183 align:middle line:84%
If it's a man, if he's married
to a woman, I would say,

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:09.100 align:middle line:90%
do you love your wife?

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.930 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Show me the formula.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I want to see the
formula for love.

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:14.970 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:16.000 align:middle line:90%
There is no formula.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to see the proof.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to see the
measurements for love.

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And he would probably
say, uh, yeah,

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't have those
measurements yet.

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:29.290 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do those lab studies.

01:02:29.290 --> 01:02:33.430 align:middle line:84%
My point being that there are so
many energies and so much power

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and so much connection
on many levels

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
that are just
difficult to measure.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:42.290 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean that
they're not existing.

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And love, of course--

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:45.860 align:middle line:84%
everything is about
love-- to yourself,

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
towards animals, towards
nature, being kind-natured.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And from breathwork
and from meditation,

01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
you have that direct
connection with your heart.

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:58.635 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of
the strongest things I've

01:02:58.635 --> 01:03:00.838 align:middle line:84%
learned when I started
freediving, is that when you

01:03:00.838 --> 01:03:02.630 align:middle line:84%
hold your breath, there
is something called

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:03.870 align:middle line:90%
the mammalian dive response.

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's a reflex
all people have.

01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not just freedivers,
but freedivers

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:10.580 align:middle line:90%
learn to tap into this reflex.

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is the
heart rate lowers quickly,

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.220 align:middle line:84%
the mind settles, and the
body kind of shuts down,

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.732 align:middle line:90%
so you go into idle.

01:03:18.732 --> 01:03:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Wooo.

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's where there's time
for reflection for bigger

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
things and for
bigger performances,

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
because the body can do things
that under normal circumstances

01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:33.080 align:middle line:90%
it cannot do.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I try is to bring
those reflexes on the forefront

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.435 align:middle line:84%
to people and say, hey,
if you breathe and breathe

01:03:40.435 --> 01:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
into your heart,
you can actually

01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:42.590 align:middle line:90%
control your heart rate.

01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Really?

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Look at your little device.

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a little variable
today on a smartphone.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.887 align:middle line:90%
And then you can see it.

01:03:49.887 --> 01:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
with breath holding.

01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:54.805 align:middle line:90%
Just hold your breath.

01:03:54.805 --> 01:03:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, the heart
starts to beat more slowly--

01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.830 align:middle line:90%
it's called bradycardia--

01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
because the body
wants to save oxygen.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So we have all these
wonderful things.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I think our body, it's
the most amazing thing.

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:07.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, combined
with the mind.

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And with the breath,
we have direct access

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.440 align:middle line:90%
to all our organs.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
That's also one of
the secrets of yoga.

01:04:12.450 --> 01:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
You can tap into the
parasympathetic nervous system.

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, you can
go into your heart.

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
You can travel-- not just
visualize your travel,

01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
but you can literally travel
from the breath into the nerve

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and connect with that
wire into your heart.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And when I hold my
breath for a long time,

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I change the way the
heart is beating.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Not just the pulse.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a primitive,
scientific way

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the
heart-- the pulse.

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Much more important is the
heart rate variability.

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So how is the change
of beats in the heart?

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:43.100 align:middle line:90%
And even more importantly--

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I talked with an
Italian heart surgeon.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.615 align:middle line:90%
He's a freediver.

01:04:48.615 --> 01:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you tell
people what you tell me,

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
people will tell
you you're crazy.

01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when I hold my
breath for a long time,

01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:56.003 align:middle line:90%
I have a dialogue with my heart.

01:04:56.003 --> 01:04:58.660 align:middle line:90%


01:04:58.660 --> 01:04:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't demand.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
I just kindly ask,
could you, just

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
for a few minutes, 20 minutes
maybe, beat a little bit more

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:09.180 align:middle line:90%
softly?

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Could you just relax completely?

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that
shift in the heart.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It opens up and
it becomes softer.

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And from going from
[FAST PUFFS],, [FAST PUFFS],,

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:28.412 align:middle line:84%
[FAST PUFFS],, it goes to
[SLOW PUFFS],, [SLOW PUFFS],,

01:05:28.412 --> 01:05:31.310 align:middle line:90%
[SLOW PUFFS].

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:33.590 align:middle line:84%
That saves oxygen.
It saves brainpower.

01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Saves basically
everything in your energy

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
so you can hold
your breath longer.

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that
in all things in life.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So I try to bring the
breath holding part in,

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.410 align:middle line:84%
which in pranayama is
also very important,

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
but it's forgotten in
normal, modern "yoga."

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So I try to bring both
sides of the coin to people

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and give them choices
to actually use this

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.570 align:middle line:90%
in an everyday life situation.

01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:59.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:04.340 align:middle line:90%


01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.650 align:middle line:84%
The most wonderful
thing about breathing

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:10.040 align:middle line:90%
is that it's easy to access.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
People breathe 25,000,
30,000 times each day,

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and probably breathe about
70% of their maximal capacity.

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
That is a rough estimate
that I just give you.

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if you could move
that towards 80, 90, 95, 100?

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Then every breath would
give you more energy.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:32.987 align:middle line:84%
You would be more
resistant to stress,

01:06:32.987 --> 01:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
so you would have
stronger resilience.

01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.487 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you'd perform
better as an athlete,

01:06:36.487 --> 01:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
or as a father, mother,
friend, a business owner,

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.350 align:middle line:90%
but you would also live longer.

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So in India, they don't
measure life in time.

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:49.130 align:middle line:90%
They measure in breath.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have about one
billion breath in a lifetime,

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.800 align:middle line:90%
if you do the math.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
10 million breath a
year times 100 years.

01:06:57.770 --> 01:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
If you live that long,
that's a billion breath.

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So what I hope to tell
people, or my message,

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.457 align:middle line:90%
is to just move that barrier--

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
which is everything
that we've talked about,

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:11.870 align:middle line:90%
moving to the next level--

01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:17.430 align:middle line:84%
your cells, your mind, what you
eat, people you hang out with--

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and move that breathing
and the conscious breathing

01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
up towards 80%, 90%, 100%
so every breath you take

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.180 align:middle line:84%
is living your life
to the fullest.

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that your cells
are working optimally.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.620 align:middle line:90%
You're digesting much better.

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
You're not keeping and
holding on to waste products.

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:39.240 align:middle line:84%
You can also lose weight
easier because you're not

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.890 align:middle line:90%
in a panic mode.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
You're more open and
loving towards yourself.

01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And breathing, because it's
soft, also softens your mind

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.710 align:middle line:90%
and it softens your body.

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing for people
to do if they've never

01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:58.650 align:middle line:84%
done breathwork is just
to be, first of all,

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.240 align:middle line:90%
conscious about breathing.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Second of all, use the nose
because you want that nitrogen

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
oxide-- you want that extra
molecule that people have--

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
to actually make more
oxygen jump into your lungs

01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
because the alveoli, the blood
vascular system in the lungs,

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
open more when you
breathe with your nose.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:16.979 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
do a slow exhale,

01:08:16.979 --> 01:08:19.029 align:middle line:90%
they tap into the vagus nerve.

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So when people breathe what
I call 1, 2 breathing--

01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:27.390 align:middle line:90%
the ratio of 1 to 2--

01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:32.160 align:middle line:84%
so 1 to 2 is just one inhalation
is, for example, four seconds.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.146 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

01:08:34.146 --> 01:08:35.479 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a slight pause.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:36.762 align:middle line:90%
This is very important.

01:08:36.762 --> 01:08:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an
exhale for 8 seconds,

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.796 align:middle line:90%
so the double amount of time.

01:08:40.796 --> 01:08:41.782 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES]

01:08:41.782 --> 01:08:47.679 align:middle line:90%


01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:48.479 align:middle line:90%
And a pause again.

01:08:48.479 --> 01:08:50.979 align:middle line:84%
And then your body tells you
to breathe and you start again.

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:52.629 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And the breathing comes from
the belly, from the diaphragm.

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
You're just completely
relaxing the shoulders.

01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:02.319 align:middle line:84%
Your lower jaw is dropping
down a little bit.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Your tongue falls to the bottom
of the floor of the mouth.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.279 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes and your
forehead relax.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And that translate
quickly into your brain.

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:12.868 align:middle line:90%
And then you exhale again.

01:09:12.868 --> 01:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES] So 1, 2 breathing,
conscious breathing,

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.015 align:middle line:84%
it's the best way to conquer
any stressful situation in life.

01:09:25.015 --> 01:09:28.417 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:32.319 align:middle line:90%


01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the simple reason for
discovering your purpose

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:38.939 align:middle line:84%
is of course to leave a legacy,
to leave something behind when

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:40.470 align:middle line:90%
you go on your next journey.

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So if people have
not found that yet

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
or they don't know
what it is, they

01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
should keep searching, because
it would be a waste of life

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
if you're not contributing to
society and people around you--

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:57.960 align:middle line:84%
people that you love, but also
people further down the road.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And for me, people often think
that I'm super structured

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and, oh, you're planning
all these things.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely a disaster
in planning and knowing

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.200 align:middle line:90%
where to go.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell,
especially young people,

01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:23.780 align:middle line:84%
when I give presentations
or lectures,

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.900 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter if you
don't know where you're going.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.520 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing is that you

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.790 align:middle line:90%
know what you don't want to do.

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.070 align:middle line:90%
That's my honest opinion.

01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
If you are doing
something you don't like,

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:38.910 align:middle line:84%
something you don't
love, stop it.

01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Why would you keep doing it?

01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But this is also like a
catch-22, tricky situation.

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're a solo mom
with three kids and having

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
problems with your income and
just fighting to get everyday

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:57.660 align:middle line:84%
life balancing, it's not the
first thing you wake up-- like,

01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:00.360 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, I have to help all
these people in the world today

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.160 align:middle line:90%
and--

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.810 align:middle line:84%
it would be a wonderful thought,
but you're just right here

01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:08.530 align:middle line:90%
in this difficult situation.

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.290 align:middle line:84%
That will change,
hopefully, for anyone

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.105 align:middle line:84%
in any part of the
world with time.

01:11:13.105 --> 01:11:16.620 align:middle line:90%


01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:21.358 align:middle line:84%
But for me, it's been a
really wandering road.

01:11:21.358 --> 01:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like when I speak.

01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I speak about something and I
go in 5 different directions,

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.745 align:middle line:90%
but I always come back.

01:11:26.745 --> 01:11:28.740 align:middle line:90%
So that is my strength.

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that is the
strength people should find,

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:37.470 align:middle line:84%
is this stubbornness,
this continuity.

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Just keep going, keep going,
and having the beliefs

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:43.200 align:middle line:90%
that everything will be OK.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
So I always loved animal.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.040 align:middle line:90%
I became a biologist.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.550 align:middle line:90%
There was no other way.

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:49.350 align:middle line:90%
Again, I was lucky.

01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:51.267 align:middle line:84%
I was born in a country
I could get education.

01:11:51.267 --> 01:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I had wonderful
support in my family.

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:56.390 align:middle line:84%
But I became a biologist because
I love nature and animals.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It's still the thing I
love the most in the world,

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.400 align:middle line:84%
is watching animals; learn
about paleontology-- where

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
did we come from; learning
about how they communicate

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.160 align:middle line:84%
because that translates to
so many other things in life.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Then I studied medicine.

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I always had the swimming
and the freediving,

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.920 align:middle line:84%
but that became
more professional.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Then I became ill
when I was a child.

01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:17.450 align:middle line:90%
I had severe asthma.

01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And that subconsciously
probably led

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
me to reflect more on
breathing and the importance

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:23.580 align:middle line:90%
of proper breathing.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And then in science, and
my journeys to India,

01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:30.300 align:middle line:90%
and my peak performance sport--

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.240 align:middle line:90%
so the freediving records--

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:36.850 align:middle line:84%
brought that breath holding
aspect into the completeness

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:37.650 align:middle line:90%
of breathwork.

01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I created this
framework of Breatheology.

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
something missing.

01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:43.560 align:middle line:84%
If you are just
breathing, breathing

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.930 align:middle line:90%
is actually stressful.

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Taking the breath is stressful.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%
The exhale is what relaxes you.

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people
the key to relaxation

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.970 align:middle line:90%
is in the exhalation.

01:12:54.970 --> 01:13:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think for people to not
do what they were meant to do,

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:04.322 align:middle line:84%
or this greater purpose,
is a waste of life.

01:13:04.322 --> 01:13:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And where do you find
that purpose, then?

01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:07.738 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's helping
the world to breathe

01:13:07.738 --> 01:13:09.240 align:middle line:90%
better, one breath at a time.

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.730 align:middle line:84%
When you find that
purpose, you against

01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
start to visualize and dream
and look for people that

01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:16.830 align:middle line:90%
can help you and support you.

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And you move forward.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And you move five
steps backwards.

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.610 align:middle line:90%
And then again, you push.

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's this ongoing journey.

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:31.548 align:middle line:84%
And then when you start to see
the results and the change,

01:13:31.548 --> 01:13:32.840 align:middle line:90%
that is the biggest fulfilling.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.400 align:middle line:90%
So that is fulfillment in life.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:40.010 align:middle line:84%
That is being gifted with
all these wonderful stories

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:42.350 align:middle line:84%
of people's lives
you have changed,

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:47.640 align:middle line:84%
from a simple thing as breathing
or from changing the mindset.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I have no doubt
that breathing

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:54.020 align:middle line:84%
will be the next revolution,
everything-- in science,

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:59.250 align:middle line:84%
in medicine, in prevention, in
treatment, and rehabilitation.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:14:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So in all aspects of
the health care system,

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
breathing will be
a big, big part.

01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:07.875 align:middle line:84%
And I also think for
children and schools-- that's

01:14:07.875 --> 01:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
one of my big
missions, as well--

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.792 align:middle line:84%
to get to yoga,
breathing, meditation

01:14:10.792 --> 01:14:14.530 align:middle line:84%
into every single
school of the world.

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:18.443 align:middle line:84%
Because if you as a child
learn to breathe consciously,

01:14:18.443 --> 01:14:20.110 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have
all these challenges

01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're facing now, and you
don't have all those issues

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:28.000 align:middle line:84%
with stress and illness to
this same extreme degree

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
as we're seeing
now in the world.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is creating good
habits and creating a stronger

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.850 align:middle line:84%
relationship with
yourself and nature.

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think the easiest way to
find your purpose is actually

01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:46.440 align:middle line:84%
to tune into your true nature,
because you have it in you.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- I don't know
where it comes from.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't say it's in your genes,
but it's probably passed down

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:55.790 align:middle line:90%
from generations to you.

01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Different skills,
different things

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that were important to
survive, different tactics,

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:06.490 align:middle line:84%
different ways of thinking,
all this is passed down to you.

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And then of course
there's the environment

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and the way you train your mind
and take care of your body.

01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So whether you have found
your purpose or not,

01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:15.610 align:middle line:90%
you should keep searching.

01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:19.223 align:middle line:84%
Whether you have found
your purpose in life or not

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:20.140 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really matter.

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
You should hopefully find
it at some point, the sooner

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the better, so you can serve and
help other people around you.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And you get a tremendous amount
of love and thankfulness back.

01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is what will bring
fulfillment in your life.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So for me, starting as
a child with asthma,

01:15:40.690 --> 01:15:44.532 align:middle line:84%
becoming a scientist, doing
my PhD degree in medicine,

01:15:44.532 --> 01:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
moving into more
professional freediving,

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.590 align:middle line:90%
setting world records--

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Guinness World Records--
breaking these limiting beliefs

01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:53.873 align:middle line:84%
and showing the world
that in my world,

01:15:53.873 --> 01:15:56.040 align:middle line:84%
breath holding for more
than 20 minutes is possible,

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.630 align:middle line:90%
diving under ice is possible--

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
all those things
have meant nothing

01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:06.800 align:middle line:84%
if I didn't succeed
in translating

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.730 align:middle line:84%
all that into something that
brings purpose to other people.

01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:13.910 align:middle line:90%
So for me, it's breathwork.

01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's helping people to
become more aware of breath,

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.760 align:middle line:84%
the power of breath, how
they can cure themselves,

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.660 align:middle line:84%
treat themselves for
stress, different diseases.

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's also bringing in the
aspect of breath holding--

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:28.640 align:middle line:90%
so pausing.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's also a metaphor
for just taking a break.

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:33.760 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be OK.

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine
the breathing--

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.720 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the life
force-- and the breath

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
holding-- the pause, the
giving in, the letting go,

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
the acceptance of
death, basically--

01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and you bring
those two together,

01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:47.710 align:middle line:90%
you have balance in life.

01:16:47.710 --> 01:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So for me, purpose
is the fulfillment

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of helping millions
of other people--

01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:54.790 align:middle line:90%
which I'm already doing now--

01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
discover the unlimited
power of breathwork.

01:16:58.150 --> 01:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that's
very important

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
purpose in life

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.970 align:middle line:84%
is that you should always
believe in yourself.

01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that your
dream is too small,

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.020 align:middle line:90%
that it's not important.

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:12.412 align:middle line:84%
Because what I've seen with all
the wonderful, talented, loving

01:17:12.412 --> 01:17:13.870 align:middle line:84%
people I've met
around the world is

01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:18.568 align:middle line:84%
that what holds people
back-- of course

01:17:18.568 --> 01:17:20.610 align:middle line:84%
it's a limiting belief
that they're not important

01:17:20.610 --> 01:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
or their hobby, their passion,
is not important enough.

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you start to look
at the bigger picture--

01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:28.657 align:middle line:90%
let's take my example.

01:17:28.657 --> 01:17:29.990 align:middle line:90%
So I help people breathe better.

01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:32.258 align:middle line:84%
OK, he was breathing
a little bit better.

01:17:32.258 --> 01:17:34.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I help one person
to breathe better--

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
it could be from a traumatic
event, could be from stress,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.260 align:middle line:84%
could be from PTSD, it
could be from illness--

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:43.850 align:middle line:90%
what happens then?

01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:45.660 align:middle line:84%
That whole family
starts to heal.

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:48.710 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
The kid has an easier
time at school,

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.370 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the homework,
getting better grades,

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.245 align:middle line:90%
getting an education.

01:17:53.245 --> 01:17:54.710 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:56.810 align:middle line:84%
The whole neighborhood
starts to--

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:58.910 align:middle line:90%
they have a party at summer.

01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Then they can be resourceful
and bring some food.

01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:02.670 align:middle line:90%
What happens then?

01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:04.880 align:middle line:90%
It spreads out of the community.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm trying to say is
that when you find your purpose

01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:13.520 align:middle line:84%
in life, stick with that
and believe in yourself,

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.370 align:middle line:84%
because you need to believe so
much in yourself that you also

01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:17.960 align:middle line:90%
convince other people.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And then good
things will happen.

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's a rippling
effect, I'm talking about,

01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.960 align:middle line:90%
from your passion.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that translate--
passion, I think,

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
is one of the strongest
driving force in life.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Passion is also love.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Passion is giving love
to one area in your life,

01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:39.680 align:middle line:84%
whether it's arts or
nature or architecture--

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.460 align:middle line:84%
anything in life that you
spend your precious time on.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is why passion
is so powerful, because it

01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:51.950 align:middle line:84%
translates, it travels through
the creation of your work

01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:55.340 align:middle line:90%
to other people on many levels.

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.880 align:middle line:90%
And art is a good example.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
The beauty-- and
sport, of course, also.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.170 align:middle line:90%
The peak performance.

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe people don't
understand it,

01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
but there is a message that
travels and reaches them.

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you see
the pain in athletes

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
or you see the victory,
you identify yourself

01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
in that, but maybe in
your life struggle, maybe

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.172 align:middle line:90%
your financial situation.

01:19:18.172 --> 01:19:19.130 align:middle line:90%
So you're not a runner.

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, you didn't run
a marathon, but you

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.960 align:middle line:84%
have been working nine
to five for 12 years,

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.330 align:middle line:84%
supporting three kids,
so that's a marathon.

01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So I think when people stick
to what they love and find

01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:36.070 align:middle line:84%
that purpose, it will
help the world change.

01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:39.120 align:middle line:90%
