00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I like to say my rebirth as
an ultra marathoner started--

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.900 align:middle line:90%
it was fueled by bad tequila.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I was in a nightclub
on my 30th birthday

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
doing what we do on
our 30th birthday.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I was getting drunk
with my buddies.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And 11 o'clock at night,
I had a midlife crisis,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.729 align:middle line:90%
an epiphany if you will.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.098 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't like the
course my life is going down,

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
change it right now.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to become
a runner again.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.775 align:middle line:84%
I used to love to
run when I was a kid,

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
but I hadn't run
in over a decade.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.180 align:middle line:90%
So I left the nightclub.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I walked out of the bar, 11
o'clock at night, and said,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm running 30 miles right now.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Three sheets to the
wind, I just took off,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.542 align:middle line:84%
started running south
from San Francisco.

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
I knew if I made it
to a town called Half

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Moon Bay, that
was 30 miles away.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And about 15 miles
into it, I sobered up

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, what
the hell am I doing?

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:90%
This is wrong.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.993 align:middle line:90%
This is absurd.

00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But it just felt
right, so I kept going.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.985 align:middle line:84%
And that night forever changed
the direction of my life.

00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:11.925 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:18.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm a prolific
runner, and I love

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
running in extreme
conditions as well as

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.700 align:middle line:90%
running extreme distances.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So I've run across Death
Valley in the middle of summer,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
where it's over 130
degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I've run a marathon
to the South Pole.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:84%
I've run across the Gobi,
across the Atacama Desert.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I've run on all seven
continents twice now.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So I've seen just about every
piece of Earth you could see.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I ran across Haiti
earlier this year.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Just a couple months ago, I ran
across the ancient Silk Road,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.340 align:middle line:84%
from Uzbekistan to Kyrgyzstan
to Kazakhstan-- so wild stretch

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:90%
of the Silk Road.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.600 align:middle line:90%
So I ran--

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to run a marathon
every state of the union.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And my kids only had 50
days off for summer break,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
so I had to do
them repetitively.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, 50 marathons, 50
states, 50 consecutive days.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we had a
big converted bus.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:90%
And my kids traveled with me.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
My mom is a retired
schoolteacher,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
so she road schooled the kids
as we were driving around.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And we drove from
state to state.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And when we got to the west
coast, I flew to Hawaii.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:90%
From Hawaii, flew to Alaska.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
From Alaska, flew to Seattle,
and then got back in the bus.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I pretty much followed
the prescription for happiness.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
We're told if we go to good
college, get a good degree--

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.660 align:middle line:90%
I went to graduate school.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:90%
I got a business degree, an MBA.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I had a cushy corporate
job with all the perks.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I had stock options,
company car.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:84%
These things are supposed
to bring you happiness.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.245 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that would
be the case with me,

00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:09.250 align:middle line:90%
and I wasn't happy.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.952 align:middle line:84%
I was young, I was successful,
and I was miserable.

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like being
a business guy.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't who I was.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just saw
that I would either

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.482 align:middle line:84%
pursue a life of
quiet desperation,

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
or I would do what I
really wanted to do,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.603 align:middle line:84%
and that was exploration and
run and just see the world.

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea how I was
going to pay for it all,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.145 align:middle line:84%
but I thought, you know, it
just feels better doing this.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's the impetus
that got me going.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that we've become so
comfortable, we're miserable.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.580 align:middle line:84%
We thought if we were
comfortable, we'd be happy,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.967 align:middle line:90%
and we're over-convenienced.

00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
There's no struggle.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.133 align:middle line:90%
There's no hardship in our life.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes easy.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.858 align:middle line:84%
And I find that I'm never
more fulfilled and more

00:03:55.858 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:84%
alive than when I'm really
struggling, especially

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.520 align:middle line:84%
during a long, really
difficult race.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I like to say there's
magic in misery.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So pursuing a lofty goal
and groveling is magic.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It's unlike anything that
modern day living provides,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.214 align:middle line:84%
any sort of comfort, any
sort of material thing.

00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
They don't bring the same sort
of joy, not the same level

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%
of fulfillment.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%
For me, running and
physical endurance

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is the way I manifest
that striving

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
to be the best that I can be,
to reach my, as the Greeks say,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
the arete, the perfect alignment
of mind, body, and spirit.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So other people can
achieve their bestness

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
through following
their own passion.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Running isn't for everyone.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell
people, if it's basket

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
weaving you love, throw
your heart and your passion

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
into basket weaving, and
you'll make a go of it.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
People are like,
how am I ever going

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:90%
to make a living doing this?

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
You'll figure out
a way if you follow

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:90%
what you are truly happy about.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people,
script your perfect life.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Just take a pen and
a sheet of paper,

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
not a computer, and just
freeform, in one paragraph,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
describe what your day
would look like if you

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:90%
were living the perfect life.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Dream.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.482 align:middle line:90%
Make it outrageous.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:90%
Just what would it look like?

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.565 align:middle line:84%
Some people are surprised
because they think,

00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%
oh, great house right
on the beach, that's

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:90%
what would bring me happiness.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.658 align:middle line:90%
And they start to write this.

00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
They think, God, I'd be
doing charity work in India.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:90%
That would really move my heart.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:90%
So I tell people to do that.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.055 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a blueprint
of where you want to go.

00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Because unless you know
where you want to go,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:90%
you're never going to get there.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's the way I tell people
to find their calling in life.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I think the biggest drawback,
the biggest hurdle to people

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.550 align:middle line:90%
doing what they love is fear.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:90%
They fear the unknown.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:90%
And let's face it, it's scary.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
It was really scary
for me to tell my wife,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to leave my job.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
We had-- I had my
young daughter.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
We had health care.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, we had a
401(k) matching program,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:90%
all these perks, a paycheck.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to walk away
from all these things.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a scary transition.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone is willing
to trust in themselves

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:90%
to that level.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that holds
a lot of people captive.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's too bad, it really is.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Because it's better, I
think, to fail boldly

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:90%
than not to try at all.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I think to identify your fears,
you really need to look inward.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And that requires
quiet reflection,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
which is hard to find
in our modern day.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly bombarded
with noise and distraction.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So I always tell
people, go for a walk.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Or if you like to run,
go for a long run.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And really say, what
is holding me back?

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Where do I want to
go, and why am I

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:90%
not moving in that direction?

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
What are these barriers
that are getting in my way?

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
it is just convenience.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:84%
I think people don't want to
move outside their comfort

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
zone, and that can be a trap.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So for me, running was
very symbolic of life,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.120 align:middle line:84%
because you're forced to move
outside of your comfort zone.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
You're forced to
confront failure.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
You're forced to
see how willing you

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:90%
are to push through adversity.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think
running is a great lesson that

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
transcends the sport of running
into broader life things.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
all interconnected.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And to contribute your utmost
to society, to humanity,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:84%
I think you need
to pursue what it

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:90%
is that's uniquely within you.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.735 align:middle line:84%
And I just think that that is
the best course for humanity.

00:07:59.735 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:84%
If everyone was to do
that, I think the world

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.652 align:middle line:90%
would be a happier place.

00:08:02.652 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I studied food science when
I was in graduate school,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%
so I could expound for a long
time about the food industry.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I think we've gotten
away from the Earth.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I've gone full circle
with my particular diet.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I've self-selected
the foods that

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:84%
seem to give me more energy
versus those that would leave

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:90%
me lethargic and dragging.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I ate only
things that a caveman would

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:84%
have eaten, anything I
can pick from a tree,

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.860 align:middle line:84%
dig from the Earth, catch with
my hands as far as game goes.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So I've gone to foods that
are unprocessed and unrefined.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to look at
less engineering in our food

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
and focus more on how do
we sustain agriculture

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and eating from the land
and better mechanisms

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
for doing that.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.075 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'm
alone in this belief.

00:08:58.075 --> 00:09:00.963 align:middle line:84%
I think that a lot of people
are realizing this as well.

00:09:00.963 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a mentor I
have here in America.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:90%
His name's Jack LaLanne.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:90%
He's a fitness guy.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And he used to say, if man
makes it, don't eat it,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.126 align:middle line:84%
and if it tastes
good, spit it out.

00:09:10.126 --> 00:09:10.926 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Jack.

00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So my diet, if you had
to take a genres of diet,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of a hybrid between
a paleo, a Mediterranean,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:90%
and raw.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
I really don't cook
my food much at all.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, living here
in northern California,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I eat a lot of wild Pacific
salmon, almost sushi grade.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.565 align:middle line:90%
So lot of uncooked, raw foods.

00:09:35.565 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So as an ultra-marathoner
that's run

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.740 align:middle line:84%
across a lot of different
deserts in the world,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:90%
hydration is really important.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've experimented with
just about everything.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
What I've come to is coconut
water, just unsweetened,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:84%
usually raw organic
coconut water.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
drinking coconut water

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:90%
for about the past decade.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of in vogue now.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
You hear a lot about coconut
water brands and such.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't really like coconut
water just day-to-day.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.862 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm in need of
hydration, coconut water

00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
seems to work better
than anything.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So people ask me if I
meditate, and I really don't.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I do yoga, but I do what's
called Bikram Yogra or Bikram

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:90%
Yoga-- hot yoga.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So I do that more just for
stretching, not for any sort

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:90%
of therapeutic value.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Running is my therapy.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
run for that very reason.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I work through so many
problems when I'm running,

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and I get to look inward.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's my quiet time
to think for myself.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:90%
I have no distractions.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I can think whatever I want.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I'm an
author as well, a writer,

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and I do a lot of my
writing while I'm running.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I carry a digital recorder.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I use my iPhone now.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.955 align:middle line:84%
And I just dictate a lot
of passages as I'm running.

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Then, when I'm on flights
across the country,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.093 align:middle line:90%
I just type up my notes.

00:11:06.093 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I've
written a lot of my books.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.980 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
running, you're either

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.897 align:middle line:84%
super bored-- which it happens
a lot, which I think is fine.

00:11:13.897 --> 00:11:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think
it's fine for people

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
to be bored because
I don't think

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:84%
people spend enough time
being bored these days.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I think everyone's
like, we can't be bored.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:90%
This is bad.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's change it.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:90%
I think boredom is--

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.590 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of the
yin and the yang.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to balance the
chaos in most of our lives.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:36.197 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.197 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:90%
People do think I'm crazy.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.072 align:middle line:84%
But it's amazing when
I run down the street

00:11:39.072 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:90%
how many people recognize me.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:90%
And they-- I don't know.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Running, it's bizarre
how it inspires people,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.780 align:middle line:90%
because it's such a simple act.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But when I run marathons--
like I'm running New York City

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:90%
Marathon in a couple of weeks.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
millions of spectators,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:90%
and they're so happy.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And they're not running.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.397 align:middle line:90%
You're just like, why?

00:11:56.397 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
You just wonder, why are these
people so fired up and inspired

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:90%
watching someone half dead?

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:90%
But there's something that--

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.180 align:middle line:84%
there's some human
thing, there's some bond.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.290 align:middle line:84%
When you see someone
suffering, you immediately

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:90%
unite with them somehow.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's deep, and I think
we really understand it.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But I think it goes beyond
just cheering someone

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:90%
to the finish line.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.290 align:middle line:84%
With running, I think
visualization, as far

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%
as your craft, is a
little bit less important.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of athletes that
visualize crossing the finish

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
line, and I think that
can be a powerful impetus

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:90%
to get you going.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
more the seeds that

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:90%
are planted when you're young.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.610 align:middle line:84%
There's always some inflection
point where you see something.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Novak had an early
experience that changed him.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Something sparked
in his personality

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.310 align:middle line:84%
when he saw this gentleman
win Wimbledon on television.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Something about it-- it
could have been anything.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:90%
He could have just--

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:90%
the sweat coming off his head.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Just something, some trigger
in this little boy got ignited,

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:90%
and it turned into--

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:90%
wow-- an incredible fire.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So with me, I just remember
when I was a little boy--

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm Greek, 100% Greek-- going
to these Greek festivals

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.335 align:middle line:84%
for Easter-- and
Easter is a big party,

00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
a big celebration
in Greek tradition--

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and watching these
men, these 70-,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
these 80-year-old men that
would dance non-stop all day.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:84%
They'd drink ouzo and they'd
get back out on the dance floor.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And something about
their endurance--

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.870 align:middle line:84%
they just all day
long were dancing.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, how do
they have that kind of stamina?

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:84%
This idea of just going all day
with anything stuck with me,

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and it just manifested
in running, I think.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:90%
We change over time.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
What's important to me now
was probably not so important

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:90%
when I was a teenager.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
learning new skills

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and taking on new
challenges is something

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:90%
that really ignites a passion.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So I always encourage people,
try something different.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.678 align:middle line:84%
And running-- again,
I'm going to go back

00:14:10.678 --> 00:14:12.357 align:middle line:84%
to writing because
it's so symbolic.

00:14:12.357 --> 00:14:13.440 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't run.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:90%
And I say, sign up for a 5K.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Make a goal of running a 5K.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.730 align:middle line:90%
It's approachable.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not as difficult as
learning a new language

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.093 align:middle line:84%
It's more a discipline sort
of thing, a mental discipline.

00:14:25.093 --> 00:14:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But it'll break down
barriers, and it'll

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
get you to look at
yourself and to analyze

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.803 align:middle line:90%
and to think differently.

00:14:32.803 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So I get asked a lot, like,
who are your inspirations?

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I look to everyday
people that inspire me.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have
heroes, and these people

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.362 align:middle line:90%
are larger than life.

00:14:48.362 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
You don't really know what
their personality is like.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Think about Steve
Jobs, for instance.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I kind of idolized the guy.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, the more I
learned about who he really

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
was, I thought, there's
some qualities there

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not so crazy about.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
But my wife is my hero,
because I know her intimately,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:90%
and she's just got a good soul.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:84%
She is-- she's beautiful,
just naturally.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And you see the flaws
in someone when you

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:90%
live with them for 30 years.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:90%
My dad is a great hero of mine.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And for better or
for worse, he's

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:90%
just always been there for me.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Even when I didn't want him
there for me, he was there.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And he's always got my back, and
I really admire him for that.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's the everyday hero
that really inspires me.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
The "why do you run" is a
complex, nuanced question.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Why does anyone run?

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:90%
It hurts.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
After you're done, it
makes you feel good,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.750 align:middle line:84%
but the act itself, you
don't want to do it.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:90%
It's painful.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Why are you drawn to it?

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Why do you spend countless
hours on a trail by yourself?

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is
certainly escapism.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:90%
I've got to be honest.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm a responsible
father and husband.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But these are
pressures that I'm not

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:16.830 align:middle line:84%
sure we're engineered
as a species to endure.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:90%
It's hard for me.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I know I've got three people
that depend on me to make

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:90%
a living, to earn money.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I don't
want that burden.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And running, to me,
it provides a release

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
where I can just be free, it's
just my shoes and a trail.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I would say I'm a
spiritual person.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a religious
person, per se.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
ancient Greek quotes

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:90%
that I reflect on a lot.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
There's one by a guy
named Aeschylus who said,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:84%
today is the tomorrow you
worried about yesterday.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:90%
So that speaks to stress.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And my dad always used to say,
it's not how many times you

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.589 align:middle line:84%
get knocked down
that matters, it's

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:90%
how many times you get back up.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.850 align:middle line:90%
So I really like that one too.

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:90%
