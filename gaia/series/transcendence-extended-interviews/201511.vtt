00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:07.648 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:09.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters,"

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.920 align:middle line:10%
and welcome to this special
interview with Shelly Lefkoe.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.050 align:middle line:10%
Shelly is an established voice
in the conscious parenting

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.950 align:middle line:10%
movement and also in helping us
understand how our beliefs are

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:10%
like these invisible
rails guiding our lives

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:10%
and what we can do
to identify them

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:10%
as either limiting or
positive and shift them

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
so that we can live a
more happy, abundant,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:10%
and more conscious life.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:90%
Shelly, hello.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:90%
My God, that was perfectly said.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.828 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I never know how
it's going to come out.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that was good.

00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:90%
You nailed it.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So your foray into
becoming aware of how

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.510 align:middle line:84%
a child gets conditioned
was obviously

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:90%
born out of experience.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:10%
How did that happen for you?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:10%
>> My husband created--

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:10%
my husband and I
created a process

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.700 align:middle line:10%
that quickly and permanently--

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:10%
that helps people quickly and
permanently eliminate beliefs.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And they come to us with
problems, from procrastination

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.870 align:middle line:84%
to depression to
I can't stand up

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
for myself to fear of public
speaking, any range of things.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And we uncover the beliefs
that are causing the problems.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you eliminate the
beliefs, which we do,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:90%
you can eliminate the problems.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me, how did this--
how did you come about this

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:90%
type of work?

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Was there a personal experience
that sort of drove you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.015 align:middle line:84%
to becoming aware of how
powerful these beliefs are

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:90%
in our lives and in parenting?

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, besides being a
parent of two girls,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
it really came out of
my work with people.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So 30 years ago, my
husband created a process

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:84%
that helps people get rid
of the problems, issues

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that they have, whether it's
procrastination, depression,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:84%
not being able to stand up for
yourself, relationship issues,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:90%
fear of public speaking.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Underlying all of those
issues are these beliefs.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:84%
And when you
eliminate the beliefs,

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:90%
the issues literally disappear.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So I started
working with people,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and when we started
tracking these beliefs back

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
to parenting, particularly
self-esteem beliefs, beliefs

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
about money,
beliefs about life--

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and by the word "belief,"
I want to say what

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean when I use that word.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So a belief is something--
it's a statement about reality

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:90%
that you believe is the truth.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's just what a belief is.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I believe people
can't be trusted,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.960 align:middle line:84%
or I believe people
are good at heart.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.730 align:middle line:90%
Those are beliefs.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So when we looked for the
source of the beliefs,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:84%
it went back to early
stages of parenting.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And it suddenly became
apparent to me--

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
a parent, [LAUGHS]---- that
if children were criticized

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
heavily, they would conclude,
I'm not good enough.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
If they weren't given love and
affection, they would conclude,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess I'm
not worth loving.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:84%
If they were ignored or
weren't given enough attention,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
they would conclude,
I'm not important.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I started realizing,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.083 align:middle line:84%
when I ask parents, James,
when your child comes home--

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, when you
come home at the end

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
of the day, what does your
child do when they see you?

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in every
country around the world

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:84%
says the same thing--
they run to me.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I say, and
what do they want?

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:90%
They want three things.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:84%
They want affection,
attention, and acknowledgment.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So if they are not
getting those things,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:84%
what is the one-word
question every child asks?

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.667 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I have a playdate?

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I have dessert?

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Why can't-- you know, why
do you have to go to work?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.198 align:middle line:90%
Why can't we stay home?

00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have to go to school?

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:90%
That's what they ask.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Why am I getting criticized?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I live up to
my parent's expectations?

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Why are my parents always
complaining about money?

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, why-- well,
oh, I guess money

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.030 align:middle line:90%
is scarce and hard to get.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're watching, we're
seeing these things unveil.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just sitting
and listening to this,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:90%
and I just said, oh my god.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
If we could change
the way we parent,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
if we could transform the
way in which we parent,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:90%
we could change the world.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:90%
It was just like, boom.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's how it started.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:84%
If we-- and I agree with
you, first and foremost,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:84%
because I mean, I subscribe
to that same ideology.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But if we delve into
beliefs a little deeper--

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:84%
so you're telling me
that these are mostly

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.670 align:middle line:84%
conditioned at this young
age, this early age.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And then how do
they grow to power

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and control our lives
as we become older?

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
What sort of invisible
power do they have over us?

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that
you say conditioned.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
We work with emotional
conditioning,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.220 align:middle line:84%
which is more of a
Pavlov's dog thing.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So if every time
you hit your child

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
if they do something
wrong or if they talk back

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to you, if they speak up--
every time they speak up,

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:90%
you slap them.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, at some
point, they'll speak up,

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:90%
and they'll go like this.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, that fear starts
to become conditioned.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very
particular about words,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:90%
so I want to just clean that up.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It isn't necessarily that
beliefs get conditioned.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
Here's the thing
about beliefs, why

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:84%
they stay with us for
so long, and then I'll

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.050 align:middle line:90%
explain why they run our lives.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We think that we see our
beliefs in the world.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So beliefs are actually
meaning, right?

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:90%
So we-- something happens.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
We get criticized, and
we give it the meaning,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.990 align:middle line:90%
oh, I guess I'm not good enough.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we get
criticized again,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.092 align:middle line:84%
and we go, yeah,
I'm not good enough.

00:06:27.092 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the third time
we give it the meaning,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:90%
the meaning becomes a belief.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have a belief, OK?

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we look at our
childhoods, and we go--

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.383 align:middle line:84%
and when I ask this question
to people from, again,

00:06:45.383 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:90%
every country in the world--

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:84%
I work on Zoom, so I
have clients in Uganda.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And I say, doesn't it seem like
you saw I'm not good enough?

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And they say,
well, I did see it.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:90%
And I say, really?

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Can you see my scarf?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:90%
They say yes.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Does it have a color,
shape, and location?

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Does I'm not good enough have
a color, shape, and location?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:90%
You can't see I'm not good.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.350 align:middle line:84%
But before we do
that, they say, well,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
but I saw my father
criticize me,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and I saw I didn't get A's in
school, and I saw, you know,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.297 align:middle line:84%
my mother tell me that I
would never amount to anything

00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, all
the wonderful things

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes people
say to children.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:90%
I saw I wasn't important.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
No, you saw your parents
busy working all the time,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:84%
not being at home, not
paying attention to you.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.570 align:middle line:90%
That's seeable.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%
But you cannot see a belief.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's how
beliefs get formed.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.553 align:middle line:90%
It's like Santa Claus.

00:07:48.553 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:90%
Look, there's a Santa Claus.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.180 align:middle line:84%
For eight years, you believe
there is a Santa Claus.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
He's got a red suit
and a white beard.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And one day, you go,
that's my father.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:84%
[MOUTHS EXPLOSION SOUND] You
know, so the belief is gone.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's how they get formed.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Now, why do they run our lives?

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.495 align:middle line:84%
If you believe
that water is hot,

00:08:11.495 --> 00:08:13.120 align:middle line:84%
are you going to put
your finger in it?

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
If you believe I don't
deserve good things--

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to rattle
off a lot of common

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.310 align:middle line:90%
believes people have--

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
are you going to ask
for what you want?

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to buy
yourself a nice new car?

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.980 align:middle line:90%
You just won't.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.922 align:middle line:84%
Now, the beliefs
are unconscious.

00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with people,
that they don't come in and go,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:90%
I have this belief.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Can I get rid of it?

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, nobody cares
about getting rid of beliefs.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
You care about getting
rid of patterns.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You want to get rid of the
fact that you procrastinate.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.210 align:middle line:84%
You want to get rid of the
fact that you don't speak up

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.770 align:middle line:90%
You don't ask for what you want.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:90%
You haven't asked for a raise.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.780 align:middle line:84%
You let people take advantage
of you, whatever it is.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you believe
I'm not important,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.345 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
sit in a meeting,

00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and the little
voice in your head

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is going to go, yeah, no,
they probably know this,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
or nobody cares what
you have to say.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And that voice comes
from your beliefs

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
until you don't speak up.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
If you believe I'm going
to get what I want--

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:90%
here's a really good example.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the most common
beliefs, James, and it's

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:84%
shocking because evidence
does not get rid of beliefs.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I have worked with
five Harvard PhDs who

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:90%
had the belief "I'm stupid."

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, but you have
a PhD from Harvard.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I conned my
way through Harvard.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
The first time I heard
that, I was like, what?

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But when he was a
boy, his father--

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:84%
every time he would say
something that wasn't correct,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
his father would smack them on
the back of the head and say,

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.040 align:middle line:90%
"genius."

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:90%
So again, I saw I was stupid.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I have
evidence to the contrary

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:90%
does not change beliefs.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So there have been many, many,
many, many books written--

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:84%
business books,
particularly-- on the fact

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.335 align:middle line:84%
that mistakes and failures
are learning opportunities.

00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:27.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, Richard Branson
says, if you're not

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.668 align:middle line:84%
making mistakes
and failing, you're

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:30.563 align:middle line:84%
going to be mediocre
because you're

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
doing what you did yesterday,
and you're never going

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:90%
to be successful doing that.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So when people come
to me, and they say,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, I have a fear
of public speaking,

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%
or I have a fear of social--

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:90%
what do you believe?

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And we uncover mistakes
and failures are bad,

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:84%
or if I make a mistake or
fail, I'll be rejected.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And even though they
know it's true--

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
they know that that belief is
not true, it still runs them.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're terrified
to make a mistake

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:84%
or fail when
intellectually they know

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:84%
you can't be innovative without
making mistakes and failing.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:19.035 align:middle line:84%
So these beliefs run us, even
if we know they're not true.

00:11:19.035 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Can we speak a little
bit to, specifically,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people grow up with
parents that might be abusive?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.993 align:middle line:84%
That might be they've had their
own issues in their childhood,

00:11:31.993 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and they're just doing
the best they can

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.070 align:middle line:90%
with the tools they have.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've got narcissistic
personality disorder

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
or something like this,
and then as a child

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:84%
growing up with that experience
or becoming an adult,

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and they start to
realize, well, I'm

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
behaving in a unique way
with my significant other,

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.845 align:middle line:84%
or I'm doing this-- is
that how people identify

00:11:52.845 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
their beliefs because
of the way that they're

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
behaving in the world, and
that it's holding them back

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:90%
from something?

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I would say most people
don't identify their beliefs.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Most people aren't thinking
in terms of beliefs.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people talk
about legacy, and you know,

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.290 align:middle line:90%
we do what we see.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not negating that, but
it's how these beliefs, again,

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:84%
get formed is if you see one
of your parents screaming

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:31.050 align:middle line:84%
at the other one, you
may conclude, ah, the way

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to get what you
want is to scream,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
to control and dominate and
have something like that.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So now, you find
yourself doing that.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you're
conscious enough to say,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
this is a problem,
this is not working,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
this is something
I have to change,

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.910 align:middle line:90%
then you seek out the help.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And some people
do primal scream,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and some people do therapy, and
people do all kinds of things.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:84%
In my experience, you learn
how to cope with these issues,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.520 align:middle line:84%
and some modalities
help you change them.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But in my work, I'm
the one who helps

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
the person say, what must
you believe to scream

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:90%
at somebody that you love?

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And you said something that
I really want to illuminate.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Most people do
the best they can.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Parents want the
best for their kids.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:90%
They love their kids.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
You know, nobody wants to
scream at their husband.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:90%
You know, people are good--

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:90%
I believe-- in their hearts.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
But we are controlled
by these beliefs.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, I hate the word
when we say, "we're damaged."

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
See, I don't think
we're damaged.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I think once you get rid of the
beliefs, anything is possible.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, we were sharing
before the interview--

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
we did a study with
incarcerated men

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:84%
and why they do the
things that they do.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
They were getting out
of prison, and then

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.070 align:middle line:84%
instead of going to
rehabilitation or whatever,

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.360 align:middle line:90%
they came to us.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And we produced statistically
significant behavior changes

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
in people who couldn't even look
at us when we talked to them.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
They would just be like this
and like this, and by the 10th--

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
we did like, I think, 14
sessions and 12 sessions--

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and by the end,
the later sessions,

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
they were kind of looking at
us and it was amazing, amazing.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:84%
But they had beliefs like,
you know, as a way to--

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
if somebody does
something wrong,

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.547 align:middle line:84%
they deserve to be punished,
and the way to be punished

00:14:36.547 --> 00:14:38.880 align:middle line:84%
is to be beaten because that's
what happened to him when

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.900 align:middle line:90%
he was a kid.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:90%
So he concluded.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just that he saw that.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.840 align:middle line:84%
He actually gave
it the meaning--

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:90%
ah, oh, I see.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
When you do something wrong,
you deserve to be punished.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And the way to be
punished is to be beaten.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know anything else.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So that was a
conclusion he reached.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And conclusions
live in your mind.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And so once those beliefs
get-- you know, once he got,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I never saw that I
deserved to be punished.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I just saw that I was punished.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see that
everybody does that.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:90%
See, I want to make that point.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
When you were little,
parents, or people--

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
your mother is women,
your father is men,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:84%
or if you have same
sex parents, you know,

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:90%
that's just the way it is.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So we make these gender
roles, sweeping statements.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.478 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I ask people,
do you have the belief--

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
like, because they tell
me, I can never get what,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always efforting,
and I'm always struggling.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Money comes hard.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes hard.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'll say to them,
say this out loud,

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:84%
because this is how you test
to see if you have a belief.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Say, life is hard.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And they look at me, and
they go, well, life is hard.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Like, that's not a belief.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Life is hard.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
That's-- you know, there
are certain beliefs that are

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:90%
so real to people.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So when we worked with these
incarcerated men, or my best

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:90%
population--

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
incest survivors
and rape victims.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm damaged goods.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm worthless.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm powerless.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Men have all the power.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:90%
[MOUTHS EXPLOSION SOUND]

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.490 align:middle line:84%
When those beliefs go away
in one or two sessions,

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.770 align:middle line:90%
there's a freedom that's--

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:90%
it always makes me cry.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And they no longer have
to define themselves

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
by something that happened
in their childhoods.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.339 align:middle line:84%
Now, their parents, as
to speak to the point we

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.440 align:middle line:90%
were just talking about--

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:84%
their parents are not
horrible, bad, terrible people.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They're either, you know,
in the case of an incest

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:84%
survivor, that's serious,
possibly either mental illness,

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:21.440 align:middle line:90%
or could be beliefs.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's not generally
the people they work with.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:84%
They don't come to
me, unfortunately.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know a lot
about what causes that.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
But I do know for sure that
beliefs are probably involved,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:84%
and I do know for sure
that it's undoable.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
gratifying work in the world.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And also, working
with teenagers--

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
here's-- you know, I can't work
with young kids unfortunately,

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.710 align:middle line:90%
but we kind of start at 12.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Here are kids who
have beliefs that will

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:90%
inform the rest of their lives.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you get rid
of them, it's magic.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.460 align:middle line:90%
It's really powerful.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can attest to that
because my life has started

00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:84%
over and over again
throughout my life.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's these new
emanations of your life,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, wow, I didn't
think that was possible,

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
or I've done this,
or I've done that.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's come through
shifting beliefs about what

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I believe to be possible.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And I want to touch a
little bit on this idea

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.763 align:middle line:84%
that meaning is not inherently
true or correct because there's

00:18:33.763 --> 00:18:35.180 align:middle line:84%
another gentleman
we interviewed--

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if you're
familiar with him--

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Ira Israel.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:90%
And I love him.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
He's written a book called, "How
to Survive Your Childhood Now

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.600 align:middle line:90%
That You're an Adult"--

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:90%
great title.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But he had a horrific
accident, and he nearly died.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.065 align:middle line:84%
And had big face
trauma and body,

00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's just nearly
missed his artery.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And he lived with
this victim mentality.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
People should say,
what happened to you,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.170 align:middle line:90%
what happened to your face?

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.132 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I nearly
died in a car accident.

00:18:59.132 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't till
many years later

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:84%
that he was in a workshop,
and this gentleman said,

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:90%
you didn't really die.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:90%
You added that.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:90%
There was an accident.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:84%
All these other things
make you this victim

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of this story of your life, and
then you're stuck in this rut

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.650 align:middle line:90%
unnecessarily.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
He says, you can't nearly die.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.010 align:middle line:90%
You're either dead or alive.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.288 align:middle line:90%
You can't nearly be pregnant.

00:19:19.288 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
You're either pregnant
or you're not.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So all these ways that we
add meaning to our lives

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:90%
can really control us.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So could you speak to this
idea of meaning and attachment

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and making things up
in our minds, really?

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So for many years, my husband
thought that we come in,

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
we form beliefs, and
then we give meaning

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:90%
given the beliefs that we form.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, we realized--
we sat, and we

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:84%
went we really looked
at this, and we realized

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.690 align:middle line:90%
that meaning comes first.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:90%
You come into the world.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:90%
You give meaning, right?

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Why are my parents struggling?

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.285 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess money is
scarce and hard to get.

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, there they are.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:90%
They're struggling again.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, boy, it really
looks like money

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:90%
is scarce and hard to get.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, you
start believing it.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, your beliefs will determine
the meaning you give events.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, let's assume
somebody walks by and doesn't

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:30.610 align:middle line:84%
speak to you, and you have the
belief "people don't like me,"

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:84%
you're going to give
it the meaning that he

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:90%
doesn't like you.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
If you believe-- if you
don't have that belief,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have any
specific beliefs about people,

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.072 align:middle line:84%
people are fine,
somebody walks by you

00:20:43.072 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't say hello, you
might give it the meaning,

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
oh, maybe they didn't see me, or
maybe they're having a bad day.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:90%
If you have the mean--

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:84%
sorry, if you have the
belief "I'm not good enough,"

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.912 align:middle line:84%
and you have a
project that fails,

00:20:57.912 --> 00:21:00.370 align:middle line:84%
you're going to give it the
meaning, oh god, I'm a failure,

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm a loser, I'm terrible.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
If you have the belief mistakes
and failures are learning

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:84%
opportunities, and
that's how you grow,

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:90%
and your project fails, you go--

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, I once heard
Steve Wynn speak,

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
the famous hotel
builder, and he said,

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.220 align:middle line:84%
you know, I want
to tell you when

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
what happens when one of my
buildings fail, you know,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.352 align:middle line:84%
when one of my hotels
goes bankrupt, what I do.

00:21:28.352 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And everybody takes
out their pens,

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're all ready
to write, and he

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:35.270 align:middle line:90%
goes, I build another one.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So the meaning he gave
it is sometimes you win,

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes you lose.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:90%
And you just build another one.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.090 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't stop him.

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't flatten him.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take him out
because of the meanings

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.390 align:middle line:90%
that he gives the events.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:90%
We give meaning all day long.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, because the meanings
are informed by our beliefs,

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, you want to
get rid of your beliefs.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:90%
When I got rid of the belief--

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
now, this is a belief
that runs people.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.610 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good enough
is having other people

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.590 align:middle line:90%
think well of me.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would walk away from
people going, did he like me?

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Da da da.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.307 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm
doing an interview.

00:22:17.307 --> 00:22:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Did I say the right thing?

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:90%
Am I talking to much?

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:90%
Ugh-- like that, right?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
When I got rid of that
belief, I had the freedom

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:90%
to be my authentic self.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:90%
So I'm talking to you.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
All I care about is the
people who are listening.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I want to give everything
I have in the time

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.718 align:middle line:90%
that we have to the people.

00:22:35.718 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:90%
Some people will like me.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Some people won't.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.697 align:middle line:84%
Some people will say, oh,
she has a New York accent,

00:22:39.697 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:84%
or she talks too
much-- whatever.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:90%
You can't please everybody.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I knew that before,
but it didn't matter.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So when something
happens now, I just

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:90%
don't give the same meaning.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So my father and my
brother used to say things,

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and I would get defensive
and angry and carry--

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:84%
it was like, you can't talk
to me that way, [GESTURES]..

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, and once
the belief went away,

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:90%
I stopped giving meaning.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So they would say things, and
I would just go, all right.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:13.942 align:middle line:90%
You think I'm stupid.

00:23:13.942 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, and now I know
they don't think I'm stupid,

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.927 align:middle line:90%
but they say stuff like that.

00:23:17.927 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:90%
And it just didn't--

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:90%
it didn't have an impact.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And because it didn't
have an impact,

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
they started responding
to me differently.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.550 align:middle line:10%
Well, I didn't really
mean that, you know?

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the thing--

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
you can get rid of
meaning in the moment.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's two ways I'm going
to teach you how to do that.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:43.883 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume that somebody
doesn't speak to you.

00:23:43.883 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Somebody walks by and
doesn't say hello,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.620 align:middle line:90%
and you start to get upset.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Or your boss yells at
you, and you go, oh god.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:84%
The moment you have a negative
emotion, stop and ask yourself,

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.745 align:middle line:90%
what just happened?

00:23:57.745 --> 00:24:00.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Oh, let me give you
a parenting example.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:90%
My kid just mouthed off at me.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.250 align:middle line:90%
What meaning did I give it?

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:90%
They mouthed off at me is here.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me is here.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Meaning is never
inherent in the events.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Meaning is in your mind.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you get that the meaning
is separate from the event,

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:90%
the emotion will go away.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.333 align:middle line:90%
Now, you can handle it.

00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
You can say to
your child, I don't

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.120 align:middle line:90%
like being spoken to that way.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't speak to you that way.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.888 align:middle line:84%
You know, you could
say, what's up?

00:24:37.888 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Are you having a bad day?

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.412 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you a great story.

00:24:40.412 --> 00:24:41.370 align:middle line:90%
It's my favorite story.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:84%
You can also look at it and
say, what just happened?

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:90%
My teenager mouth off at me.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.140 align:middle line:90%
What meaning did I give it?

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:90%
What else could it mean?

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
It could mean they're a hormonal
teenager having a rough day.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.430 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:90%
Now, take the last step--

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
what does it really mean that
they just spoke to me that way?

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And another way of
saying that, James,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:25.580 align:middle line:84%
is, what do I know for
sure because that happened?

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.520 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that it doesn't
have consequences.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:90%
It isn't that we--

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
you know, that it
doesn't matter.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, I use the example--

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
my husband died three
and a half years ago,

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and I miss him every
minute of every day.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:90%
He was an angel on this planet.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:90%
He was-- he was my everything.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd give anything
if he wasn't dead.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
he's dead doesn't

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:84%
mean I'll never be happy again,
or I'll never smile again,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.830 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to starve
to death, or my business

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:90%
is going to go under.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And those were the
meanings that I

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:84%
was giving it that wanted
to keep me in bed all day.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I would use
this process every day.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:90%
I would grieve.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
I would cry.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:90%
I would feel my pain.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But then I would say, OK, now,
what meaning are you giving it?

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.428 align:middle line:90%
Oh god, I have to go to work.

00:26:20.428 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to a business.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:84%
What's going to
happen to my business?

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
well, it could mean

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
that your business
is going to go under,

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.698 align:middle line:84%
and it could mean
that you're going

00:26:27.698 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
to step up and make your
business even better, which

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.760 align:middle line:90%
is what happened.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't mean anything.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anything for sure
because my husband died other

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:42.700 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's not to
negate the emotions

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:90%
or the missing or the grief.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you shouldn't
feel your emotions.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But when you want to get rid
of them, that's how you do it.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:90%
It sounds too easy to be true.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, meaning is a process for
getting rid of a belief, right?

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:03.931 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Getting rid-- no,
meaning is a process

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:12.350 align:middle line:84%
that gets rid of an
emotion in the moment

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
because if I have
a negative emotion,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't react powerfully
because I'm upset, right?

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
rid of a belief,

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
then you need to get that
you never saw your belief.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
We also have a way to
do this emotionally.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.680 align:middle line:84%
At the end of our process,
we do it emotionally.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.680 align:middle line:84%
But basically, if you want
to get rid of a belief,

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:45.350 align:middle line:84%
you have to get that I never
saw my belief in the world.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It was something I just
made up, like Santa Claus.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.850 align:middle line:90%
And that's a whole process.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm making
it very simple.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, we take you
through a bunch of steps.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.275 align:middle line:84%
It's not complex, but it's not
as simple as I'm making it.

00:27:58.275 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Like, oh, I never saw that.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And you can eliminate a
belief tripping over a rock.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But what you can
do intentionally

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of beliefs is to look
at what are the beliefs that

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.500 align:middle line:84%
are causing my problems and
do this kind of process,

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:90%
and it goes away.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Could we finish the
story a little bit about

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.000 align:middle line:84%
the incarcerated criminals
that were coming out?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Because you mentioned
one story briefly about,

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.987 align:middle line:84%
I believe, that the way to solve
conflict is to beat a woman.

00:28:27.987 --> 00:28:29.570 align:middle line:84%
But then there was
the other gentleman

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.590 align:middle line:84%
who believed the
right thing to do

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:31.922 align:middle line:90%
was to shoot somebody, right?

00:28:31.922 --> 00:28:33.755 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you go
through that because they

00:28:33.755 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:84%
are radical beliefs
that people have

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and people can identify
them in some way.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.582 align:middle line:84%
And then, did these
people get better?

00:28:40.582 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, what happened
to their lives after?

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to hear that story
closed out with that study?

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So we did a prison study with
the University of Arizona,

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.630 align:middle line:84%
where we actually produced
statistically significant

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.515 align:middle line:90%
behavior change with prisoners.

00:28:59.515 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can't remember if it
was-- it was a long time ago--

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.190 align:middle line:90%
12 to 14 weeks.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And these were young,
incarcerated men

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
who were getting out of
prison and about to go back

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to see
how this work would

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.230 align:middle line:90%
impact the recidivism rate.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:90%
One of them was a--

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
they were called in those
days a "wife beater."

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And he sat down with
us, and he said,

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to beat women.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me?

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:90%
I want to stop this.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And the belief that he had was
when you do something wrong,

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
you deserve to be punished,
and the way to be punished

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:90%
is to beat.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So when his girlfriend or
his wife did something wrong,

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:84%
he believed that she deserved
to be punished and to be beaten.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:90%
That was what you do.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't occur to
him to not do that.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was stunning watching
their faces when they got--

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:90%
oh, that's not the truth.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
There are other ways
to deal with when

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:90%
people don't do what you want.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:90%
The other young man--

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:84%
we formed such a relationship
with him working with him

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that I invited him to our home
in Connecticut at the time.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting with
my daughter, Blake,

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and being really,
really sweet to her.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
you know, it is

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:84%
amazing to see the sweetness
underneath the man who

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.970 align:middle line:90%
shot people.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And Morty had worked with him.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's the deal?

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, when I was
a kid, I grew up in the hood.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And my father used to
tell me that if somebody

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:57.860 align:middle line:84%
gets in your face and razzes
you, and you don't shoot them,

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.180 align:middle line:84%
you will lose
respect in the hood.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:84%
When he finished working
with us, he said to me,

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:90%
I shot somebody over a $5 bill.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, Shelly, it never
occurred to me not to.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, I was so terrified that
if I lost respect in the hood,

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.390 align:middle line:90%
I'd get shot.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:22.610 align:middle line:90%
So he goes to see his father--

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.200 align:middle line:90%
in prison, of course--

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.720 align:middle line:90%
and he says if--

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and he tells his father about
this work that he did with us.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And his father looks at
him and says, I was wrong.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth it.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:90%
Powerful.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Good thing he met you.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh god.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It was-- we continued
the relationship,

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and watching this kid
is like-- we worked--

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:90%
we were on The Leeza Show.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Leeza Gibbons was a
national show years ago.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And Morty actually went on.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, we were both on.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And he worked with a skinhead,
and he had the beliefs--

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
when he was growing up,
somebody mugged his mother

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.340 align:middle line:90%
and happened to be black.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And his father used to
badmouth black people.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:26.800 align:middle line:84%
He had the belief that
black people are dangerous.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And on television,
we did the process,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.370 align:middle line:90%
and he got rid of this belief.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, normally, one belief
does not necessarily

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:90%
change somebody's life.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.440 align:middle line:90%
It can, but it doesn't usually.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get all the
beliefs underneath a pattern.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But this kid-- just
something shifted in him.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.200 align:middle line:90%
It was two beliefs--

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.025 align:middle line:84%
black people are
dangerous, and you

00:32:49.025 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:84%
have to watch out for them
or something like that.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:84%
He started to go around
to skinhead meetings

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and talk to them about
how they were misguided

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and that it wasn't true about
black people, and it became,

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.230 align:middle line:90%
you know, his mission.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the amazing
stories, by the way--

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.550 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, profound,
and life-changing,

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.380 align:middle line:90%
world-changing, right?

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.478 align:middle line:84%
Because we have huge,
seemingly insurmountable issues

00:33:23.478 --> 00:33:24.520 align:middle line:90%
in this world right now--

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.890 align:middle line:90%
hatred, racism, division.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:30.532 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:30.532 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can shift that
with the belief shift?

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I was once watching a politician
do something, you know,

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and I was like
screaming at the TV.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.930 align:middle line:10%
I was like so upset.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And my husband looked
at me, and he said,

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.310 align:middle line:84%
if you grew up in the
house he grew up in,

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.387 align:middle line:84%
you would have the
same beliefs he had,

00:33:53.387 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and you would be saying
and doing the same things.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:middle line:90%


00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe peace in
the Middle East is beliefs.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:05.350 align:middle line:90%
They want to kill us.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.700 align:middle line:90%
They hate us.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.909 align:middle line:84%
You know, and there's
cultural beliefs,

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:13.030 align:middle line:84%
you know, beliefs that run
in organizations' culture.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:17.350 align:middle line:84%
We used to do a lot of
work in organizations.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Beliefs, yeah,
inform everything.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.929 align:middle line:90%
You do what you do.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:27.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, I got up at
6:30 in the morning

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:34.600 align:middle line:84%
to do this because I believe
that if people hear this,

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
they will know they can be
free, and my belief is freedom,

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.820 align:middle line:84%
being in life free to be your
authentic self is everything.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It's why-- it's why parenting is
my passion because if we could

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:84%
raise children to be
their authentic selves,

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to know that they can
contribute to the world,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that who they are
makes a difference,

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.670 align:middle line:84%
that some people are going
to like them and some people

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.170 align:middle line:90%
aren't--

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:09.910 align:middle line:90%
it's OK.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's OK.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But they could be free
to walk their paths,

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:90%
unencumbered by these beliefs.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.470 align:middle line:90%


00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I want to tell you a story.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm at a conference,
and I have a friend here.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And she started out life--

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she had when
I met her, and this

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.930 align:middle line:84%
is a pretty left-leaning
organization.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.140 align:middle line:84%
We were at a dinner
table one night,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and she made a comment,
I said something, well,

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:84%
but that's how the
evangelical Christians think.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well, I'm
an evangelical Christian.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.340 align:middle line:90%
And I went, you are?

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.670 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't see that coming.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I was just really surprised
being in an organization

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.492 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:36:03.492 --> 00:36:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
were my beliefs

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:06.325 align:middle line:84%
about what does
it mean if you're

00:36:06.325 --> 00:36:07.800 align:middle line:90%
an evangelical Christian, right?

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.540 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean anything.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.680 align:middle line:90%
This was many years ago.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So we were spending
the weekend together

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.500 align:middle line:84%
at her beautiful
home in Big Bear.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.270 align:middle line:90%
And I said to her, tell me--

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:84%
tell me about your beliefs,
about being, you know,

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:90%
evangelical Christian.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:90%
And how is that for you?

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
Shelly, listen to me.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
sex before marriage,

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:42.600 align:middle line:84%
but if my daughter does, I'll
take her for birth control.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:84%
She said, I don't
believe in abortion,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle line:84%
but if my daughter has
one, I'll love her,

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.800 align:middle line:90%
and Jesus will love her.

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell the story
ever without crying

00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:01.250 align:middle line:84%
because if the world were like
that, if people were like that,

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.820 align:middle line:90%
the world would work.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I believe.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:90%
What do you believe?

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, cool.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.930 align:middle line:90%
It was just like--

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.510 align:middle line:84%
but again, that's
the power of beliefs.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:13.490 align:middle line:90%
We die for our beliefs.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:15.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't believe
what I believe?

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to kill you.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Like, what?

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to stop.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:90%
That's what my mission is--

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:27.390 align:middle line:84%
you know, to eliminate the
beliefs that cause suffering,

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.540 align:middle line:90%
but also to just let people be.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Here's the-- this was
my husband's brilliance

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.990 align:middle line:90%
for parenting.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're not hurting
yourself-- if your child is not

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:46.460 align:middle line:84%
hurting himself,
another, or something,

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:84%
they should be able to
do whatever they want.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:90%
You're not the boss of them.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:57.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, I say, if we could
shift the paradigm from we

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:84%
are the boss of our children to
we are our children's guardian

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:84%
angels, how would you
speak to somebody if you

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:90%
were their guardian angel?

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:12.120 align:middle line:84%
How would you treat them as
opposed to if you're the boss?

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Sit down.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:13.720 align:middle line:90%
Get over here.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.200 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.490 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.613 align:middle line:90%
That's the boss, you know?

00:38:18.613 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
go to this school.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.030 align:middle line:90%
You're going to do this.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.490 align:middle line:90%
You're going to do that.

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:25.430 align:middle line:84%
What comes from being
the boss of your child?

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm powerless.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I have to do what other
people tell me to do.

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:34.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not a belief you want
your children to have.

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the last thing you
want your children to have.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:41.015 align:middle line:90%
You know, I believe--

00:38:41.015 --> 00:38:47.160 align:middle line:90%


00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say this because
I want it in here someplace.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So I was talking before
about the belief what

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:84%
makes me good enough is having
other people think well of me

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and how that runs
people's lives.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You will throw your child
sometimes under the bus

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:84%
because you're worried about
somebody thinking badly of you.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Stop it!

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Don't touch that!

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Leave it alone.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're going
to think I'm a bad mother.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Stop crying.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.265 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
worried about what

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.040 align:middle line:84%
strangers that you're
never going to see again

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.430 align:middle line:90%
think of you.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So here's the best tool
you can give your children.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.620 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you do, somebody
is not going to like it.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.970 align:middle line:84%
So you may as well
do what you want.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:33.690 align:middle line:84%
However, before you do
anything, stop and ask yourself,

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:38.830 align:middle line:84%
what might the consequences
of my actions be?

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And do I want to live
with those consequences?

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So when your child
gets to be a teenager,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.040 align:middle line:84%
you do not want them asking,
oh, what did I think--

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, my daughter
was at a party once,

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and it was at the top of my
hill, no cell phone service.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And she found out the
designated driver had a drink.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And she came home,
and she said, Mom,

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.460 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be very happy.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, why?

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.200 align:middle line:84%
She said, because when my friend
said to the designated driver,

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I saw you drinking, I
actually asked myself,

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.300 align:middle line:84%
what will the consequence
be if I stay in this car?

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:22.320 align:middle line:84%
She didn't ask, what will
people think if I get out?

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It was lifesaving.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:84%
What are the most common beliefs
that people have that you see?

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.602 align:middle line:84%
Because there must be
patterns with this, right?

00:40:34.602 --> 00:40:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one of the
things I'd like you to speak to

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:84%
is a lack of self-worth
because our culture is

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:90%
this like-addicted culture.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.680 align:middle line:84%
We're built upon how many likes
on social media did I get,

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.560 align:middle line:84%
am I as successful or liked
as much as this other person?

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that we walk
around in the world driven

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.590 align:middle line:84%
by that as opposed to our
own sense of self-worth.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So what are the
most common beliefs

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:90%
that you see that people have?

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And how could those beliefs
be shaping or withholding them

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.330 align:middle line:84%
from living a truly authentic
and passionate life?

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.896 align:middle line:90%
I love what you just said.

00:41:07.896 --> 00:41:11.420 align:middle line:90%


00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So I just did a parenting
talk at a conference,

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and it was the five
most common beliefs

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.810 align:middle line:84%
that will keep your
children from having

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.560 align:middle line:90%
the lives you want for them.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.120 align:middle line:90%
So I will tell you that.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.610 align:middle line:84%
But self-esteem-- and you
just said this so beautifully,

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:26.900 align:middle line:90%
James, thank you--

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.950 align:middle line:90%
self-esteem comes from yourself.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It comes from
esteeming yourself.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I could do a whole hour talk
on just what is self-esteem.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:43.750 align:middle line:84%
We think our self-esteem
comes from outside of us.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So we have what we call
survival strategy beliefs.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:52.360 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good enough
is being successful.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And by successful, I mean
achieving things, right?

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So the self-esteem beliefs,
which I will talk about

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.260 align:middle line:90%
in a minute, are here.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.998 align:middle line:90%
Number one belief--

00:42:05.998 --> 00:42:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I have never worked
with anybody that

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.760 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have it, which is
why I talk about parenting.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:15.330 align:middle line:90%
I'd love getting tired.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.990 align:middle line:90%
I want to retire someday.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.970 align:middle line:90%
So I am not good enough.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good enough
is achieving things.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.830 align:middle line:84%
That's workaholism
right there, right?

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.030 align:middle line:90%
The second belief--

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm not important.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.800 align:middle line:84%
What makes me important
is being successful,

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.940 align:middle line:84%
having a lot of money,
achieving things.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.083 align:middle line:84%
So as long as I'm doing
it, this beach ball

00:42:38.083 --> 00:42:40.000 align:middle line:84%
called I'm not good
enough, I'm not important,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.770 align:middle line:90%
stays underwater.

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a driven behavior.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:47.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call them survival
strategy beliefs, right?

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So you think your self-esteem,
because this is underwater,

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.977 align:middle line:90%
is now intact.

00:42:54.977 --> 00:42:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And people say to
me, oh, I don't have

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.730 align:middle line:90%
the belief I'm not good enough.

00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:59.650 align:middle line:90%
I say, really?

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.260 align:middle line:90%
What makes you good enough?

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And if they answer
anything other than,

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:10.030 align:middle line:84%
"nothing, I just am,"
they have a belief.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.940 align:middle line:90%
What makes me good enough is--

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.820 align:middle line:84%
this is-- I think
this is fascinating.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.740 align:middle line:84%
If you are the oldest
of 10, what do you

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.690 align:middle line:90%
think you get acknowledged for?

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:90%


00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Taking care of the
siblings, helping.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So these people conclude
very, very often, oh,

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.840 align:middle line:90%
what makes me good--

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm not important.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of 10.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Am I getting a lot of attention?

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Not a shot.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if your mother is
the best person in the world,

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and your father is amazing,
you can't give 10 kids

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:48.160 align:middle line:90%
your undivided attention.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not good enough.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:52.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm not important.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I get acknowledged for
helping, taking care of.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:00.820 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good enough is
taking care of people, right?

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.460 align:middle line:84%
The way to be important
is to take care of people.

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them
when I get clients

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.320 align:middle line:84%
who are the oldest of 10
or have a sibling that's

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.200 align:middle line:84%
the oldest of 10, I say,
oh, are they a nurse,

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:90%
or are you a nurse?

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.535 align:middle line:90%
How did you know that?

00:44:15.535 --> 00:44:19.300 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] How did your
beliefs inform your life?

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:90%
That's how.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.150 align:middle line:84%
If I believe what
makes me good enough is

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:24.220 align:middle line:84%
taking care of
people, guess what I'm

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.810 align:middle line:90%
going to spend my life doing?

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:27.220 align:middle line:90%
Taking care of people.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:30.520 align:middle line:84%
If I get acknowledged
for pleasing people, what

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.410 align:middle line:84%
makes me good enough
is pleasing people,

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.810 align:middle line:90%
now I become a people pleaser.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's very elegant in
the way we look at it.

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So the first beliefs
are, I'm not good enough,

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not important,
mistakes and failures

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.160 align:middle line:84%
are bad, if I make a mistake
or fail, I'll be rejected.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Those are the four
most common beliefs.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:45:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Self-esteem beliefs, or I'm
not worthy, I'm inadequate,

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not capable--

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and let me say something
very important here.

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:08.830 align:middle line:90%
My mother was an angel.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.450 align:middle line:90%
She was the most love--

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:12.370 align:middle line:90%
she was love on legs.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:16.190 align:middle line:84%
If you came into her space, you
got love, whether you wanted it

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.990 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:18.880 align:middle line:90%
That's who she was.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.660 align:middle line:84%
So when I was little, she
did everything for me.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'll do it, mamaleh.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:25.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it, sweetheart.

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was, of course,
a Jewish mother.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it.

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.298 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it, sweetheart.

00:45:29.298 --> 00:45:30.970 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't stand
to see me struggle.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Guess what I concluded?

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:33.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm not capable.

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.910 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't come
from bad parenting.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the thing--

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I could do a lot of things well.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you looked at my life,
you would never think--

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.350 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know I had that belief.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:52.260 align:middle line:84%
But every time something came
hard to me, I didn't do it.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I'd stamp it out
and ask a friend.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd tell
somebody else to do it.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say, well,
I'm going to tackle it.

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm going
to go for it because I

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.200 align:middle line:90%
believed I wasn't capable.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't come out
except when I suddenly

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.860 align:middle line:84%
couldn't do something well,
which I usually just didn't do.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not capable--

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and again, this doesn't
come from bad parenting.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.490 align:middle line:84%
You can love your
child to death and do

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:24.210 align:middle line:90%
things that don't serve them.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:25.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm inadequate.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm not capable.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worthy.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't deserve.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Those are the most
common beliefs.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:39.780 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good enough is
having other people think well

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:44.940 align:middle line:84%
of me is the single most common
survival strategy belief.

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And what makes me good
enough are my achievements.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Those two are
tremendously common.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> This is really deep.

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.170 align:middle line:84%
This went deeper than I thought
because one thing I'm observing

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:01.810 align:middle line:84%
in this is that
people go to the world

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and become a workaholic
to hide their beliefs

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:08.770 align:middle line:84%
or to try to prove themselves
right or somebody else wrong.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting
observation is

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:15.310 align:middle line:84%
my father was successful
in a worldly respect.

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.163 align:middle line:84%
He worked really hard,
but he burnt out.

00:47:17.163 --> 00:47:18.580 align:middle line:84%
He got really sick,
and that drove

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.610 align:middle line:84%
us to start "Food Matters"
and explore that nutrition

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.060 align:middle line:90%
could help and help him detox.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.977 align:middle line:84%
And he healed his body and got
off medications and was well.

00:47:25.977 --> 00:47:27.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's a good story in the end.

00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> However, he worked and
worked and worked and worked

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and worked and
worked and burnt out.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:34.330 align:middle line:90%
And so many people--

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I call it BOMAPS, Burnt Out
Middle-Aged Professional

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:38.320 align:middle line:90%
Syndrome.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And so many people are
suffering from that,

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:45.262 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing it now as they're
compensating for a belief,

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're out there pushing
and pushing and pushing

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:47.940 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.482 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
why aren't I happy?

00:47:49.482 --> 00:47:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't I at
peace with my life?

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I have
this sense of peace?

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'll look at, say,
an indigenous culture,

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.180 align:middle line:84%
where they may not
have this well,

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.010 align:middle line:84%
you have to have money
to be successful,

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have
things to be successful,

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and you have to have this.

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you have that,
then you are a good human,

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can give yourself
self-worth because that's--

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:09.940 align:middle line:90%
you know, you've made it.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't have
it, so they're happy.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:12.702 align:middle line:90%
>> They're happy.

00:48:12.702 --> 00:48:13.502 align:middle line:90%
>> They're happy.

00:48:13.502 --> 00:48:14.412 align:middle line:90%
>> Ha, I love it!

00:48:14.412 --> 00:48:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I look at my father,
and he's gone through this

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:17.110 align:middle line:90%
life--

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I need all these things, and
then I'll finally be happy.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I look at
the world, right?

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.433 align:middle line:84%
We are just killing
ourselves for our beliefs,

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and then we get
there, and they're

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:26.267 align:middle line:84%
like this is the
retirement thing,

00:48:26.267 --> 00:48:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and they retire and die unhappy.

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:30.205 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:48:30.205 --> 00:48:31.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:31.005 --> 00:48:32.125 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is fabulous.

00:48:32.125 --> 00:48:35.580 align:middle line:90%


00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So I want to say two
things about that.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:41.630 align:middle line:84%
First of all, people are
not like I want to be right,

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:42.430 align:middle line:90%
and he was, oh--

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:44.360 align:middle line:90%
and he's selfish, and he's this.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I have had people call
me, James, and say--

00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I use this one guy.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:54.010 align:middle line:84%
He owned a very successful
wealth firm, wealth management

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.380 align:middle line:90%
firm, financial firm.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
Shelly, I don't--

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.660 align:middle line:84%
my wife's-- I'm
worth $10 million.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.850 align:middle line:90%
My wife's ready to leave me.

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:05.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know my kids.

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I keep promising I'm going to
leave the office, and I can't.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going
to lose everything.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the cover of
business publications.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.450 align:middle line:90%
When is it going to be enough?

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:19.970 align:middle line:90%
To which I replied, never.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.080 align:middle line:90%
It's never enough.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Here's why-- because
your success doesn't--

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.060 align:middle line:90%
exactly what you just said--

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.660 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make you good enough.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.770 align:middle line:90%
It makes you feel--

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:33.880 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make you feel.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.320 align:middle line:84%
The meaning you
give it makes you

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.240 align:middle line:90%
feel good enough for 10 minutes.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.970 align:middle line:90%
So oh, I just--

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.870 align:middle line:84%
I use Hollywood, famous
people in Hollywood.

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:46.210 align:middle line:84%
You look at Marilyn
Monroe, Heath Ledger,

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:49.090 align:middle line:84%
you know, people who
have burned brightly--

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Philip Seymour Hoffman.

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Drugs, you know, suicide--

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:57.070 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I have the belief
I'm not good enough.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.680 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good enough
is money, fame, power,

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.690 align:middle line:90%
beauty, right?

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I now have all of those things.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.890 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make me good enough.

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:14.050 align:middle line:84%
See, if something
makes you something--

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.570 align:middle line:84%
if you participate
in the Olympics,

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.880 align:middle line:90%
that makes you an Olympian.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm now an Olympian.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to do it anymore.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm an Olympian for
the rest of my life.

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:26.470 align:middle line:90%
This is a heroin addiction.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:30.250 align:middle line:84%
What makes me good
enough is being famous.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:33.910 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm famous, except
the belief didn't go away

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:37.540 align:middle line:84%
because I still
think I saw I'm not

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:41.390 align:middle line:90%
good enough from my childhood.

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:44.740 align:middle line:84%
So as long as I saw it,
it's not going anyplace.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:49.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't not believe
something you think you saw.

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:51.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why our
beliefs stay with us.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.800 align:middle line:90%
So now, we get the money.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.700 align:middle line:90%
We get the fame.

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:55.660 align:middle line:90%
We get the power.

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.880 align:middle line:90%
We're CEO.

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I think it's hilarious that
every fear of public speaking

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:05.500 align:middle line:84%
client I have says, oh,
the minute the CEO walks

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.000 align:middle line:90%
in the room, I panic.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And then I get the
CEO on, and he says,

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:13.690 align:middle line:84%
oh, I have 1,500 employees,
and I have to make a speech,

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a wreck.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.520 align:middle line:90%
He's the CEO.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Because guess what?

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.210 align:middle line:84%
He has the same beliefs
the other guy has.

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Being the CEO didn't
make him not good

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:26.198 align:middle line:84%
enough because
when I said to him,

00:51:26.198 --> 00:51:28.240 align:middle line:84%
where did you get the
belief I'm not good enough?

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my father, you know,
called me an idiot every day,

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.000 align:middle line:84%
or my father criticized
me, or I could never please

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.290 align:middle line:90%
my father, whatever it is.

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:37.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:39.040 align:middle line:90%
Then, we do the process.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Oh, doesn't it seem like
you saw I'm not good enough?

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.000 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you saw I'm not good
enough, then that must be true,

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that he's
famous is irrelevant.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.990 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:51.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
beliefs are so driven.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.530 align:middle line:84%
That's why people
kill themselves

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.830 align:middle line:84%
because when they get what
they want, like your father--

00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I reached the pinnacle,
and guess what?

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.170 align:middle line:90%
It didn't change anything.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:04.247 align:middle line:90%
The beliefs don't go away.

00:52:04.247 --> 00:52:06.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So having said that, this is
how I want to make sure we end

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.940 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:84%
not end with this, but
we have this in here.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:20.740 align:middle line:84%
If, in fact, your
beliefs determine

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:28.780 align:middle line:84%
the outcome of your life,
what is your job as a parent?

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Every time your child walks away
from an interaction with you,

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:38.260 align:middle line:84%
stop and ask yourself, what
did they just conclude?

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And is that a belief
I want them to have

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.210 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their lives?

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not, just
go back and clean it up.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Just say, I didn't
mean to yell at you.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I was just having a bad day,
or I just got frustrated.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I-- use I messages.

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:57.850 align:middle line:90%
You didn't frustrate me.

00:52:57.850 --> 00:52:59.620 align:middle line:90%
You didn't make me anything.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:00.920 align:middle line:90%
I felt sad.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.720 align:middle line:90%
I felt bad.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.630 align:middle line:90%
I felt angry.

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:04.210 align:middle line:90%
I felt disrespected.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.860 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you feel, clean it up.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Let the child know
they are fine.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.980 align:middle line:90%
You had a moment.

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is the most
important thing.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
is, at what cost--

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:23.320 align:middle line:84%
at what cost must
you have your child

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.490 align:middle line:90%
do what you want them to do?

00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:30.850 align:middle line:84%
At what cost to
their self-esteem,

00:53:30.850 --> 00:53:36.180 align:middle line:84%
to their ability to be free and
in the world and be themselves?

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is worth it.

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:41.150 align:middle line:84%
If they're not hurting
themself, another, or something,

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:43.320 align:middle line:90%
let it go.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.840 align:middle line:90%
I was going to tell you a story.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.030 align:middle line:84%
My daughter was very
hormonal and a teenager,

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:52.530 align:middle line:84%
and she walked in
the house one day.

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:53.450 align:middle line:90%
And my husband--

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:55.130 align:middle line:90%
I called him the Jewish Saint.

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:58.840 align:middle line:90%
He was just an amazing father.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And she walks in one day,
and he said something,

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:06.580 align:middle line:90%
she said something.

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:84%
She goes, oh my god,
you're being such a dick!

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:13.090 align:middle line:90%
And I like--

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.530 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what?

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:16.210 align:middle line:90%
You know, I jumped off my chair.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- I didn't even
know what I was going to do,

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.147 align:middle line:90%
but I was going towards her.

00:54:19.147 --> 00:54:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you speak to this
amazing father like that?

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And he turns around,
he looks me, said,

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Shelly, relax, it's a word.

00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:30.790 align:middle line:90%
He didn't give it meaning.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:35.200 align:middle line:84%
She walks into her
room, slams the door.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.600 align:middle line:84%
He goes to the door of
her room, and he says,

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I hear a teenager
who loves her father

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and is not in touch
with it at this moment.

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:47.200 align:middle line:90%


00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And from inside the
door, you hear a giggle,

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and she throws her
shoe at the door.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Then, she comes out, and she
goes, oh my god, Daddy, I'm

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:58.750 align:middle line:90%
so sorry.

00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry.

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I never, ever want to talk
to you like that again.

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't deserve-- I had
the worst day of my life.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.620 align:middle line:90%
He held her.

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:07.940 align:middle line:90%
They had a moment.

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And here's why I
share this story--

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.020 align:middle line:90%
Mother's Day.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:17.270 align:middle line:84%
A few months ago, we're sitting
at the Jacuzzi at my place,

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.240 align:middle line:90%
celebrating Mother's Day.

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.830 align:middle line:90%
We started talking about Morty.

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Mom, it wasn't
that he said those words.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:33.410 align:middle line:84%
It was in that moment, I knew
he would love me no matter what,

00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that I could be a brat, that
I could be a spoiled whatever,

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and that he would love me.

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And my husband's proudest moment
was when she was a teenager,

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.135 align:middle line:84%
and they walked down the
street, she held his hand.

00:55:50.135 --> 00:55:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.530 align:middle line:84%
They-- I'm afraid to
say this because I

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:57.300 align:middle line:84%
don't want to ruin
my credibility,

00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:00.450 align:middle line:84%
but they never
fought after that.

00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:02.925 align:middle line:90%
It was the most amazing moment.

00:56:02.925 --> 00:56:05.550 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power
of not giving meaning,

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.480 align:middle line:90%
of not having it at what cost.

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.580 align:middle line:90%
She's got to talk to me.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, you're making me cry.

00:56:18.915 --> 00:56:19.905 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:56:19.905 --> 00:56:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a great story.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so beautiful.

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:23.970 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:25.060 align:middle line:90%
The power of love, right?

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.270 align:middle line:90%
>> The power of love.

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:29.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Unconditional love, yes.

00:56:29.742 --> 00:56:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Shelly.

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Last question.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.340 align:middle line:90%


00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.030 align:middle line:90%
How do we change the world?

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:39.790 align:middle line:84%
How do we make this
world a better place?

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:42.220 align:middle line:84%
If we are such
conditioned beings,

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and our conditioned
behavior causes

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:48.040 align:middle line:84%
us to go out into the
world and struggle and toil

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:50.400 align:middle line:90%
and have mental turmoil--

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've never seen the
rates of anxiety and depression

00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.270 align:middle line:84%
that we have, ever, in the
history of well, and suicide,

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.023 align:middle line:90%
for that matter.

00:56:57.023 --> 00:56:58.690 align:middle line:84%
We're dying of our
own accord, and we're

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:02.350 align:middle line:90%
dying lonely and in anguish.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:05.960 align:middle line:84%
How do we solve that
anguish, either in the moment

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and as a whole, for
the future of humanity?

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting because
it's my least favorite question

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:22.640 align:middle line:84%
because the answer,
for me, is so simple.

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.860 align:middle line:84%
If we could get rid
of our beliefs that

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:34.930 align:middle line:84%
have us feel anxious, that have
us feel hate, that have us not

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:39.970 align:middle line:84%
honor other people for
whatever they believe,

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that when people
eliminate their beliefs,

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.330 align:middle line:90%
they are in life differently.

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:50.830 align:middle line:90%
They're not defensive.

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:52.540 align:middle line:90%
They're not protective.

00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:54.830 align:middle line:90%
They're not angry.

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.850 align:middle line:90%
And not defensive is very big.

00:57:57.850 --> 00:57:59.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to defend myself.

00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.638 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to prove myself.

00:58:01.638 --> 00:58:02.930 align:middle line:90%
People are going to watch this.

00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:05.440 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, boy, that's
great, or if she's--

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.730 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I just can present,
give what I have,

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:14.950 align:middle line:84%
hope that some people are
positively impacted by it.

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:17.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a very powerful concept.

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But the real way that the
world is going to change

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:26.020 align:middle line:84%
is if you don't hit
your child, your child

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:32.110 align:middle line:84%
will never believe that violence
is the way to handle things.

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:34.150 align:middle line:90%
That will stop war--

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.380 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- that's
just not an option.

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:43.300 align:middle line:84%
See, our behavior is limited
by the boxes or the beliefs

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.350 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Inside the belief that violence
is a way to handle things,

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:51.580 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of possible
actions you could take--

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:56.560 align:middle line:84%
shoot, bomb, you
know, take over.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But the option of conflict
resolution is outside the box

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:04.210 align:middle line:84%
that violence is the
way to handle things,

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.890 align:middle line:90%
and beliefs are boxes.

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So we have to raise
children who are conscious.

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And by that, I mean who honor--

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:17.350 align:middle line:84%
so I used to tell my
children, I treat you

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:20.380 align:middle line:90%
with dignity and respect.

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:22.910 align:middle line:84%
You treat me with
dignity and respect--

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:25.000 align:middle line:84%
not because I'm your
mother, but because that's

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.180 align:middle line:90%
how you treat people--

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.220 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.917 align:middle line:84%
You cannot like--
you cannot like them.

00:59:28.917 --> 00:59:30.250 align:middle line:90%
You cannot want to be with them.

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:33.550 align:middle line:84%
You cannot care for
what they believe in.

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But you treat
people respectfully.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.930 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to be
spoken to like that.

00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:43.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I'm not going to
be with you if you're going

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.440 align:middle line:90%
to treat me badly.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not.

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to call
you an idiot and a moron

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.570 align:middle line:90%
and hit you and scream at you.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:52.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to.

00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So if we raise a conscious
generation of children

00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.250 align:middle line:84%
who believe that mistakes
and failures are learning

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:02.800 align:middle line:84%
opportunities, or that there's
no such thing as mistakes

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.600 align:middle line:90%
and failures.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.900 align:middle line:90%
There's only outcomes.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.040 align:middle line:90%
You like the outcome?

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:06.850 align:middle line:90%
You don't?

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Fix it.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.010 align:middle line:90%
No judgments.

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I tell parents-- get
rid of four words--

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.660 align:middle line:90%
right, wrong, good, bad.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't ever use them again.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Describe what you think,
what you feel, what you want,

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:21.520 align:middle line:90%
what you need.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Use I messages.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.900 align:middle line:90%
But get rid of judgments.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.060 align:middle line:90%
And the world will work.

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.060 align:middle line:90%
It just will.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.570 align:middle line:90%


01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:32.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Magical, Shelly.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:34.790 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
What a powerful
message you have.

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:48.000 align:middle line:90%
