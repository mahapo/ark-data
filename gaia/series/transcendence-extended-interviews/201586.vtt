00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:09.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.900 align:middle line:10%
And I'm excited to be
speaking to an industry store

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.810 align:middle line:10%
well when it comes to the
health and wellness world.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.640 align:middle line:90%
His name is Dave Asprey.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And you probably know him
because of the term Bulletproof

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Coffee.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder of
Bulletproof everything--

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Bulletproof Labs, Bulletproof
Radio, Bulletproof Coffee,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and some incredible
products to help

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:84%
improve your brain, your
life, and your function

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:90%
as a human on planet Earth.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to be
talking about everything

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:84%
from smart drugs, to plant
medicine, to his daily ritual,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and also how it all
started for him.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Did I get that right?

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
"New York Times' best selling
author as well, right?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.750 align:middle line:90%
Two books now.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That is true.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> There we go it.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Keeps getting bigger.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.700 align:middle line:84%
It's been a few years between
chats, but I'm excited.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm happy to be
here for you, James.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm blown away at just
the positive reception

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and that whole story that says,
you can control your biology.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And mother nature
designed it that way.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:84%
You just have to know
what the right inputs are.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So you had an
interesting, unique,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
humble SFO to travel the world,
to biohacking experience.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Tell us how this
started for you--

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
the real, early impetus,
all the way up to that top

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:90%
of the Tibetan mountain.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I used to weigh 300 pounds,
about 50% more than I weigh

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And as a young man,
[LAUGHS] I had everything.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I made $6 million dollars
when I was 26 years old.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:90%
And I lost it when I was 28.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But then, once I had everything,
I had arthritis in my knees

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:90%
since I was 14.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed high risk
of stroke and heart attack

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.420 align:middle line:90%
before I was 30.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I had serious brain fog, which
wasn't working very well.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:90%
I was prediabetic.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing all the
things you're supposed to do.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So I worked out an hour and a
half a day, six days a week.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I could max out all the
weightlifting machines,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:90%
except for two.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:90%
And I still weighed 300 pounds.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my friends
who were eating cheeseburgers,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm eating the salad with
no dressing and with no chicken.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And I just was, wait
a minute, I can bench

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.183 align:middle line:84%
press all my friends while
they're eating this stuff.

00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I eat less than
any of them, and I'm

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.850 align:middle line:90%
fatter than all of them.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt like it's
because, obviously, I'm

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:90%
a failure.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And I just realized
one day, I'm doing

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:90%
everything I'm supposed to do.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm not cheating.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.452 align:middle line:90%
And maybe I have bad advice.

00:02:31.452 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, I'm
going to do all the things

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:84%
as a computer scientist
that are supposed to work.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.790 align:middle line:90%
And I checked them off the list.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't work.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm going
to do the things that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:84%
aren't supposed to work
but some people think work.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what the
heck, let me go to Tibet

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and learn meditation
from the masters.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Let me go to South
America and to Peru

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:90%
and try ayahuasca with a shaman.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Let me do the Eastern stuff.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:90%
That stuff works.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And it works very well
with Western medicine.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And today, the manifestation
of Bulletproof and just the way

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.340 align:middle line:90%
I live my life--

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:84%
it uses a lot of
ancient knowledge

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.123 align:middle line:84%
that, today, we're just
discovering, oh, yeah,

00:03:12.123 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that
worked the whole time.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We just never done
this, because we

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
were such arrogant
Western scientists.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So I think the worlds are coming
together very beautifully.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> So you were a programmer.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:84%
You were in computer
data security.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:90%
And that was your early stage.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And you took that
frame of reference

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
to go and hack your
biology, in a way.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I used to run the web and
internet engineering program

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
in Silicon Valley to teach
engineers working at companies

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.180 align:middle line:90%
how to build the internet.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And I launched what is likely
the first cloud computing,

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
the modern provision, and
pay-as-you-go thing like AWS

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
back in the mid to late '90s.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, I was
an influential guy

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
in that time in my career in a
very small but influential part

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:90%
of the tech world.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:84%
The problem was, if I can manage
this weird internet thing where

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't own most of
the computers there

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.470 align:middle line:84%
but somehow we can diagnose and
change, well, when doctors told

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:84%
me there was nothing
they could do for me,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
how hard could it be to
influence and change this?

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
mindset that says,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
as Western medical doctors,
or as academic scientists,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
every little thing in order

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.160 align:middle line:90%
to do something.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's always hubris,
because it turns out

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.437 align:middle line:84%
everything we think
we understand,

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
we probably don't really
understand all the details.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
But as long as we feel like we
do, then we can take action.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:90%
So we're paralyzed.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But as a computer hacker, if I
want to gain entry to a system

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:84%
or break it, I don't
need to know everything

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:90%
about how it works.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I need to know how it
responds to certain inputs.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.705 align:middle line:90%
And I can manipulate it.

00:04:42.705 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what we
do to our biology.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.872 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wrote the definition

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:84%
of biohacking that just became
a word in the English definition

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:90%
last year.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Merriam-Webster's added
it to the dictionary.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And biohacking's
the art and science

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
of changing the environment
around you and inside of you

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.710 align:middle line:84%
by just changing things so
you have your own biology

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:90%
under your own control.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And I just wanted to control.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be fat.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.513 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be tired.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be hangry,
and cranky, and hypoglybitchy,

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and all the bad things that
I didn't choose but were

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:90%
happening to me.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.393 align:middle line:90%
They don't happen anymore.

00:05:14.393 --> 00:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's because I set
up the world around me.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And I got rid of
the bad thinking,

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
stuff, and went

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:84%
to a very deep level,
both emotionally,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:90%
spiritually, but physically.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And the secret that
no one had told me

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
was that, if you want to
do the personal development

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:90%
work, if your body--

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:84%
your hardware-- isn't
working very well,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.680 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be really
difficult, if not impossible.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So get your body
working well enough

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to make enough energy to
create personal change.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And that has been
transformative for me.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.450 align:middle line:90%
Well said.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:84%
So in your journey
to hack your biology,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
you ended up
climbing a mountain.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
You ended up being
ushered into a tent

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:90%
and drinking some weird yakness.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I decided I was
going to go to Mount Kailash,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
which is the holiest mountain,
pretty much, in the world.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So Hindus and Buddhists look
at that as Mount Olympus.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.100 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
gods actually live.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
climb the mountain.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But you're allowed to walk in
a circle around the mountain,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:90%
always clockwise.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's a religious pilgrimage.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, this sounds cool.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite
understand five days

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
of riding in a four-wheel drive
across Tibet to get there.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It is in the middle
of nowhere, as far

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.800 align:middle line:90%
as you can get from anywhere.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.430 align:middle line:90%
And I get there.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's 18,000 feet
above sea level.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's 8,000 meters
or something like that.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.783 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty high.

00:06:43.783 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't quite
Everest, but it

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:84%
was getting to very thin
air, way above where you're

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:90%
going to feel comfortable.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed to feel kind
of like death at that altitude.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.198 align:middle line:90%
There's no oxygen. It's awful.

00:06:54.198 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was a little
bit late, 'cause I

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:90%
didn't plan the vacation well.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So I was there when it
was 10 degrees below 0.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's wind's howling at
40, 50 kilometers an hour.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm really feeling awful.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And I went to this
little mud hut.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And a Tibetan lady
gives me yak butter tea.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.582 align:middle line:90%
And I've never had it.

00:07:14.582 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But there was almost
no food there,

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.248 align:middle line:90%
other than just barley flour.

00:07:17.248 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:90%
So I drank it.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple of minutes,
my brain just turned on.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going,
I feel better now

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
than I have in the last couple
months, and I should not.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:90%
This is not possible.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:90%
So it just stuck in my mind.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And I drank a lot
more yak butter tea.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I got back to
Silicon Valley, I said,

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what I can
do to replicate this.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.897 align:middle line:84%
I said, all right, I'm going to
get some tea, and some butter,

00:07:39.897 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:90%
and I blended it up.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
It tasted bad, and
it didn't work.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.475 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, it's the tea.

00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And $500 worth of
expensive Chinese tea

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.665 align:middle line:84%
later, I realized
it's not the tea.

00:07:47.665 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:84%
So I went and I
tried the butter.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:90%
And I tried 25 kinds of butter.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that
grass-fed butter works,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:84%
but normal American
corn and soy-fed butter

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
does not work, because
the fats are different.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I added something
called brain octane oil which,

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:84%
at the time, it was a
derivative of coconut oil,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:90%
and it still is.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And we've actually made
it a more pure substance

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:90%
than when I first started.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
MCT oil is a common name
for this category of oils.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I finally
got the recipe

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.607 align:middle line:84%
right after 1,000 or
so tests and trying it

00:08:17.607 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:90%
on friends and all--

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I had someone that
would reliably drink it.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And your brain wakes up
the way mine did in Tibet.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.115 align:middle line:84%
And since then, we've actually
sponsored some core science

00:08:27.115 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Washington--

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:90%
research and science--

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:84%
showing that droplets
of butter fat in water

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.152 align:middle line:84%
change the structure of
water so that your body

00:08:34.152 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to do that work.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Tibetans, for
thousands of years--

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
where there's no air, and it's
cold, and there's no food.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
They figured out that, if they
mix the tea and the butter--

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see these
little older ladies.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
manual butter churn.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're going, cha-chunk,
cha-chunk, cha-chunk.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:90%
And they do it for 10 minutes.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And then they drink it.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, why don't
you just eat the butter

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:90%
and drink the tea?

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.358 align:middle line:90%
It's because of the blending.

00:08:58.358 --> 00:09:00.775 align:middle line:84%
And so there's these little
nuances that they figured out.

00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know why.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand
water biochemistry.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
They just knew,
let's do what works.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.472 align:middle line:84%
And let's share it over time
and evolve it over generations.

00:09:09.472 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And now we're at this
point where we say,

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:90%
we know why it works.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we don't.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you, if you
blend the right coffee [LAUGHS]

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
and butter and
brain octane oil, it

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.110 align:middle line:84%
has an effect on you
that's noticeable.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about the right
coffee, the right butter.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
You spoke about the right
butter being grass-fed.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the
three and six is up.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:90%
The nine is lower.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.215 align:middle line:90%
It's less [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:30.215 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
A fair few people in the
nutrition world know that now.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And you've helped popularize
the grass-fed butter movement.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Great for cows, by the way.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:84%
They get to enjoy
eating outdoors.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Great for the
soil, too, right?

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
the right coffee.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:84%
You've funded
research and testing

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that coffee is low
in mycotoxins, or low in mold.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And why should people even care
about finding low mycotoxin

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:90%
coffee?

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people are entirely
unaware of what's happening

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:90%
in agriculture.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:84%
There's something called a
field toxin and something called

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:90%
a storage toxin.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And these are things
that grow on your crops

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.743 align:middle line:84%
in the field that are poisonous
for humans and animals.

00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And they track it
really carefully

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:84%
because, when they feed
these crops to animals,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
they notice an increase in
lesions in the arteries,

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:84%
a decrease in fertility,
a decrease in weight gain,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.790 align:middle line:84%
an increase in cancer,
ulcerations around the lips,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
increases in obesity, increases
in all the bad things that

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.110 align:middle line:90%
are happening to humans.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So ranchers will test for
field toxins and storage toxins

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.170 align:middle line:90%
in food.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And they only feed them to
animals that aren't pregnant

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.375 align:middle line:84%
before they're going
to slaughter them,

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
because they know they don't
make money if they eat them.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, for human
food, some countries

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:84%
have some standards for
some of these toxins.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And the US is one of the only
developed countries that has

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.332 align:middle line:90%
no standard for mold in coffee.

00:10:57.332 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, the
industry solved it.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:84%
China has standards
for mold in coffee.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Europe has standards
for mold in coffee.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed a former
president of the Specialty

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Coffee Association on
the Boulder plantation

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
in Guatemala where
he said, Dave,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:84%
I was in Japan when the
trade minister of Japan

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:84%
rejected 1,000 shipping
containers of coffee

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:84%
because it was too
high in mold toxins.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what did
they do with the coffee?

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we
sent it to America,

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
because [LAUGHS] it's
legal to sell it there.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:90%
And this is why it matters.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
It turns out the standards for
these plant-based compounds--

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
they're not good
plant-based compounds.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.662 align:middle line:84%
The standards are not in
place for human health

00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
or for making you
feel really good.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.040 align:middle line:90%
They're in place for economics.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:90%
So they say you can have--

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
in, say, Europe-- five parts
per billion of these toxins.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And another country, maybe
10 parts per billion.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
You cannot taste
parts per billion.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But they affect you at a
cellular, at a subcellular,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.390 align:middle line:90%
at a biological level.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's really scary.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
this, your body

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:90%
is a collection of bacteria.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in your body, except
for your red blood cells,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
is studded with hundreds to
thousands of ancient bacteria

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that create power
from air and food.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:14.790 align:middle line:90%
That's their job.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.082 align:middle line:84%
And they do a bunch of other
things like make hormones.

00:12:17.082 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So you're a walking
Petri dish of bacteria.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And bacteria's
ancient enemy is mold.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Penicillin comes from mold.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So mold and bacteria have
been fighting forever.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you take low
doses of naturally occurring

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
plant-based antibiotics in
your coffee, in your wine,

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in your grain, in your
corn, or in animals

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:90%
that ate those things?

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happens
is you don't run

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:90%
as well as you're supposed to.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not that hard.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are thousands of
medical studies supporting

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
what I'm saying and 34 of them
on the Bulletproof website

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
talking specifically about the
most common toxin in coffee

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:90%
called OTA.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:90%
So the science is really clear.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.557 align:middle line:90%
But why should you care?

00:12:55.557 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Because, when you drink
coffee that has mold

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
you won't taste in
it, you actually

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
get, about an hour
or two later--

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.120 align:middle line:84%
if you're sensitive,
especially-- you

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:90%
can get just cranky.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:90%
You can get hangry.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.500 align:middle line:84%
You can get
blood-sugar cravings.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:84%
You can get a crash,
like, I need more coffee.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.318 align:middle line:84%
So I gave up coffee
for five years,

00:13:11.318 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:84%
this great love of my
life, because it made

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:90%
me feel crappy half the time.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.957 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized
what was going on--

00:13:16.957 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
different coffees
do different things,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.832 align:middle line:90%
based on how they're processed.

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And the Bulletproof process
is lab-tested coffee,

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
because tiny amounts
of plant-based toxins

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:90%
can mess with your head.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I say, mess with your
head, let's talk about LSD.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:90%
LSD is a mold toxin.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:84%
It is made from something
that grows on rye.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It's an ergot alkaloid.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And we actually think the Salem
witch trials and this thing

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
called St. Elmo's Fire were
side effects from eating

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:90%
grains that had storage toxins.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:90%
We know that tiny amounts--

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:84%
100 micrograms-- of this
toxin can completely

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:90%
change a reality.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
We're that sensitive.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And as humans,
we're biologically

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:84%
wired to use our kidneys instead
of our liver to remove toxins.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're more sensitive than
rats, and horses, and sheeps,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and cows.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wowsers.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And just to think that this
low dose consumption of mold

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
in our diet could
be contributing

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to so much illness, and
also the mold that--

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:84%
as you point out in
"Moldy," the documentary--

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
could be in your home
and your environment,

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.910 align:middle line:90%
this is sort of a silent killer.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I know there's
diseases that they call

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:90%
unrecognized tropical diseases.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
People get parasites
and everything.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.417 align:middle line:84%
They call it unrecognized,
UTRDs or something.

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Mold seems to be in a
little bit of that category.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Most of the medical
profession is not

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:84%
talking about it, unless they're
a leading functional medicine

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:90%
doctor.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
They're like, you could
have mold toxicity.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.243 align:middle line:84%
But what are the impacts
that this can have?

00:14:45.243 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Man, if you look at people
with chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:84%
fibromyalgia, even
chronic Lyme disease,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:56.430 align:middle line:84%
there's about a 90% likelihood
that they have lived in a home

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.363 align:middle line:84%
that had toxic mold
growing inside it.

00:14:58.363 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
When I was a kid, I
lived in a home that

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:middle line:90%
had toxic mold in the basement.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.240 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't know it.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.530 align:middle line:90%
This was the 1980s.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
reasons I was obese

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and I had all this
brain fog as a young man

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
was that I was exposed
to these toxins.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:84%
When I did a test
with Dr. Daniel Amen

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
where we injected
radioactive sugar

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
and looked at where
it went in my brain,

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
the finding was, Dave, you have
chemically induced brain damage

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:90%
from mold toxins.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to reverse that
by removing them from my food,

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:84%
removing them from
my environment,

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
even spraying with a
spray called Homebiotic.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural bacteria that
eats mold as a fuel source.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So I inoculate my
home with that stuff.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.112 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I have more energy now
than I ever have before,

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:84%
because I was able to
take these things out.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
What I have learned is that we
have really strong abilities

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:90%
as human beings.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But things like mold
toxins, like bad fats

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
in our diet, things
like even health foods

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.088 align:middle line:84%
that actually aren't healthy,
not to mention fried stuff

00:15:59.088 --> 00:16:01.380 align:middle line:84%
and all the things you would
expect you shouldn't eat--

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
the first thing they do is they
suppress energy production.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And they harm those
bacteria whose job

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
it is to turn food
and air into energy.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.100 align:middle line:84%
When they're harmed,
you tend to get fat.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But before you get fat,
you get muffin top.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:90%
You get the swelling.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.070 align:middle line:84%
But the muffin top
that you can see here--

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.660 align:middle line:84%
that's not even a
problem compared

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.500 align:middle line:90%
to the muffin top in the brain.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
you get emotional.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is well documented
from toxic mold and a lot

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:90%
of these other toxins.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So you start yelling at
your kids or your boss.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.863 align:middle line:84%
And you wake up feeling like,
ugh, today is a really bad day,

00:16:31.863 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's someone else's
fault. What's going on

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is you're physically
inflamed and uncomfortable.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So what if we could just
turn that down a little bit?

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And what if we used other
plant-based compounds, maybe

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:84%
even natural
competitors to mold,

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and things that allow
your body to detox?

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Would you actually show up
differently as a human being?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Could you more easily
have a meditation

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that becomes a transcendent
experience if your biology is

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:90%
working right?

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.743 align:middle line:84%
I have data from 40 Years
of Zen, the neurofeedback

00:16:57.743 --> 00:16:59.160 align:middle line:84%
and personal
development institute

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that I started for
my own progress.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And I do this with executives.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
When we give people things that
make their cells work better,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
they can do about two
and a half times more

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
deep meditation with a
computer helping them

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:90%
before they just get exhausted.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.333 align:middle line:84%
So two and a half times more
personal development in a day

00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
if you eat the right stuff and
don't eat the wrong stuff--

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:90%
that's how important this is.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.105 align:middle line:10%
>> So food and personal
development are linked.

00:17:24.105 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:10%
I know there's
been entrepreneurs

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:10%
that I've met that
said, I became

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:10%
a successful entrepreneur
when I gave up

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.183 align:middle line:10%
wheat, or et cetera-- those
distinctions that people make.

00:17:33.183 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Or Novak Djokovic, world's
number-one tennis player,

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
he said, I became number one in
the world and won Wimbledon--

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
which was his age
six-year-old vision--

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:90%
when he gave up wheat.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It was actually about 12
months after wheat, dairy,

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:90%
and refined sugar.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So there are profound
insights and results

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:84%
that happen from people
radically shifting their diet.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
What are the key
things that you are

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:57.040 align:middle line:84%
a no-go on and the key
things that you are

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:90%
a go-more on in terms of food?

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Number one,
stop eating grains.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:90%
They're not good for you.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to be good for you.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to stop,
after the grains, the sugar

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:90%
and the bad fats--

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:84%
corn oil, canola
oil, or rapeseed oils

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:84%
as it's also called,
vegetable oil, soybean oil.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And replace those with
fats that are undamaged,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:84%
the way they're
found in nature--

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
butter, coconut oil, olive
oil from quality of sauces,

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:90%
and some nuts.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:84%
What you'd find is that
your cells work much better.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:90%
So you cut out the bad stuff.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You eat more of
those categories.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.278 align:middle line:84%
But the number-one thing on
your plate should be vegetables.

00:18:39.278 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
almost everyone gets wrong.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Vegetables are a
quarter of your plate.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So you cover the
plate in vegetables,

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.960 align:middle line:84%
cover the vegetables
in fat, and add

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:84%
a small amount of grass-fed
meat or wild-caught fish.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Eating the big steak
that we all love

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:84%
is shown to increase
inflammation and risk

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds of diseases.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And that goes doubly if it's
an industrially raised cow

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:90%
or any kind of animal.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So I have not eaten an
industrially raised animal

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:90%
in probably six years.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.832 align:middle line:84%
If it's not grass-fed,
I go vegetarian.

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It's that important because,
when you take an animal,

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.498 align:middle line:84%
and you feed it an artificial
diet, they have the bad fats.

00:19:14.498 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:84%
But they also get the
antibiotics and the roundup

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:90%
residues.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
And you eat those.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And they mess up
your gut bacteria.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.952 align:middle line:90%
They mess up your mitochondria.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:90%
They mess up your hormones.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth it.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:90%
So eat the good stuff.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.438 align:middle line:84%
It costs more, but you're
supposed to eat less meat.

00:19:28.438 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you eat no
meat at all, you're

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.147 align:middle line:90%
not going to like your life.

00:19:31.147 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't do well
on that diet, either.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> There's been a lot of
contention in the diet space.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But I think we're reaching
this consensus, which

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:90%
is 80% plants--

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
vegetables, mostly, some
low-sugar fruit, herbs,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.510 align:middle line:90%
superfruits, et cetera.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the other 20% is
great quality animal products

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:90%
or fats.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.150 align:middle line:90%
It could be eggs.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It could be wild-caught fish.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.955 align:middle line:90%
It could be sardines.

00:19:54.955 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:90%
It could be, et cetera.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It could be grass-fed animal
products, or wild deer,

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:90%
or elk, whatever it might be.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I think that's becoming
the norm, which is good.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm grateful
that you've helped

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:84%
to challenge a lot
of dietary dogma,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
because you are one
of the first ones

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
to really come out and support
this idea that fat is good.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I was a raw vegan
for a while before I went

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:90%
to Tibet.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I was really into it.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I could make these
raw vegan deserts,

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and eat a whole bunch of
fruit, and these massive

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
bowls this big full of
raw salad chopped up.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
It takes you two
hours to eat it.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And you'll feel great
on a diet like that

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
for about a month, maybe two,
as you get used to the idea

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:90%
that this is my new diet.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I feel great.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.202 align:middle line:90%
I'm losing weight.

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you might be
malnourished, no matter

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.340 align:middle line:90%
how much fat you put in it.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to maintain
your health that way.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.825 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, I'm like--
oh, my teeth started to hurt.

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and I got
autoimmune issues I

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.300 align:middle line:84%
didn't have before,
and new food allergies.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you realize,
well, this isn't working.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So this idea that the vegan diet
is good for humans is false.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:90%
It is provably false.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And the second idea that
it's good for the planet

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:90%
is also provably false.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.130 align:middle line:90%
I run a small organic farm.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have eight
pigs and four sheep.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And where the pigs root,
we have amazing soil,

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:90%
because they clear the soil.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Where the sheep inoculate the
soil with healthy soil bacteria

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
by pooping on it, we have
amazing grass and just

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.540 align:middle line:84%
a healthy ecosystem
with animals,

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:90%
and bugs, and all this stuff.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And where the sheep
and pigs don't go,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:90%
it's one third as productive.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot have vegan food
without animals pooping on it.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And vegans say, that's not true.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
What they don't
know is that, when

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:38.787 align:middle line:84%
you have these kinds of farms
that are only vegetables,

00:21:38.787 --> 00:21:40.370 align:middle line:84%
they're pulling stuff
out of the soil,

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're never
putting anything back.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's been shown that
regenerative agriculture,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
where you actually use animals
as part of the lifecycle--

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:90%
it pulls carbon out of the air.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.300 align:middle line:90%
It builds healthy soil.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And the forecasts are, because
of these grain-based diets

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and all these
healthy-for-the-planet diets,

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
we are 60 years away from
running out of topsoil

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.450 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're 40 years away from
running out of the minerals

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that we're mining
to put into the soil

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
in order to allow us to grow
these kinds of foods that

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:90%
aren't even good for people.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:90%
So here's the deal.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Buy meat from a local
farmer, if you can.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:84%
If not, insist on grass-fed
and, hopefully, organic.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do that,
don't eat the meat.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It's that important for your
health and for the planet.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.720 align:middle line:84%
No more torturing animals
in industrial feedlots.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:90%
That's bad for you.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:31.730 align:middle line:90%
It's bad for the animal.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It's bad for the water, for
the soil, for the planet.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:90%
We have to stop that now.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:90%
But then, what's left?

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, lots of vegetables.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, they
grow everywhere.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.396 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:22:42.396 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to transition a little
bit more now to plant medicine.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I really feel there's
a renaissance happening

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.380 align:middle line:84%
in humans identifying
plants, which

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:84%
can change their biochemistry,
which can change their life.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing cannabis, and CBD,
and combinations of CBD and THC

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:84%
become a huge trend
in the US here.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.530 align:middle line:10%
You've been on top of
a lot of unique ideas

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:13.490 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to using certain
compounds to hack the body, so

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:10%
to speak.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I've been at a dinner
party where you said,

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.750 align:middle line:90%
open your mouth, James.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.542 align:middle line:84%
You started spraying
nicotine on my tongue.

00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what the hell's
going on here, Dave?

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:84%
You talk about
charcoal, adaptogens.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Let's pick charcoal.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> This is ancient.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:90%
It's old-school.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:30.920 align:middle line:90%
It's powerful.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.423 align:middle line:90%
Why is charcoal so good?

00:23:33.423 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming it's
something that you

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:90%
take on a regular basis.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I manufacturer a charcoal
product for Bulletproof.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I take
charcoal every day.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And charcoal is amazing because
about a teaspoon of charcoal,

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
depending on how it's
made, can have the surface

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.395 align:middle line:84%
area of a football field
and/or a soccer field,

00:23:52.395 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
country you're from--

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:90%
same difference.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on there?

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's basically
these crinkly carbon.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So the little nooks and
valleys and canyons in it

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:84%
have this huge amount of
ability to bind to toxins.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And it has a strong
negative electrical charge.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.302 align:middle line:90%
So you take this.

00:24:08.302 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
If you take it with food that
has-- oh, I don't know-- mold

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.790 align:middle line:84%
toxins in it, it binds
to the mold toxins

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:84%
to the point that, in
agriculture ranchers will say,

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to buy the
food with these field toxins

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and storage toxins
that we know is bad.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.293 align:middle line:90%
But we're going to buy charcoal.

00:24:22.293 --> 00:24:23.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
put it in the food

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:90%
so the animals don't get sick.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.010 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of think, I'll
do that for myself, too,

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.145 align:middle line:84%
because their data
set is very strong.

00:24:30.145 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And there are
studies out there--

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
not of anything
that I manufacture,

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.105 align:middle line:90%
just of charcoal in general--

00:24:35.105 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
looking at what it does to
things like cholesterol,

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.250 align:middle line:84%
looking at what it does even
for longevity in animal studies.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:84%
They're living 15%
longer from having this.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with
charcoal in general

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:84%
is that it binds to all kinds
of toxins, including pollutants.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But the most
important thing that's

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
emerging for the
anti-aging field right now

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:84%
is something called
lipopolysaccharide.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:90%
You have gut bacteria.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.080 align:middle line:84%
All of us have some good
ones and some bad ones,

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:90%
even if you do everything right.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And the good ones keep
the bad guys in check.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.310 align:middle line:84%
But the bad guys make LPS,
which crosses the gut barrier

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.352 align:middle line:84%
and causes inflammation
throughout the body,

00:25:10.352 --> 00:25:11.310 align:middle line:90%
including in the brain.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.352 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things
that probably triggers

00:25:13.352 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:90%
some of the causes of aging.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.620 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal sticks to LPS.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a good
idea to take it regularly.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that it's so strong

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that, if you go to the emergency
room and you've been poisoned,

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.248 align:middle line:84%
they're going to pump
charcoal in your stomach.

00:25:27.248 --> 00:25:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So charcoal has to be taken
away from any medications

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:34.140 align:middle line:84%
or anything that you don't want
bound up in it, because it's

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:90%
that powerful.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.623 align:middle line:84%
So I take it on empty
stomach every day.

00:25:37.623 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> How did this work from
an Indigenous perspective?

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Did we have-- was it
charcoal on burnt meat?

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Or was it charcoal--

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
how did we get charcoal
back in the day?

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Is it an Indigenous
endemic idea?

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Indigenous cultures
everywhere knew that there were

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:84%
two things that worked for
parasites, for diarrhea,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.273 align:middle line:90%
and for GI upset.

00:26:00.273 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
activated charcoal.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.447 align:middle line:84%
The other one in
certain kinds of clay.

00:26:03.447 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably heard
bentonite clay is another one.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
These are toxin binders,
broad-spectrum ones.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.847 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in
Nepal and Tibet,

00:26:10.847 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:84%
you could go to
little street vendors.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have these little bags
or bottles of charcoal tablets,

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:84%
because there's
a lot of Giardia.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
parasitic things

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.788 align:middle line:90%
where people get diarrhea.

00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, oh, charcoal
is what you do if you have

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:90%
any upset for your stomach.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So if my kids have
an upset stomach,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:90%
do they get charcoal first?

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they do.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Does it usually work to
make them feel better?

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
If I eat something and
I feel weird afterwards,

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I take charcoal,
and I feel better.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.250 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty amazing.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But this has been around
for thousands of years.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.167 align:middle line:90%
It's used in Ayurveda.

00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:84%
It's used in traditional
Chinese medicine.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.695 align:middle line:84%
The Indigenous people in
the United States used it.

00:26:43.695 --> 00:26:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And you just go around the
world-- like, oh, we all

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:47.517 align:middle line:90%
knew about charcoal.

00:26:47.517 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what I love
about this renaissance--

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.000 align:middle line:90%
is that the old is new again.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're seemingly,
in a way, popularizing

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.165 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this stuff that has
just been happening forever.

00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the thing that really
drives me nuts is we actively

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:84%
denigrated it and made fun of
these natural things that have

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:84%
been happening for thousands of
years because we're so modern

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.600 align:middle line:84%
and so special that
we know better.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.850 align:middle line:90%
And we turn our nose up at it.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
We pop some antibiotics, and
eat some weird industrial food,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:90%
and think we're so superior.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.260 align:middle line:90%
However, it's not working.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, it
really didn't work.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So I said, all right, I'm going
to try this weird stuff that's

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:90%
not supposed to work.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.013 align:middle line:84%
So you try and go, wow, I'm
pretty sure that worked.

00:27:29.013 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Is there any reason
it could work?

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And then you find, oh,
there's 1,000 studies

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that my doctor
didn't know about.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.370 align:middle line:90%
And thank you, Google.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about adaptogens,
unique herbs or spices.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:84%
I know you're a big
fan of chopping up

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.483 align:middle line:84%
lots of fresh herbs,
and thyme, and rosemary.

00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:49.900 align:middle line:84%
What are the things that you're
working with or are seeing

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
as particularly
powerful when it comes

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
to reducing
inflammation or overall

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
healing the systemic nature
of a lot of illness we have?

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a class of
plant-based compounds called

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.710 align:middle line:90%
polyphenols.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And these are basically
the colored compounds

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.740 align:middle line:84%
that are present in anything
that's brightly colored.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find a
reasonable amount of them

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:84%
in leafy, green vegetables,
and fruit, and things

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.450 align:middle line:84%
like that-- but,
frankly, not that many.

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Where they explode is
in herbs and spices.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So the more herbs
and spices you use--

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.290 align:middle line:84%
things like rosemary,
oregano, thyme, fennel.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.450 align:middle line:84%
All those have masses
of these things.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
The average Westerner
gets about 1 gram

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of these powerful plant-based
compounds in their food

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.790 align:middle line:84%
if they're eating
just a regular diet

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:90%
and they're drinking coffee.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Coffee is the number one source
of polyphenols in the West.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And from an anti-aging
perspective,

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.280 align:middle line:84%
my goal is to get
4 or 5 grams a day.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.170 align:middle line:90%
So I drink my coffee.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:90%
I eat chocolate.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:90%
I drink green tea.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.400 align:middle line:90%
And I eat my vegetables.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.350 align:middle line:90%
I put extra herbs on them.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And I formulated a
polyphenol supplement

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:84%
that has way more polyphenols
than I can get from food

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:90%
from 10 different sources.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And I take that stuff,
because the evidence

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.250 align:middle line:84%
is that your cells can work
better when they have enough

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:90%
of these plant-based compounds.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So I look at these
anti-aging compounds

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and performance-enhancing
compounds.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Different polyphenols
do different things.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's this amazing
synergistic dance

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:84%
between what mother nature
makes and what humans want.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
makes us happy as humans

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:90%
is to perform better.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So no one likes to say, I cooked
dinner, and I did a crappy job.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Even if it wasn't necessary
you did a good job,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.680 align:middle line:90%
you just want to.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.137 align:middle line:84%
It feels good to do
something with excellence.

00:29:37.137 --> 00:29:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we're attracted to

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.610 align:middle line:84%
are things that enhance
human performance.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And you could say,
that's not true.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, sorry, fire
enhances human performance.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.410 align:middle line:84%
A million years
ago or something,

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.815 align:middle line:90%
there are two cavemen.

00:29:50.815 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said, I'm
going to use fire to stay warm.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.530 align:middle line:84%
The other one said,
that's cheating.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the guy who said, fire
is going to keep me warm,

00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.502 align:middle line:90%
he's our ancestor.

00:29:59.502 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] The other
guy didn't make it.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have a built-in,
innate desire to do that.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.590 align:middle line:90%
And for thousands of years--

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
probably tens of thousands
of years, really--

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.460 align:middle line:84%
we have been using
plant-based compounds

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is based
on direct observation

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.650 align:middle line:84%
from people who use them
over multiple generations.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And the mother
nature smart drugs

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:84%
that are just endemic out
there that people don't think

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
of as smart drugs,
number one, it's

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.240 align:middle line:84%
caffeine-- coffee,
tea, and chocolate.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Global wars have been
fought over these compounds.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:90%
They have fueled human progress.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The Enlightenment in Europe
was based on the explosion

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:90%
of coffee houses.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Civilization is tied
to these things.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:84%
You go back 5,000 years
in China, there was tea.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And they tracked the different
grades and what they did.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And we knew this.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.020 align:middle line:90%
You go back in India--

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.890 align:middle line:90%
tea.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Go back in Africa--

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.720 align:middle line:90%
coffee.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.640 align:middle line:90%
So this stuff has been around.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.718 align:middle line:84%
What's the other massive
most studied smart drug

00:30:56.718 --> 00:30:59.010 align:middle line:84%
that mother nature makes that
no one has ever heard of?

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:00.690 align:middle line:90%
It's actually tobacco.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Smoking is terrible for you.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows smoking
is bad for you.

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.393 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows it
makes you smell bad.

00:31:05.393 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
It makes you look old, and all
the bad stuff-- cancer, teeth

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.740 align:middle line:90%
falling out, whatever else.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
However, when people use
nicotine, they type 15% faster.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Their working memory improves.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:19.860 align:middle line:90%
They perform better.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And we are so wired
to perform better

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that we are willing to give up
the second half of our quality

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.790 align:middle line:90%
of life to feel good right now.

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And emerging studies
in the last 30 years

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:84%
from an academic
researcher at Vanderbilt--

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.920 align:middle line:84%
I called him Dr. Nicotine
when I interviewed him

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:90%
on Bulletproof Radio.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:84%
He's like, hey, here's
the first paper that

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:84%
shows, from the 1980s, that
low doses of oral nicotine--

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.600 align:middle line:84%
not smoked, but just
purified nicotine--

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.520 align:middle line:90%
reverse Alzheimer's disease.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.850 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what's
likely to kill you today,

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.935 align:middle line:84%
if you're in the West,
it's diabetes, cancer,

00:31:56.935 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:84%
heart disease, and
Alzheimer's disease.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And I just wrote
an anti-aging book

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.860 align:middle line:90%
looking at these four things.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:84%
What if a very tiny amount of
nicotine on a daily basis not

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
only made you smarter, faster,
made your cells worked better,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.320 align:middle line:84%
but also reduced your
risk of Alzheimer's?

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do not sell nicotine.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.280 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] If I did, I wouldn't
be allowed to say that.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.385 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say is
there is evidence of this.

00:32:16.385 --> 00:32:18.510 align:middle line:84%
There is also evidence that
large doses of nicotine

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:90%
or smoking are just bad.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.495 align:middle line:84%
The dose is, or the--
what does it say?

00:32:22.495 --> 00:32:24.120 align:middle line:84%
The dose is in the
poison, the poison's

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.545 align:middle line:84%
in the dose,
something like that.

00:32:25.545 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at these
plant-based compounds

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and just understand.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.080 align:middle line:90%
We want to feel good.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.080 align:middle line:90%
We want to perform well.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.622 align:middle line:84%
And mother nature
will help us do it.

00:32:32.622 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And plant-based compounds
are a big part of it.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Smart.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:42.630 align:middle line:84%
I feel better now for receiving
that spray onto my tongue.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:44.403 align:middle line:84%
You're like, James,
open your mouth.

00:32:44.403 --> 00:32:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you not feel amazing?

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt great.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:90%
I felt great.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I felt [LAUGHS] used.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:90%
I felt abused.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:51.522 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:51.522 --> 00:32:54.085 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you like that.

00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the other things
I wanted to speak to before

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:84%
moving on to a different little
track here is that we are

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:84%
suffering a crisis of
mental health in the West.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's terrible.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WHO have acknowledged that
mental health will be a big

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:84%
issue and increase to be
a big issue in the future.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.070 align:middle line:90%
We've got suicide issues.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:84%
We've got depression
and anxiety.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's 100 million
scripts of prescriptions

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.360 align:middle line:84%
written for
anti-depressants in the US--

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:84%
22 million people,
I believe taking,

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:90%
SSRI antidepressants daily.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:27.943 align:middle line:90%
What else can we do?

00:33:27.943 --> 00:33:30.110 align:middle line:84%
If people are suffering
from depression and anxiety,

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.260 align:middle line:84%
of course there is cognitive
therapy or meditation,

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.500 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness, being
barefoot, improving diet.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:84%
But shortcuts, hacks,
biohacking stuff--

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:84%
what can people do to
improve their mental faculty?

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Depression and anxiety
are largely biochemical,

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.650 align:middle line:90%
biological things that happen.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And we feel awful.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Our neurochemicals are off.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.055 align:middle line:84%
And then they
manifest themselves

00:33:53.055 --> 00:33:54.430 align:middle line:84%
as these things
that are supposed

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.600 align:middle line:84%
to get better when you
sit on a couch and talk.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And sitting on the
couch and talking

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
can be life changing
and very beneficial,

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.990 align:middle line:84%
because you at least realize
the voices in your head.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.407 align:middle line:84%
You realize what
you're believing.

00:34:04.407 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can learn
to manage it better.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's better if
you fix the biology

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.310 align:middle line:84%
because, when your
cells are working right,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.120 align:middle line:84%
these things can
oftentimes go away.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:84%
So what are the
big hacks for this?

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.610 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
has been transformative

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.230 align:middle line:84%
for treatment-resistant
depression--

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and something I just tried on
camera and did an interview

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:90%
on Bulletproof Radio about--

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is on using medically
assisted ketamine

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.364 align:middle line:84%
for treatment-resistant
depression.

00:34:29.364 --> 00:34:31.489 align:middle line:84%
You go into a doctor's
office once every two weeks.

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:33.080 align:middle line:84%
They give you an
injection in the muscle.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.429 align:middle line:84%
And for an hour,
you lay somewhere.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:36.929 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize the world
is actually an amazing place.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's easier to let go
of grudges you're holding

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.882 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:34:40.882 --> 00:34:41.840 align:middle line:90%
And you come out of it.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
aggressive depression,

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:90%
you're good for a couple weeks.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
There's transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And you see a picture
on my social media

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.949 align:middle line:84%
where my head's
clamped in this thing.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:90%
There's this giant magnet thing.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's
science fiction.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, they can target a
specific area of the brain

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.467 align:middle line:84%
and stimulate
electrical flow there.

00:35:00.467 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:84%
You can do neurofeedback,
which is something

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.900 align:middle line:84%
that I do at 40 Years of Zen,
my institute for that stuff.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can show the
brain, hey, here's

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.460 align:middle line:84%
how to make more of this
kind of a brain state.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:84%
You're connecting the
areas of the brain wrong.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.600 align:middle line:84%
The brain is so desperate to
self-organize and to be better.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.442 align:middle line:84%
It just has no data
about how it's doing.

00:35:19.442 --> 00:35:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So when he gets a little
bit of data from a computer,

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:90%
it'll adjust itself.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
obsessing over things

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.107 align:middle line:84%
and just not performing
well, they're

00:35:28.107 --> 00:35:29.940 align:middle line:84%
getting in their own
way and not knowing it,

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.940 align:middle line:84%
they suddenly stop
doing that when

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:35.590 align:middle line:84%
they're able to unlock
whatever is going on in there.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And is that a biochemical, or
is that an emotional thing?

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you can
separate the yin and the yang.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:90%
They come together.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's amazing-- ketamine.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.447 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you said
that, I'm like, hang on.

00:35:47.447 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty heavy
street drug, right?

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, ketamine is special
K-- people doing higher doses

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:84%
of it, having all
these weird things.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:58.820 align:middle line:84%
However, every emergency room
and every anesthesiologist

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:84%
pretty much around the globe
has access to ketamine.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:90%
It is cheap.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.180 align:middle line:90%
It's affordable.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.990 align:middle line:84%
In the US, there's about 1,000
ketamine treatment clinics

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.880 align:middle line:90%
opening now.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.570 align:middle line:90%
They're using a much lower dose.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's medically prescribed.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.740 align:middle line:84%
It's in a controlled setting,
very different from going

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:90%
to a rave or something.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But people are sensing
profound results from this.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's very similar to
what's happening when people

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.587 align:middle line:90%
do ayahuasca with a shaman.

00:36:21.587 --> 00:36:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Some people are depressed.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:84%
They do that one time,
and they're better.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And I did that almost
20, 25 years ago

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.550 align:middle line:90%
with a shaman in Peru.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.550 align:middle line:84%
I went down there specifically
to experience ayahuasca.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And you'll also see people
doing trials now with MDMA.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're dealing
with old trauma that's

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:38.562 align:middle line:90%
tied to their depression.

00:36:38.562 --> 00:36:39.810 align:middle line:90%
And they get better.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see similar trials
with psychedelic mushrooms.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And I have certainly used
psychedelic mushrooms

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.100 align:middle line:90%
in controlled settings.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:53.000 align:middle line:84%
They will allow you to
step outside yourself.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.870 align:middle line:84%
I even interviewed 500
people, including Rick Doblin,

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.640 align:middle line:84%
the head of MAPS,
who's spearheaded

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the
legalization of research

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:84%
into our own consciousness
using plant-based substances.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And what these 500
people agreed on as one

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:84%
of these 46 laws that came out
in the book "Game Changers"

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:13.760 align:middle line:84%
based on all this is
get outside yourself.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to find a way
to do that to perform better

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
as a human being, whether or
not depression is your issue.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it with
plant-based medicines.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And there's a rich
history of that.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.360 align:middle line:84%
There are also some people
who go nuts from doing it.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:90%
There is a risk.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.340 align:middle line:90%
It is not risk-free.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.010 align:middle line:84%
The risk is relatively
low, but it is there.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And there is also
a substantial risk

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:84%
from the faster and
deeper forms of meditation

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:84%
that's well-documented
in Buddhist literature.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you can do this.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't find
enlightenment, you may go nuts.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.290 align:middle line:90%
But don't worry.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:43.165 align:middle line:90%
You'll be born again.

00:37:43.165 --> 00:37:44.570 align:middle line:90%
You can try it later.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:90%
This is a real thing.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.050 align:middle line:90%
So meditation is not risk-free.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Plant-based medicines
are not risk-free.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But sticking with what
you've got is a 100% risk.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.623 align:middle line:84%
So whether you want to
use breathing exercises

00:37:56.623 --> 00:37:58.790 align:middle line:84%
like holotropic breathing,
which is something that's

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.377 align:middle line:84%
been really
transformative for me,

00:38:00.377 --> 00:38:02.210 align:middle line:84%
whether you want to use
neurofeedback, which

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:84%
is my primary toolset
for the stuff,

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.020 align:middle line:84%
you want to use
plant-based medicines,

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.490 align:middle line:84%
you want to use
shamanic drumming,

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.897 align:middle line:84%
you want to use long-distance
running, fasting for days,

00:38:09.897 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't really care.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.140 align:middle line:90%
But the evidence is in.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.870 align:middle line:84%
You must do something
to separate yourself

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.030 align:middle line:84%
from your meat so you can be
more aware of what's going on.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much every
ancient religion

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:84%
had a process and a
practice of doing this.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that was
necessary for human evolution.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.020 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't changed.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Very true.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's a concept that Danny
Vitalis first introduced me to.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.590 align:middle line:84%
There is a spectrum
of things that we

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.340 align:middle line:84%
have consumed as a species over
the history of our evolution.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was
psychedelic psychotropics,

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.315 align:middle line:84%
or things like this that
changed who we were.

00:38:44.315 --> 00:38:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was typically done in
more of a religious setting.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Can we zero a little bit in
on your ayahuasca experience?

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We're interviewing
across that.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.542 align:middle line:84%
We've already done some
interviews on this.

00:38:54.542 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:84%
This, to me, is
exciting because it

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:57.970 align:middle line:84%
seems that the
people that have gone

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:84%
through this type
of experience change

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.340 align:middle line:84%
forever for good and
almost after one go.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.140 align:middle line:90%
What was it like?

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.062 align:middle line:84%
>> I went down to Peru
before ayahuasca was cool.

00:39:10.062 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, very few
people had heard of it.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But I've always been
interested in the edges

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:90%
of human enhancement.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.830 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the guesthouse.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I want
to try ayahuasca.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.790 align:middle line:90%
And they said, what?

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And when they understood
in my bad Spanish

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.710 align:middle line:84%
what I was talking about,
they said, you're white.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] You'll throw up.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not for tourists.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, I know.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, however, make
the introduction.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So the next day,
the shaman shows up.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a carve of
a Jaguar's head made out

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.200 align:middle line:84%
of obsidian and
lives in the jungle.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And actually, his
house-- more mud hut.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And he showed me his stuff.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.550 align:middle line:90%
And it was pretty amazing.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So we set up a ayahuasca
ceremony on a hill overlooking

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
the ancient ruins in
Cusco called Sacsayhuaman,

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.670 align:middle line:84%
which sounds like "sexy
woman," but isn't.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And so, for about a day
or so, I drank this stuff.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.650 align:middle line:90%
And it was pretty neat.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.710 align:middle line:84%
This guy made a
circle of stones.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was a little
skeptical on this stuff.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm much more
open-minded than now.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up having to take
three doses of it, because--

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:15.220 align:middle line:90%
He said that's what I needed.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.525 align:middle line:90%
And he drank the stuff.

00:40:16.525 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he
said, all right,

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.567 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go on
a journey together.

00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I had another person
with me as well.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And I came out of it.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had this uplifting,
dreamlike experience.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I just felt really good,
better than I had in a while.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.350 align:middle line:90%
And I said, all right, I'm good.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.172 align:middle line:84%
And my other friend here,
and she's throwing up still.

00:40:35.172 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be
doing this for a while.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.055 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go for a hike.

00:40:38.055 --> 00:40:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And the shaman looks at me.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.582 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no.

00:40:40.582 --> 00:40:42.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean no?

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you see
that ring of stones?

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.257 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's keeping
all the bad stuff out.

00:40:47.257 --> 00:40:49.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you go past that,
he said, bad things will happen.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was literally going
to physically stop me.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to
suspend my disbelief.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.960 align:middle line:84%
He comes from a
lineage of thousands

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.965 align:middle line:90%
of years of doing this.

00:40:56.965 --> 00:40:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I don't
see anything out there,

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.370 align:middle line:90%
and I want to go for a hike.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
yield to an authority

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.260 align:middle line:84%
because, if he's right,
I shouldn't do this.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm right,
who the heck cares.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:90%
I'll go for a hike later.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
there is, when

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.720 align:middle line:90%
you get to know the shamans--

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and I've done training
with Alberto Villoldo

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and learned some
of the techniques--

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:84%
there's weird
stuff that happens.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's happening
all in your own mind,

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.220 align:middle line:84%
or in the universe around
you, or the underworld,

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.200 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what
you want to call it.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say my data
set is that there's

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:84%
interesting stuff out there that
isn't easy to see or detect,

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.910 align:middle line:84%
but that people I know from
different lineages-- including

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.820 align:middle line:84%
ancient Chinese medicine,
including South American

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:36.430 align:middle line:84%
things, Native
American religions.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:84%
They all seem to see and
report and say the same things.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And so just as a
scientist-- what's

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that first step of
the scientific method?

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Observe.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:47.530 align:middle line:90%
So I see this.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:48.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a pattern.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:49.967 align:middle line:90%
You can hypothesize.

00:41:49.967 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why it works.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.898 align:middle line:84%
I can make up lots of
stories and test them.

00:41:52.898 --> 00:41:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
through and you test.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And what I find is,
when I do shamanic work,

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I am better at what I do,
and I like my life better.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And ayahuasca was a
meaningful part of that.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And what was most interesting
is that the other person

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.780 align:middle line:84%
who did it with me
started out as a Catholic.

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.110 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And by the end
of the day, she said,

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to
change my religion.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not just Catholicism.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:84%
There's more to the
world than I thought.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe Western
monotheistic religions

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:31.260 align:middle line:84%
can perfectly well coexist with
these altered, exalted states

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.450 align:middle line:84%
that we, as humans,
are capable of.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And since that time,
I've done very deep work

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.170 align:middle line:90%
with neurofeedback.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I have had very
similar experiences

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to ayahuasca from deep, deep
meditation with a computer

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.040 align:middle line:90%
helping me do it.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I've had even deeper
experiences than ayahuasca

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.930 align:middle line:84%
from specific breathing
exercises called

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.340 align:middle line:90%
holotropic breathing.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:55.218 align:middle line:84%
And we have an innate drive
and need to leave our bodies

00:42:55.218 --> 00:42:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and experience the world
around us in an altered state.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.400 align:middle line:90%
It's part of being a human.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So ayahuasca, for me, was
one of the first things

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:05.100 align:middle line:84%
that I tried that really
opened my eyes to the fact

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that, wow, maybe I
can simultaneously

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.610 align:middle line:84%
be a rational computer
scientist, engineering

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.100 align:middle line:90%
entrepreneur, Wharton MBA guy.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I can also accept in
the world of shamanic stuff

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.980 align:middle line:84%
there's spirit
animals, and spirits,

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and whatever-- other
auras and energy fields.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.950 align:middle line:90%
They can both exist.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.568 align:middle line:84%
This is the rational
side of my brain,

00:43:25.568 --> 00:43:26.610 align:middle line:90%
and it works really well.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:28.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the irrational
side of reality,

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.007 align:middle line:84%
and it seems to work
really well, too.

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to fight
between them anymore.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.930 align:middle line:84%
I can effortlessly
move between the two.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And being able to do
something like ayahuasca

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.730 align:middle line:84%
was, for me, really helpful
just to look inside a world

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't even
think existed.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Good explanation.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Almost as if ayahuasca is
a gateway to consciousness,

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:50.610 align:middle line:84%
just like bacon's
a gateway [LAUGHS]

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:54.150 align:middle line:84%
to eating more high-quality
animal products.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:57.630 align:middle line:84%
They say, when someone's
transitioning from vegan

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.390 align:middle line:84%
or vegetarianism and
needing something richer,

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.310 align:middle line:90%
that that happens to them.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.000 align:middle line:90%
I digress.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.125 align:middle line:84%
Let's move on to a
wrapping discussion

00:44:06.125 --> 00:44:08.250 align:middle line:84%
here, because there's
something that you brought up

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:84%
in your book, which
also got mentioned today

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.520 align:middle line:84%
live at Consumer Health
Summit about weasel words.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And why I want to
talk about this

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.200 align:middle line:84%
is I want to keep this theme
of getting outside of yourself

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.990 align:middle line:84%
and observing your thoughts,
because you're about behavior

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and performance, from
the outside looking in,

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:25.335 align:middle line:90%
my observation.

00:44:25.335 --> 00:44:27.210 align:middle line:84%
You use biohacking tools,
and plant medicine,

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:28.627 align:middle line:84%
and all the things
we've discussed

00:44:28.627 --> 00:44:30.840 align:middle line:84%
to improve your
biochemistry and meditation,

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.068 align:middle line:84%
holographic
breathing, et cetera.

00:44:33.068 --> 00:44:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Holographic-- what is it?

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:34.470 align:middle line:90%
Holo--

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Holotropic.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Holotropic breathing--
holotropic breathing.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe that
language has the capability

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.080 align:middle line:84%
to shift our perception
about who we are,

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.390 align:middle line:84%
whether we're a
victim or a victor.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.528 align:middle line:84%
And your weasel word thing
today struck a chord with me

00:44:48.528 --> 00:44:50.070 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
few interviews I've

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:84%
done about recovering
from trauma

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.010 align:middle line:84%
or peeling back things which
could be holding people back.

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And inner dialogue and self talk
is a huge component of that.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.820 align:middle line:84%
What have you learned in your
experience on this topic?

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It is almost hard to state
how important having a clean

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:08.890 align:middle line:90%
inner dialogue is.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:09.858 align:middle line:90%
And the weasel words--

00:45:09.858 --> 00:45:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and this is something I built
into the culture of Bulletproof

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and into my own life, something
that my kids know very well.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:17.305 align:middle line:84%
And they hold me accountable, so
I hold them accountable, too--

00:45:17.305 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:84%
is if you tell yourself
things that aren't true

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, but I
meant something else,

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:24.270 align:middle line:84%
your body is too dumb
to understand that.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.170 align:middle line:84%
There is an unconscious
part of you.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
listens to everything

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.660 align:middle line:84%
you say and believes
it, which is scary.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.535 align:middle line:84%
So you and your conscious
part of the brain--

00:45:33.535 --> 00:45:34.827 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, I don't believe that.

00:45:34.827 --> 00:45:35.850 align:middle line:90%
I know that's not true.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:36.670 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.212 align:middle line:84%
The other part of you that does
things when you're not paying

00:45:39.212 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:90%
attention-- it's doing stuff.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you say, I can't
do that, it actually

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:46.460 align:middle line:90%
means you can't do that.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So if someone says, hey, Dave,
can you come to lunch today,

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:52.120 align:middle line:84%
or will you come to lunch day,
and I say, oh, I can't make it,

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.290 align:middle line:90%
it's not true.

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I probably could stop
whatever I had on my calendar.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And I could say, I'm
going to make it,

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.560 align:middle line:90%
which is the truthful thing.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So what I say is, I'm
not going to make it.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It actually is
relaxing to say that.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The other person says, oh, that
was a really high-integrity

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.800 align:middle line:90%
answer--

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.325 align:middle line:90%
same general meaning.

00:46:10.325 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And what if it's
something a little bit

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:16.780 align:middle line:84%
more important, like I have to
go to the store on the way home

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:17.648 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:46:17.648 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You're saying, why
is that important?

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, you were supposed
to go spend some quality

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:23.380 align:middle line:84%
time with your kids
or your spouse,

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:26.140 align:middle line:84%
but you "had to"
go to the store.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Since you knew you had to do
it, that told your subconscious

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
die if you don't do it.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.350 align:middle line:90%
There's no choice.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the real
choice was, I'm going

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:37.150 align:middle line:84%
to go to one of the grocery
delivery services on my phone,

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:39.713 align:middle line:84%
have the groceries delivered,
and go be a parent.

00:46:39.713 --> 00:46:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't think
of that, because he

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:44.860 align:middle line:84%
used a weasel word
unconsciously or subconsciously.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:48.068 align:middle line:84%
And when you say
"try," "try" means

00:46:48.068 --> 00:46:49.360 align:middle line:90%
you're just not going to do it.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So, oh, I'm trying
to grow my company.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to pick you
up at the airport tomorrow.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.710 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to pick the
person up at the airport.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:57.640 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows that.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.290 align:middle line:90%
So, oh, I hope I do it.

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:00.700 align:middle line:90%
I should do that.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.840 align:middle line:84%
All of those are ways
of just not doing it.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you strip
it down, it feels

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.750 align:middle line:84%
really uncomfortable at first
if you say, I am going to do it.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I am doing it.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.910 align:middle line:90%
I am working on doing it.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I am choosing to do it.

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Man, the effect on you at a
very deep level-- it's profound.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And the effect on people
around you-- they look and go,

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.780 align:middle line:90%
that is a man of his word.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:24.370 align:middle line:84%
That is a person
who thought about it

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:26.537 align:middle line:84%
and said something truthful
when it would have maybe

00:47:26.537 --> 00:47:28.990 align:middle line:84%
been more convenient to
say something weaselly.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So you'll find your whole
life shifts if you just

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.460 align:middle line:90%
ditch the weasel words.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.605 align:middle line:84%
All of them are listed
in "Game Changers."

00:47:35.605 --> 00:47:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest thing
is, don't tell yourself

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.130 align:middle line:84%
you need to do anything because,
unless it's life or death,

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:42.130 align:middle line:90%
you don't need to do it.

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.150 align:middle line:90%
You want to do it.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You're choosing to do
it, et cetera, et cetera.

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.890 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling forced
to do it, whatever.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And don't tell yourself
that you can't.

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And don't say things
are impossible.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And you might say, but some
things really are impossible.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I have this conversation
my 8-year-old.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And he says, daddy,
it's impossible to fly

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:03.420 align:middle line:84%
to the middle of the
sun without a spaceship.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:07.096 align:middle line:84%
And I said, change
the laws of physics.

00:48:07.096 --> 00:48:08.830 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, ugh.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to
change the laws of physics.

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:11.997 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you can't change them.

00:48:11.997 --> 00:48:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But until you can show
me that we can't do it,

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.070 align:middle line:84%
it seems highly unlikely and
probably not worth the trouble.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.780 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
honest statement.

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.230 align:middle line:90%
But to say you can't do it--

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.030 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't run faster
than a four-minute mile.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And the minute the first
human did that, within a year,

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.500 align:middle line:90%
everyone was doing it.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:31.227 align:middle line:84%
And now high school
students are doing it,

00:48:31.227 --> 00:48:33.060 align:middle line:84%
because it became
possible when they stopped

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:35.010 align:middle line:90%
saying it was impossible.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.710 align:middle line:84%
When I say, look, I
am actively working

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:41.550 align:middle line:84%
on living to at least 180, and
I actually think it's possible,

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:44.070 align:middle line:84%
well, I am willing
to die trying.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But I want people to
start thinking, maybe

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.520 align:middle line:90%
that's possible for me.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:51.240 align:middle line:84%
What would my life look like
if I'm going to live to 180?

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Will I throw
plastic in the ocean

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.100 align:middle line:84%
now that I'll have to clean up
80 years from now for my liver?

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.880 align:middle line:90%
So just use these words.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And don't use the bad words.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find is
that your life is better.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
one more question.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask
you to tie something in,

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.750 align:middle line:90%
if at all possible.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Give me your big-mission vision
for people listening to this,

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.970 align:middle line:84%
for humanity, what
you want for them.

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And if you can, tie
in how addiction

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:24.200 align:middle line:84%
to a technocratic world, and
computer screens, and all

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the things that we could
be using as a tool or they

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.820 align:middle line:84%
could be used to distract
us from our core purpose

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:29.810 align:middle line:90%
and meaning--

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:32.190 align:middle line:90%
what would you say for people?

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to tie this back
to the Bulletproof mission

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and vision, 'cause I've spent
days and days with my team

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.560 align:middle line:84%
working on, what are the
right words to explain this?

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And the highest and
best manifestation

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:middle line:84%
of that that I have is we
make products and information

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that radically improve
people's lives.

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's part
of it, because you

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.250 align:middle line:84%
want things that actually
make a difference,

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.375 align:middle line:90%
and that little difference.

00:49:54.375 --> 00:49:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And whether you want a higher
return on your meditation,

00:49:56.970 --> 00:49:59.303 align:middle line:84%
you want a higher return on
your diet, on your exercise,

00:49:59.303 --> 00:50:00.978 align:middle line:84%
on anything, you
want it to work.

00:50:00.978 --> 00:50:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want it
to take a long time--

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:90%
so radical change.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we do
that is to help people

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:11.550 align:middle line:84%
tap into the unlimited
power of being human.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And what this means
is that all of us

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.380 align:middle line:84%
have much deeper
levels of abilities,

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.998 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking in the
shamanic things like that,

00:50:18.998 --> 00:50:20.790 align:middle line:84%
our ability to do
something we didn't think

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:23.440 align:middle line:84%
was possible, our ability to
improve our relationships.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, the stuff
that we think is impossible,

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:27.098 align:middle line:90%
you don't know it's impossible.

00:50:27.098 --> 00:50:28.390 align:middle line:90%
And you don't know your limits.

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:30.000 align:middle line:84%
You just think you
know your limits.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's to take that mindset
people say, hey, here

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is the tools, the ones with the
highest return on investment.

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.410 align:middle line:84%
You do this one thing
for five minutes a day,

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:43.650 align:middle line:84%
it's going to give you 2%
more power, 5% more power.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:45.150 align:middle line:90%
How many of those are there?

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.982 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
how many there are.

00:50:46.982 --> 00:50:48.690 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea how
long humans can live.

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:51.720 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what's
possible to boost our IQ.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.280 align:middle line:90%
We have just no idea.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.620 align:middle line:84%
We're just barely
scraping the surface.

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting better
every single year,

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.380 align:middle line:84%
because of technology,
because we have the ability

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to pick up our phone, stick
it in our face, and Google.

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we research
something, we

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:09.660 align:middle line:84%
have more information
at our fingertips

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.050 align:middle line:84%
when we're 11 years old than
the king of the wealthiest

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.890 align:middle line:84%
country on Earth, or the
president, or prime minister,

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.730 align:middle line:90%
or whatever 50 years ago.

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:20.850 align:middle line:84%
You have a level of
research beyond belief.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question is, what
are you going to do with that?

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
do it late at night

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:26.792 align:middle line:84%
with a bright screen on
disrupting your circadian

00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:30.270 align:middle line:84%
biology the way a Nobel Prize
was just awarded [LAUGHS]

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.380 align:middle line:90%
for discovery?

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to use it to just
feel all those weasel words

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I
really need to look

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:37.240 align:middle line:90%
like that person on Instagram?

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.040 align:middle line:90%
I need to do this.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.040 align:middle line:90%
I need to be distracted.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:40.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to pay
attention to the things

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:84%
that I care about
because I allowed myself

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.940 align:middle line:90%
to be distracted.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, you
probably will do that,

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.520 align:middle line:84%
because we've done a
great job of building

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.510 align:middle line:84%
highly addictive
technologies using data.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But now is our chance to
build highly transformative

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.560 align:middle line:84%
technologies doing
data, because we

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.810 align:middle line:84%
have the data about what
addiction and technology does

00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:58.320 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.695 align:middle line:84%
We have the data about what
eating garbage foods that are

00:52:00.695 --> 00:52:02.340 align:middle line:90%
labeled as healthy does for us.

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.580 align:middle line:84%
We have the data about what
communities, and relationships,

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and friends do for us.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.110 align:middle line:84%
We have the data about
what-- from my ring-- sleep

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:10.950 align:middle line:90%
does for me.

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:12.430 align:middle line:90%
We know what gratitude does.

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:13.680 align:middle line:90%
We know what forgiveness does.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.888 align:middle line:90%
We know what meditation does.

00:52:14.888 --> 00:52:16.135 align:middle line:90%
We know what love does.

00:52:16.135 --> 00:52:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure
it all, whether you

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.218 align:middle line:84%
want to do it with
blood chemistry,

00:52:19.218 --> 00:52:21.137 align:middle line:84%
with the variability
of our heartbeats,

00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:23.220 align:middle line:84%
with the way other people's
heartbeats synchronize

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.678 align:middle line:84%
with you when you
walk into a room,

00:52:24.678 --> 00:52:26.940 align:middle line:84%
whether you're in rage mode
or you're in love mode,

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.500 align:middle line:84%
how you affect the
world around you.

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.910 align:middle line:90%
All of that's real.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>> You're a game changer.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the
work that you do.

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I love your addiction
to human betterment

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and looking forward to
what you discover next

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.290 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
elevating the health

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:45.660 align:middle line:90%
and wellness of the human race.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, James.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Keep doing what you're doing--

Food Matters TV,
"Transcendence."

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's helping people take their
screen time and make it matter.

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
highest and best things

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:58.410 align:middle line:90%
that you can do.
