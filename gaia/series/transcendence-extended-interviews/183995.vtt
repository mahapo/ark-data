00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from Food Matters.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm here with none
other than Marie Forleo.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.400 align:middle line:84%
She is an entertainer,
an energizer.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And she is here to help
lighten up your life

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.317 align:middle line:84%
and give you the tools and
tips necessary to make change

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:21.650 align:middle line:84%
in your life and in other
people's lives that you touch.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.918 align:middle line:84%
She is the founder of
"MarieTV," and also B-School.

00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And some of her courses
I've put my team through.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can testify that
this is amazing content.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to you
learning about what

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:90%
she has to share today.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.275 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Marie.

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:35.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you doing?

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm fantastic.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know you
as Marie Forleo,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the TV presenter on "MarieTV,"
hanging out with Oprah all

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:84%
the time, the B-School,
amazing entrepreneur,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:84%
helping people find their
own skills as entrepreneurs.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But what was it like
being Marie growing up?

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:90%
What was your life like?

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you didn't come out
of the womb already like this.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what it was like for you
being a child and growing up.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I was always
interested in a lot of things.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in New Jersey in
a very blue collar family.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:84%
I was actually the first in
my family to go to college.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:90%
So it was a really fun life.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.253 align:middle line:84%
But I remember, every
time people would ask me,

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:18.920 align:middle line:84%
what do you want to
be when you grow up,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:90%
there was never one answer.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:90%
There was 17.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And I always had
a very long list.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And they spanned from being
a teacher, or a dancer,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and a writer, to
business, wanting

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:84%
to be a fine artist,
an animator for Disney,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:90%
a fashion designer--

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:90%
across the spectrum.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
school as an undergrad,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I studied, first, psychology.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I was really
interested in understanding

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
how to have a great life not
only for myself, but also

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:90%
for my family.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So in my history, and in
terms of my familial history,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:90%
mental illness is prevalent.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I saw so much pain
throughout growing up.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.280 align:middle line:90%
My parents got divorced.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And there were all these
issues that happened.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And it always
struck me that they

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:84%
didn't have to be in pain,
that the people that I loved

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
didn't have to experience
that much stress,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that there didn't have to
be these breakages and all

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:90%
of this love just going away.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So when I was
studying psychology,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, I
realized that it wasn't

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
what I wanted to do
in that framework.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I remember the very first
psychology class I took,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I walked into the lecture room,
and the professor at that time

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:84%
was talking about how everything
that's wrong in your life

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
basically stems
from your parents.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, this is BS.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't like this
framework at all.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.993 align:middle line:84%
So I went and I changed
my major on the spot.

00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
The only other thing that
interested me at that time

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:90%
was business.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.130 align:middle line:90%
And so I studied business.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I graduated
from college,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
the only job that
really interested me

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.930 align:middle line:90%
was something that was active.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.945 align:middle line:84%
I was always a human
that had a lot of energy

00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of different
things I wanted to do,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't see myself
sitting behind a desk.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.365 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it was a
little too restrictive.

00:02:57.365 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:90%
It didn't sound exciting.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So I got myself a job on
the New York Stock Exchange,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:84%
on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange, where there is,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
at that time,
literally no seats.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So you're standing all
day long, and people

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.220 align:middle line:84%
are screaming and yelling, and
it's a very exciting, energetic

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:90%
place to work.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was about six
months into that job,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and I started having that
feeling that I think many of us

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
have, where you look around,
and people have success.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
In that particular
form, everyone

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.850 align:middle line:90%
was making millions of dollars.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But while they were
rich financially,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:90%
they were spiritually bankrupt.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
folks that I worked

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.378 align:middle line:84%
with talking about
these two weeks a year

00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:90%
where they would take vacation.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
looked forward to.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't imagine
myself spending

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
decades of my life
only looking forward

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:90%
to two weeks out of the year.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Something felt wrong.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And I started hearing this
small voice inside that said,

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
this isn't what
you're supposed to do.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
This is not where
you're supposed to be.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to
silence that voice,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:84%
because I graduated
from school, first

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:90%
in my family to go to college.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:90%
I had debt.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Quitting this job did not
seem like a rational thing.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
But as time went on, this
little voice inside just

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.320 align:middle line:90%
kept getting louder and louder.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.095 align:middle line:84%
And feeling like I should
be doing something else,

00:04:19.095 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
what that was, and it

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
felt kind of crazy to quit
a job when I didn't have

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:84%
another job lined up or any
clue of what I was supposed

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
to do instead was creating
a lot of stress and anxiety

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I was on the
floor of the exchange,

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and I started getting
a panic attack.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember telling
my boss at the time,

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.863 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go run out
and get a cup of coffee.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, fine,
go get a cup of coffee.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Come right back.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And I left the floor.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And instead of going to get
coffee, I ran to a church.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:90%
I grew up Catholic.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:90%
I went to a Catholic university.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And I sat myself down on
the steps of Trinity Church

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
outside the exchange and
I just started crying,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
know what else to do.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.580 align:middle line:90%
I felt like such a loser.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I felt all of this pressure,
and fear, and uncertainty,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and self-doubt, thinking,
I have this job.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting a steady paycheck.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I should be so grateful
to have this position,

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.987 align:middle line:90%
and all I want to do is quit.

00:05:14.987 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was going to be
a disappointment to my parents

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.463 align:middle line:84%
and to my friends
and to everyone.

00:05:19.463 --> 00:05:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And I remember calling
my dad on my cell phone

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and just bawling my
eyes out and saying,

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Dad, I don't want
to disappoint you,

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.237 align:middle line:90%
but I can't do this anymore.

00:05:26.237 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
the hell I want to do,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
but I've got to
do something else.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said something to me
that forever changed my life.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Marie,
you've worked

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.960 align:middle line:90%
since you were nine years old.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.968 align:middle line:84%
You started babysitting
and selling ice cream

00:05:38.968 --> 00:05:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and working at the beach.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.052 align:middle line:90%
And you've always worked.

00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I'm not worrying
about paying your bills.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.480 align:middle line:84%
He goes, but you have to
find something that you love.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
find that, it's never

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:90%
going to feel like work again.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So as long as it takes you to
try every different thing you

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
could possibly imagine,
you have to keep

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.910 align:middle line:90%
searching until you find it.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you need to quit, I'm
not going to be disappointed.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But you have to do
this and you have

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:90%
to find something you love.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I hung up from
my dad, I remember,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
within the next week, I quit
my job and I went on an odyssey

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
to find what I was meant
to do in the world.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoa.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:90%
What a dad.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%
How lucky are you?

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.010 align:middle line:90%
How many dads would say, what?

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.173 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:06:20.173 --> 00:06:21.090 align:middle line:90%
You're out of control.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:90%
But that's so beautiful.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what I've heard from
people in this sort of path

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
to finding something that gels
more with what they're here

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to do, there's this sense
of, follow your bliss,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.918 align:middle line:84%
follow your joy,
follow what you love.

00:06:35.918 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
When you started
this odyssey and you

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:84%
started to align yourself
with what you are,

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:84%
what started to
happen in your life?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my first step
was really doing a bit

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of an excavation and
asking myself, well,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:90%
what am I really interested in?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:90%
What have I always been good at?

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:90%
What sounds exciting to me?

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Because again, I felt paralyzed.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing that I had
just spent four years studying,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
the epitome of a
job, that wasn't it.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So looking inside, I
really had two clues.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
One was that I was
very interested

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:90%
in the world of business.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.387 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a small
business owner,

00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
so I understood what that was
like, growing up with him.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And the other was
art and creativity.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I had always drawn
and done fine art

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and considered being an
animator for Disney or a fashion

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:90%
designer.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, well,
how do I mesh these two

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.647 align:middle line:84%
passions around business and
small business and something

00:07:22.647 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:90%
around making money?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.130 align:middle line:90%
But also, it has to be creative.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that came to
me was magazine publishing.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:84%
That was the only idea
I could come up with.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
there's a commerce side

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.360 align:middle line:84%
and there's also
a creative side.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So I went to a headhunter,
and I said, I'll do anything.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:90%
I'll be an intern.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll take any level job.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Just get me in the
world of publishing.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And I got into the
ad sales department

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.350 align:middle line:84%
of a magazine called "Gourmet,"
which was part of Conde Nast,

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that very big magazine
publishing company.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And I remember starting
and being so excited.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, oh, this
has got to be it.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was thrilled to be
able to learn the business.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And I had a great boss.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:90%
And I had a great publisher.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were just these
powerful, strong, intelligent

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:90%
women.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But about six
months in, I started

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:90%
hearing that voice again.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It said, Marie, this isn't it.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
no, not this again.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:90%
No, not this again.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wait,
this has to be it.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But as time went on, the
voice got louder and louder.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.160 align:middle line:90%
It said, this isn't it yet.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally got up
the nerve and I said,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to
need to quit this.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And I did a little
bit of an evaluation.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, maybe I'm still too
much on the business side.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Too much commerce,
not enough creativity.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So I wound up going to the
human resources department,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:84%
letting them know, to
see if there was possibly

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.289 align:middle line:84%
a position that was open on the
editorial side of any magazine.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:90%
So they said yes.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.987 align:middle line:84%
They moved me over to
the fashion department

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
at "Mademoiselle," which was
a women's fashion magazine.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, OK,
this has got to be it.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be awesome.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be working
with designers, and up

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.825 align:middle line:84%
and coming new
business owners who

00:08:49.825 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:84%
have great designs
that they want

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:84%
to get in the magazine,
and photographers,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and photo shoots, and
all this kind of stuff.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be awesome.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:90%
So I started doing that job.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.987 align:middle line:84%
And little by little, I heard
that voice creeping up again.

00:09:03.987 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
I have to tell you,

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I really started to
feel a sense of panic.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I started to feel broken.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had a ton
of potential in me.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was a hard worker.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
I knew I wanted to
contribute to the world.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't seem to fit
in to the regular corporate

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.305 align:middle line:84%
So one day I was
on the internet,

00:09:22.305 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
probably when I
shouldn't have been.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And I stumbled upon this
article about a new profession

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.540 align:middle line:90%
at the time called coaching.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is back in 1999.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.390 align:middle line:84%
This is well before coaching
was anything in the mainstream.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
reading this article.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And something in my heart lit
up like nothing ever before.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It really was one of
those moments where

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.980 align:middle line:84%
it feels like the clouds parted
and the Angels were singing

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and sunbeams were
just shooting down.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking to myself.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
The rational part of my
brain said, life coaching--

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:90%
what is that?

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:90%
That sounds so cheesy.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:90%
You're 23 years old.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Who in their right mind is
going to hire a 23-year-old life

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:90%
coach?

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:90%
You haven't even lived life yet.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.610 align:middle line:90%
You can't even hold down a job.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:90%
So I heard all of those voices.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Yet I couldn't
deny that something

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
in my soul, something in my
being felt like this was right.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:84%
This was something
that was more exciting.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:90%
There was something aligned.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
I had to pursue it, even
though it didn't make sense.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So I signed up for a three-year
coach training program,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and I started to do my
studies at night while I kept

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:90%
my magazine job during the day.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
A few months in, I get a
call from the HR department,

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to offer me a
promotion at "Vogue" magazine.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
This was my fork in the road.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you take this
promotion, which

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is more money and more prestige,
a steady paycheck, health

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
benefits, all of the things
that one should want when you're

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
getting start in your
career, or do you

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
quit and do this weird
thing that no one has ever

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
heard of called coaching and
start your own business, which

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea how
to do, and you're

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:84%
carrying thousands and
thousands of debt from college,

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and you have to take
care of yourself?

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:90%
So of course, I quit.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.800 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And I started
bartending and waiting tables

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and doing every odd
job I possibly could.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.065 align:middle line:84%
Because I lived
in New York City,

00:11:10.065 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:84%
which is not an
inexpensive place to live.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And I started working on
my business during the day

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and just hustling my buns
off on nights and weekends

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.260 align:middle line:90%
to fund this brand new business.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
That takes a lot
of guts, and having

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:84%
that insight and that foresight
to know that something

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:90%
will come of this.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
'99 and 2000 until
now-- that's 18 years.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I love too.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.278 align:middle line:84%
When I go to a lot of these
private CEO conferences

00:11:37.278 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and you meet John Mackey,
founder of Whole Foods,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.807 align:middle line:84%
or this guy here who's sold
this many books in not five

00:11:42.807 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:90%
years, three years--

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.870 align:middle line:90%
12, 15 years, 16 years.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:90%
So I love it.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is how long
you've been doing it.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.417 align:middle line:84%
And you've established yourself
as an expert in the space.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.138 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what's happened
in the last 10 years.

00:11:52.138 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I always talk about that it's
not about being an overnight

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:90%
success.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about being an
over-time success.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.517 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you want
to do in this world,

00:11:59.517 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be really
good at your craft,

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be
satisfied, if you

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:84%
want to have a
level of experience,

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:90%
it's going to take time.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.702 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, after 10 years
of really hustling hard,

00:12:11.702 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and making a ton of mistakes,
and doing a lot of work

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:84%
on myself, and consistently
working on my own education,

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:84%
trying to find new ideas and
new ways of doing things,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and putting into practice
everything that I was learning,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I was able to create really
this beautiful business that

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:84%
is completely an
expression of who I am

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and the service that I hope
to provide to the world,

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
to give people very concrete
tools, and ideas, and concepts,

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.088 align:middle line:84%
and introduce them to other
people that can help them

00:12:40.088 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:84%
create a business
and life they love,

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.380 align:middle line:84%
however they define that,
however success looks and feels

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
We have an audience
in 195 countries.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I think we're at maybe 38
million views on YouTube.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to work
with some of my idols,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
like Oprah, or Tony
Robbins, or Richard Branson.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So over the years, I recognized
that one of my greatest

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
abilities was to be able
to communicate with people.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:10.100 align:middle line:90%
I love teaching on video.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.333 align:middle line:84%
I had a part of my career
in health and fitness

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.750 align:middle line:84%
where I was teaching hip-hop,
and I was a Nike elite dance

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:84%
athlete, and I was creating
all these fitness videos.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I loved about that

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:84%
was just being able to talk
to people straight to camera,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.847 align:middle line:84%
and show them how to
do things, and have

00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:84%
them go from feeling
insecure and afraid

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of self-doubt to
this other place of, oh,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.135 align:middle line:90%
my goodness, I can do this.

00:13:29.135 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's
one of my superpowers.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So through our online show,
"MarieTV," every week,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.070 align:middle line:84%
we're creating content
that helps people really

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
take what it is that they
want to do in this world

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and bring it to life.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.520 align:middle line:84%
If there's a change they
want to make in their health,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:84%
or in their relationships,
or in their financial life,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:84%
or in their mental
or emotional health,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:84%
or they want to take this
idea they have for a business

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and grow it, or their
existing business

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and take it to new
heights, a lot of it

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:84%
comes from really simple
tools and the application

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.950 align:middle line:90%
of those tools consistently.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us don't
have voices of encouragement

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that are there, week after week,
guiding you and showing you

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.130 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
do something.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what we try
and do in our company.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to a
teaching, Maria.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:90%
Teach me.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm a willing student.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And so is everyone listening.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's think about
where people are at

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and how we approach
goal-setting.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.743 align:middle line:84%
Because the first step in
personal development is,

00:14:26.743 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:84%
you've got to know
where you want to go.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.610 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get clarity
about where you're at.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.978 align:middle line:84%
And then I've
interviewed people.

00:14:32.978 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:84%
You've probably
interviewed them too.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.603 align:middle line:84%
One gentleman stands out
in particular, Rich Roll.

00:14:36.603 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:90%
He was just living his life.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And he was a lawyer and
doing that sort of stuff.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was 39 and
like, what am I doing?

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.942 align:middle line:84%
People get this sort of wake
up, like you have as well.

00:14:43.942 --> 00:14:46.358 align:middle line:84%
And they realize that maybe
the goals they've been setting

00:14:46.358 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:90%
haven't been true to them.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So how can people tell if
their goals are aligned

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
with what they're here to do,
and if their goals are set out

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.720 align:middle line:84%
of fear or out of
love of service?

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And how do you sort
of coach people

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
through helping set goals and
line up with their purpose?

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the keys to
setting goals that are really

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:84%
going to be incredible for
you is, do they excite you?

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
If you look at them on
that piece of paper,

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.530 align:middle line:90%
does it bring you to light?

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Does it bring you joy?

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Does it make you
have that little mix

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:90%
of fear and anticipation.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait to
dive into them.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
If not, something's
probably wrong.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So if we're setting goals out
of fear or a place of pain,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:90%
that's not necessarily bad.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:84%
We can either change
our lives from a space

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.870 align:middle line:90%
of inspiration or desperation.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us hit a pain
point where we're suffering,

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:90%
we're depressed.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
We have hit this
place in our lives

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
whether it's emotionally, in
a relationship, financially,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.550 align:middle line:84%
in our careers, where
something is not working.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And we find ourselves
feeling like we're beating

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:90%
our head against a wall.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
If you're setting
a goal out of "I

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
can't take this pain anymore,"
that's not necessarily bad,

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
because we have to
start where we are.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
looking at your goals,

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
if they don't make you
want to jump out of bed,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.520 align:middle line:84%
stay up all night,
just get so fired up

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
about figuring out how to
bring them into the world,

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:84%
then I think it's time
for some re-evaluation.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I think there
are goals that people

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:84%
would set that look at them
and go, I need to do that.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Then they're like, I don't
feel like doing it, in a way.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think there's maybe
a little bit of a distinction

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.450 align:middle line:90%
to make here.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.365 align:middle line:84%
There are things that we
have to do, like pay taxes.

00:16:26.365 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] There are
parts of our business

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
or our life that don't
necessarily evoke a ton of joy,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:90%
but we can bring joy to them.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And then if we're looking
at something major,

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:84%
like where we want to live,
or how we want to express

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
ourselves through our
business or career,

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.253 align:middle line:84%
or what we want our
relationship to be like,

00:16:42.253 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:84%
or what we want this body
and our energy to be like,

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
if the vision that we set for
ourself isn't lighting us up

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:84%
on fire, again, it is time to
go back to the drawing board

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and rewrite that story,
rewrite that vision,

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:84%
rewrite those goals so it makes
you want to jump out of bed,

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:84%
so it makes you say, I
cannot wait to tackle this.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of the
struggles that people have--

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:84%
say, they're moving
out of desperation,

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:84%
or they're figuring
their life out,

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.766 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting to
get these aha moments,

00:17:11.766 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:90%
and they're feeling better.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:84%
But then they start
to potentially realize

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
that they've had
limiting beliefs

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:84%
or thoughts about themselves
that have been holding them

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.583 align:middle line:84%
When I first learned
about limiting beliefs,

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:90%
I was like, whoa.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:24.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my goodness.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:84%
I'm riddled with
them, as we all are.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Money doesn't grow on trees,
or you're not smart enough,

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
or you don't have
the connections,

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
or you're not from the
right part of town,

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.068 align:middle line:84%
or you're too black,
or you're too white,

00:17:34.068 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
or you're too this or
that, or your hair's crazy.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We have so many belief
systems that are either

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:84%
set up by our upbringing
or by our culture

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and conditioning that could
be limiting us in a way.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.467 align:middle line:84%
What are your thoughts
on belief systems,

00:17:47.467 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and how can people identify if
they're holding themselves back

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:90%
through that internal language?

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, our beliefs
drive everything, right?

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So our beliefs are really
what drive our actions

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:90%
and our behavior.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And our actions and
behavior drives our destiny.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:90%
So they are paramount.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
They are really those hidden
tracks underneath our lives

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.580 align:middle line:84%
that help us produce the results
that we have or we don't have.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
understanding whether or not

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
we have limiting
beliefs, one clue

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.260 align:middle line:84%
is to see if there's a
recurring pattern in your life.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:84%
If there's something that
you say that you want,

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a reality for
you, and it's been true

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.482 align:middle line:84%
for years and years and years,
or even months and months

00:18:26.482 --> 00:18:27.940 align:middle line:84%
and months, and
you've been working

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
on it, that's probably
a clue that there could

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
be a limiting belief
under there that you

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%
need to investigate and then
consciously work on changing.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
So I think, when it comes
to limiting beliefs,

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.670 align:middle line:84%
if there's any area in your
life that consistently creates

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.082 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pain, a lot of stress,
a lot of struggle or anxiety,

00:18:46.082 --> 00:18:48.040 align:middle line:84%
it's a good place to peek
around and say, well,

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:90%
what do I believe about this?

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Do I believe that it's
possible to resolve?

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Do I believe I'm worthy
of having this resolved?

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I think investigating it on that
level from a place of curiosity

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:90%
is step one.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're not
aware of the belief,

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to change it.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any personal
limiting beliefs

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that you had that you now
have a different thing about?

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, I know that you
have a belief that everything

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.465 align:middle line:90%
is "figure-outtable."

00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> "Figure-outtable."

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>> "Figure-outtable."

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And I have a belief that
I've developed over time

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:84%
that everything is absolutely
always unfolding perfectly.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.175 align:middle line:84%
There is some perfection
in everything,

00:19:23.175 --> 00:19:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and then you seek
to ask questions

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:90%
to discover that perfection.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So give me an example
of you personally.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.760 align:middle line:84%
What are some
beliefs that you had

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.628 align:middle line:84%
that you've had to potentially
evolve to or upgrade to?

00:19:33.628 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Or tell me about some of the
beliefs that you currently

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
have, like that everything
is "figure-outtable,"

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and how that's helped you
in times of challenge.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>> For most of my life, I had a
lot of limiting beliefs around

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And that comes from my family.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:90%
My mom grew up in poverty.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.275 align:middle line:84%
And her entire
experience of life

00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:84%
was, money doesn't
grow on trees.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember,
from the time

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
I was very small all the way
up through when I was an adult,

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:84%
there was never enough
when it came to money.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that that
was what I was steeped in.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But there was
another part with me,

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:84%
from starting to learn and
understand how the world works,

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.270 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't always true.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And I felt in my
bones that there

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.230 align:middle line:84%
was more than
enough to go around,

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.535 align:middle line:84%
but my checkbook
didn't reflect that.

00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was
starting my business,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember it was
in the early days.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.647 align:middle line:84%
And going to write those
checks to pay rent every month,

00:20:25.647 --> 00:20:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I would get nervous,
because sometimes there

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.313 align:middle line:90%
wasn't enough there.

00:20:28.313 --> 00:20:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But I was so committed
to growing this business

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and breaking out of
this limiting belief.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:90%
And I've realized one thing--

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:84%
that if I kept
behaving in the way

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that I always
behaved in the past,

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.510 align:middle line:90%
nothing was going to change.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So I thought to myself, what
if I start changing my behavior

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than working
on the belief?

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I did.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a coaching
program coming up

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
where it was a group
coaching program

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
and I was about to open up the
doors to have people come in.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And again, this was
at a point in my life

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
where money was
still very scarce

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
still touch-and-go.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:90%
And I made a promise to myself.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I said, I've always
wanted my business

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to be about more than just
me, more than just profits

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:90%
for my own bank account.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really care that
much about material things.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to make a
difference beyond me.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:84%
But how do I figure
out this money thing?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:84%
No matter how many people come
into this coaching program,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I am going to make a commitment
to myself and to the universe

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to give
away 10% of the profits,

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:90%
no matter what it was.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:84%
The logical part of
my mind was screaming.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't even
pay your own rent.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:33.060 align:middle line:90%
This is nuts.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.793 align:middle line:84%
This is not even a
wise business move.

00:21:34.793 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:84%
How can you even
claim that you're

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
a businessperson or a
life coach if you're

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
doing something so silly?

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Yet my heart knew it was
the right move to do.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So I made that commitment,
opened the doors.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:90%
People came through.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
just going to trust.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is left at the
end, we're going to do this.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.820 align:middle line:90%
So everyone came to the program.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And that amount turned
out to be about $7,000,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.720 align:middle line:84%
which was way more than I
even had in my bank account

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:90%
starting this whole crazy idea.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of giving that
away got me so excited.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know who I
was going to give it to.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking around
for an organization

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
that I felt like would be
a good fit with my values.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been an advocate
for empowering girls and women.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:84%
It turns out there was a UN
initiative that was starting up

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.050 align:middle line:90%
called Girl Up.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was all
about taking a look

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
at how many girls around the
world are denied an education

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and doing what we can to
get them back in school.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.283 align:middle line:84%
I had gotten in touch with
the director of that program.

00:22:33.283 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And she said, hey, we're having
a launch party in New York

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:35.940 align:middle line:90%
City.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to come?

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:37.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I would love to.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, by the way, I'd
like to make a donation.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
this is incredible.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.560 align:middle line:84%
I always had a
dream of having one

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
of those big,
cheesy, large checks

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and being able to give
it to someone else.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, would you mind if
I presented you with a check,

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:90%
like a big one?

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.250 align:middle line:84%
She's like, that
would be amazing.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:90%
So I went to FedEx.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:84%
I got this big,
cheesy check drawn up.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I remember going on stage,
and I just started bawling.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I couldn't believe
that it was a mere eight

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.060 align:middle line:84%
weeks ago that I didn't
know if I was going

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:90%
to be able to pay my own rent.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And here I was, being able
to present a check that was

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
$7,000-plus to a group of young
girls who needed it way more

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.790 align:middle line:90%
than I ever would.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I got on stage,
presented the check.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I walked off stage, and
someone came up to me,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and they said Marie,
that was incredible.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear more about your
work and what you're doing.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, thank you.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.410 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I work
for Richard Branson.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're about to do a
trip with entrepreneurs

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to South Africa with
him and we would

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.220 align:middle line:90%
love to invite you to come.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.020 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I started jumping up and down in
my heels right then and there.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Because he was always
one of my business idols.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was someone who
I had always looked

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
to that embodied such
creativity and such an ability

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.660 align:middle line:84%
to bring joy and purpose
to all of his businesses.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that,
by following my heart

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and what I knew
to be true, which

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
was that there was more
than enough to go around,

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:84%
not just for me,
but for others, it

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:84%
triggered this
domino effect of me

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:84%
shifting my own limiting
belief around money.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
That was actually the beginning
of my business starting

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:90%
to take off.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And then it enabled me
to interact with and meet

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
so many other people
on this journey that

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.847 align:middle line:84%
could inspire me to
continue to grow,

00:24:23.847 --> 00:24:25.680 align:middle line:84%
in terms of my generosity
and the difference

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.390 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to make.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's freaking awesome.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:90%
It's so cool.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:84%
It's so cool when you prove
yourself wrong in ways.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:90%
You're like, oh, my god.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.773 align:middle line:90%
I was totally wrong.

00:24:33.773 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:90%
This is the best thing ever.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that there's
something in that ability

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.653 align:middle line:84%
to give that shows you
that you have so much

00:24:40.653 --> 00:24:41.820 align:middle line:90%
more than you could imagine?

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that,
in terms of how

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to change a limiting belief,
it's less about the psychology,

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
from my point of view, and
it's more about really flipping

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:90%
old wisdom on its head.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So most of us have heard
the process of creation.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So we have thought,
then we have word,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:90%
then we have deed or action.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how things
usually come to life.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.127 align:middle line:84%
But when you want to
change a limiting belief,

00:25:05.127 --> 00:25:07.790 align:middle line:84%
you have to flip that
formula and make it reverse.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
You act first, then
you speak in alliance

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.570 align:middle line:90%
with how you want to behave.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And then your beliefs changed.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's this really
cool, interesting, very

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.212 align:middle line:84%
action-oriented way
to sidestep all of the

00:25:22.212 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:84%
"oh, my gosh, I have so
many limiting beliefs,"

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.820 align:middle line:90%
and get right to changing them.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So in short, if you think you
don't have enough money or you

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
have a limiting belief around
money, go give some away.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.353 align:middle line:90%
Speak with that.

00:25:33.353 --> 00:25:36.020 align:middle line:84%
There's enough to go around, and
I've proven it with my actions.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.937 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
your beliefs change.

00:25:37.937 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You do that enough and you
will absolutely change that

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:90%
belief.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So one of my mantras that I've
lived by ever since I realized

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that limiting
beliefs around money

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:84%
were really holding me back
was, there's always more

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.250 align:middle line:90%
where that came from.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So every single time,
still, when I write a check,

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.250 align:middle line:84%
or I pay a bill, or
I make a donation,

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:84%
or whatever I have to do
that is in terms of outflow,

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:84%
there is always more
where that came from.

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And you do that enough,
and it absolutely

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:90%
becomes your reality.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I am one of the most
pragmatic, practical people

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.900 align:middle line:90%
you will ever meet.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this isn't
about just saying it

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:90%
and it will become true.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And there are maybe
people that believe that,

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:90%
and I honor and respect it.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I'm a very
brass tacks kind of girl.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So it is about aligning
your actions in a way that's

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:84%
appropriate with your
life at this moment,

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.465 align:middle line:84%
and then changing your
reality from that place.

00:26:26.465 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.540 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:84%
My dad's thing was
that he was unwell.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:90%
That's why I made food matter.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And we found this real passion
in studying food and nutrition.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:84%
With my dad getting
well, he was sick,

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and he believed that only
the medical profession could

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.030 align:middle line:84%
save him, and that if he took
these drugs, he would get well.

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't believe his body
had an innate healing capacity.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
He didn't believe that,
until it was knowledge

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:90%
that helped him unlock that.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And do you think,
through knowledge,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.415 align:middle line:84%
you can also learn
to move beliefs?

00:26:58.415 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Because he thought, oh,
I need to take pills.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I need to listen to doctors.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Then he saw this
information about Prozac

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and how it was causing
suicidal side effects.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:90%
It's really dangerous.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:90%
He was like, this is wrong.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:07.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get off it.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the other
most powerful ways that we can

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.490 align:middle line:84%
change limiting beliefs is
through finding evidence

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to the contrary-- so actively
looking for what else might be

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.590 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.307 align:middle line:84%
In the example of
limiting money beliefs,

00:27:20.307 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:84%
well, if you're
struggling with money,

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:84%
but other people aren't,
recognizing, OK, well,

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
maybe they've figured out
something that I haven't yet.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So let me go collect all
the evidence of other people

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:84%
that disprove this
limiting belief.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
It could be the same
thing around health--

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.070 align:middle line:84%
actively, proactively
searching out

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and creating a whole stack
of evidence to the contrary

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, how
we can also start

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.583 align:middle line:84%
to begin to change some
of those negative beliefs,

00:27:44.583 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
just like what you were
saying with your dad.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:51.205 align:middle line:84%
>> So I keep forgetting how
many people have shot this film.

00:27:51.205 --> 00:27:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You know Brendon
Burchard, right?

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> He just talks
like he's a script.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.750 align:middle line:84%
He's just like, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:90%
He's great.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
a few funny things.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.698 align:middle line:84%
First of all, 86% of people
in the morning wake up

00:28:02.698 --> 00:28:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing they
do is check their phone.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And then they're reacting
to the whole world all day.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's death, pain, fire,
destruction, obviously,

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:90%
on the News.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.028 align:middle line:84%
But then the other
thing is that we

00:28:11.028 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:84%
got tricked into thinking
in the '80s and '90s

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.860 align:middle line:84%
that material possessions are
going to bring us happiness.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we've structured
our entire lives

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.337 align:middle line:84%
around amassing
material possessions.

00:28:21.337 --> 00:28:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got 30, 40
million people in the US

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:90%
on Prozac.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on, Marie?

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a
couple of things.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the role that
the media plays in our lives,

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.610 align:middle line:84%
how many advertising messages
we're all bombarded with--

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and most of them are
telling us that we need

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:90%
additional material things.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.480 align:middle line:84%
We need to buy this
app, or this technology,

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
or this new pair of shoes,
or whatever it is in order

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.110 align:middle line:90%
to feel a sense of happiness.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it has just
been conditioned into us

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:90%
in our society over time.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And you look around and you
see other people wanting

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:90%
to keep up with the Joneses.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:84%
We're social
creatures by nature.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:84%
We look around and we're
influenced by social proof.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So if everyone else
is doing those things,

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that's part of where
the problem comes from.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.323 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of looking at the
state of society right now,

00:29:11.323 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the biggest
things we have to look at

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:15.950 align:middle line:84%
is how addicted we
are to our screens

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and how much we've given control
over to technology, thinking

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:84%
about how often we're looking
at our phones, how many times.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.618 align:middle line:84%
I think it's up to 150
per day at a minimum

00:29:25.618 --> 00:29:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that people are picking up their
phones and checking on them.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And all we're doing
is giving away

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:84%
our time, our power,
and our attention.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:84%
There's no connection in
there with a real human being.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
There's no connection
with nature.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.425 align:middle line:84%
We're losing connection with
our own body, our vessel,

00:29:39.425 --> 00:29:42.800 align:middle line:84%
all of the wisdom inside
that tells us whether or not

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
we're on track or
we're off track.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Because, again, we're
screen-sucking so much

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:90%
of the time.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:53.572 align:middle line:84%
So apart from materialism, I
think so much of the problem,

00:29:53.572 --> 00:29:55.280 align:middle line:84%
at least right now--
and it will probably

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
continue-- is how
much time we're

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:84%
spending looking at our
phones and looking at screens.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
We weren't designed
to live this way.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So many of us live
these sedentary lives.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.766 align:middle line:84%
We're staring at a screen--
what-- eight, nine,

00:30:05.766 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:84%
12 hours a day,
spending hardly any time

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:84%
in nature, very little
time with our loved ones.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:84%
Even when we are
having a dinner,

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.620 align:middle line:84%
how many times are kids
either on their iPads

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:90%
or looking at phones?

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's checking
texts and Instagram

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and all social media.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:84%
All of that is leaving
us feeling so empty.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing
is reaching for things,

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
whether it's material things,
or food, or anything else

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:90%
to try and fill up these holes.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we're lacking presence,
and we're lacking connection,

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.661 align:middle line:84%
and we're lacking the sense
that we actually matter.

00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you sound
like a preacher.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.040 align:middle line:84%
So I know you've got a
Catholic upbringing, as have I.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've since branched off
into other more esoteric things

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.852 align:middle line:84%
in order to delve deeper into
what the hell's going on.

00:30:47.852 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's all the same really.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So you brought up an
interesting point there,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.058 align:middle line:84%
that we're lacking the
sense of connection to self.

00:30:55.058 --> 00:30:56.600 align:middle line:84%
We're lacking the
sense of connection

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.450 align:middle line:84%
to the greater self,
which is really

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:84%
mother nature and the
community, the universe.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:03.867 align:middle line:90%
How do people get that back?

00:31:03.867 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And how important is it to
have that connection in terms

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
of being aligned with
what you're here to do.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Having a connection
to ourselves,

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:84%
having a connection
to other humans,

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and having a
connection to nature

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:84%
is paramount to
discovering why you're here

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.810 align:middle line:84%
and living a joyful
and fulfilled life.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
We have so much happening, so
much wisdom in these bodies.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.250 align:middle line:84%
All of our intuition
lives in there.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:84%
All of our creativity
lives in our body.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And if we deaden it because
we're living from the neck up,

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're constantly
just in these screens,

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.720 align:middle line:84%
we're missing out on
the joy, and the beauty,

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and the passion, and the energy
of what this life is about.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So part of what we need to
do is understand that we're

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.560 align:middle line:90%
in control, not these phones.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need a bit of a
wake-up call to recognize that,

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.070 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to apps, when
it comes to social media, when

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.800 align:middle line:84%
it comes to many of the things
that we are volunteering

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.890 align:middle line:84%
our time and our life away
through, that we are not

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.420 align:middle line:90%
the client of these apps.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:90%
We are the product.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
The more of our
time and attention

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:84%
that we spend, their
stock prices go up.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's not in our
best interest to think

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.880 align:middle line:90%
that they're serving us.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:84%
We actually have to turn
these things off and get back

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:17.660 align:middle line:90%
to basics.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that when
people start to actually

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:84%
move their bodies
more, whether it's

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:84%
through dance,
through working out,

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:84%
through yoga, whatever
it is that turns them on,

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.550 align:middle line:84%
that's when you open up
that channel of creativity.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:84%
That's where you tap
into your internal wisdom

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:84%
about what you should
do next, about how

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to solve that thorny problem,
whether it's in your marriage,

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or with your kids,
or with a co-worker.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.180 align:middle line:84%
That's when you start to get
back into control of your life

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.407 align:middle line:84%
and start to feel that energy
that you need to really live

00:32:44.407 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:84%
into your purpose and make
the difference that you

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.375 align:middle line:90%
were born to make.

00:32:48.375 --> 00:32:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the best grab
you've ever given in your life.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.875 align:middle line:90%
I think that was awesome.

00:32:51.875 --> 00:32:54.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] That was really good.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.170 align:middle line:90%
That was really amazing.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, break this down
practically for me.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Marie, what do you
do personally to try

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.280 align:middle line:84%
to keep that sense of body
intuition with yourself?

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Is it like, you wake up and
try to be still or think

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:84%
about what I want
to manifest today

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:12.500 align:middle line:84%
or the feelings I want to have
today, or I write stuff down,

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.690 align:middle line:84%
or I always move my body,
or I do breath work?

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.027 align:middle line:84%
What's Marie's
practical sort of way

00:33:17.027 --> 00:33:19.360 align:middle line:84%
of tapping into that inner
wisdom or that intuition look

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:90%
like?

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So for me, there are a few
things that are non-negotiable.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I know that if
they are not a part

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.940 align:middle line:84%
of my regular daily
activity that I'm

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.320 align:middle line:84%
going to be falling
off the wagon

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.987 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to
be feeling so good.

00:33:31.987 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:84%
One of those things
is meditation.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:90%
So for me, it's TM.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It is so practical, so
transformative, so powerful.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And there is so much science
behind why it transforms us

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:48.405 align:middle line:84%
physiologically,
psychologically, emotionally.

00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
hundreds and hundreds

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.330 align:middle line:84%
of peer-reviewed research papers
that people can go and Google.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's phenomenal.

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So meditation for
me twice a day.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Also, exercise-- I think it's
one of the most underrated ways

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.270 align:middle line:84%
to change your psychology
and your physiology

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and your emotional well-being.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Any time that I find myself
really frustrated or anytime

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.370 align:middle line:84%
I find myself blocked,
I get into the gym.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.978 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's
taking a spin class.

00:34:14.978 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's
taking a dance class.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's
just taking a walk.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But getting out of my head and
getting into my body, again,

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.870 align:middle line:84%
opens up this enormous channel
of wisdom that I cannot access

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.040 align:middle line:90%
any other way.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.150 align:middle line:84%
So movement at least 15 20
minutes if not an hour a day,

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:84%
some type of intensity,
that, for me, keeps me sane.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.449 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's about
what we put in our bodies.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.429 align:middle line:90%
It's about the food that we eat.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:41.409 align:middle line:90%
I'm Italian-American.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in New Jersey.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I love pasta like
the next person.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.580 align:middle line:90%
You have no idea.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:84%
But I have discovered through
lots of trial and error,

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:54.659 align:middle line:84%
when I eat certain foods,
do I feel alert or not?

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Do I feel cranky?

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.080 align:middle line:90%
Do I get brain fog?

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And I have begun to create
a nutritional lifestyle

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
for myself where
I'm eating to fuel

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.140 align:middle line:84%
my emotional well-being,
and my intelligence,

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and my cognition, rather
than my historical past

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:90%
and what those cravings Are

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Gorgeous.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.220 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.020 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about intuition.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.483 align:middle line:90%
What the hell is intuition?

00:35:17.483 --> 00:35:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you say you
listen to your intuition,

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:90%
it sounds so ethereal.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So how do people know if
something is intuition or fear?

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And how would you
describe intuition?

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So for me, intuition is
just our internal wisdom.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It's this natural knowing
that each of us have

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that oftentimes we're
never listening to.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the benefits
that I had was,

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:84%
my mom trained me, ever
since I was little,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
to listen to the still,
small voice inside.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And she said you
will always know

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.770 align:middle line:84%
the right move to make if you
tap inside and you listen.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:90%
There will always be an answer.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So I heard this message
over and over again.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So whenever in my adult life
I'm wondering which way to go,

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:90%
I get quiet.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And I pay attention to what's
happening on the inside,

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.480 align:middle line:90%
whether I actually hear a voice.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Or one of the most useful tests
for me is, I do something,

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and I figure out whether or not
I feel expansive or contracted.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.090 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I mean.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:09.320 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times
people ask me, well,

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Marie, how do I know the
difference between fear

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.200 align:middle line:90%
and intuition?

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Is this something
that I should do,

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.415 align:middle line:84%
and maybe I'm just
feeling butterflies,

00:36:15.415 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:84%
or is this my intuition saying,
no, don't do that, this is bad?

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you need to do.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.840 align:middle line:84%
You need to imagine yourself
moving ahead with whatever

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.010 align:middle line:90%
you're considering.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.190 align:middle line:84%
You start to tap in on a
very subtle level and see,

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:32.270 align:middle line:84%
do you feel yourself
expansive, like everything

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is either moving forward or
getting brighter or lighter,

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.740 align:middle line:84%
or, on a very subtle level,
is everything contracting,

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.090 align:middle line:90%
meaning it feels heavy?

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:42.950 align:middle line:84%
You feel a subtle
sense of dread.

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, we're talking
microscopic levels.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you just ask yourself
that question, how do I

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.140 align:middle line:84%
feel imagining moving
ahead with this,

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and you pay enough
attention, you

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.627 align:middle line:84%
will either feel yourself
pulling back or moving forward.

00:36:55.627 --> 00:36:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And nine times out
of 10, that's going

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:90%
to give you the best answer.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, if it
feels contracted,

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.560 align:middle line:84%
or it feels heavy or dread,
that's your intuition

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.942 align:middle line:90%
telling you, don't go.

00:37:04.942 --> 00:37:06.650 align:middle line:84%
If it still feels
scary, and you're like,

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.775 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I can do
this, but everything feels

00:37:08.775 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:90%
like it's coming alive, do it.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.577 align:middle line:90%
That's a yes.

00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It's almost that.

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:84%
If it feels fun,
it feels exciting,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.210 align:middle line:84%
if you feel drawn to it in a
way without that sense of fear

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.640 align:middle line:90%
or contraction, then it's a yes.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And you know, something
can be really uncertain.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.047 align:middle line:84%
You might not be
able to decide, I

00:37:26.047 --> 00:37:27.630 align:middle line:84%
don't know if I'll
be able to do this.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:29.422 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
good enough to do this.

00:37:29.422 --> 00:37:31.080 align:middle line:90%
But it still feels really fun.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.480 align:middle line:84%
That's a clear
sign to go for it.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:84%
There's real
opportunity for growth.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of the beliefs that
drives my whole life is,

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:90%
everything is "figure-outtable."

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:84%
If there's something
that you want to do,

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.922 align:middle line:84%
or there's something that
you want to experience,

00:37:42.922 --> 00:37:44.480 align:middle line:84%
or something that
you want to change,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.250 align:middle line:84%
you can absolutely
figure it out.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.493 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
have all of the hows.

00:37:48.493 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
all of the information.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.380 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to know if
it'll actually turn out right.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.125 align:middle line:84%
But you have to take
that first step.

00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
other things that can really

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:01.300 align:middle line:84%
help us is an idea that
clarity comes from engagement,

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.680 align:middle line:90%
not thought.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
inkling that you

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.380 align:middle line:84%
might want to pursue
a particular career

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:84%
or maybe start a business
or try a new path,

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.020 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to quit your
job and just go for it.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.740 align:middle line:84%
See if there's a small way that
you can test or experiment.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Can you take a class?

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Can you volunteer for a day?

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Can you go engage in whatever
that possibility is so that you

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.550 align:middle line:84%
can feel from your body
and from the world,

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.480 align:middle line:90%
does this feel right?

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Is this exciting?

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Do I want to keep
going, or was this

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.417 align:middle line:84%
just an idea that I'm really
glad that I did this day

00:38:34.417 --> 00:38:36.250 align:middle line:84%
or I did this experiment,
but you know what?

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
change my whole life.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I think, so many times,
we can sit on a couch

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.190 align:middle line:84%
and think about how
we want our life

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to possibly change, or imagine
starting that business,

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.370 align:middle line:84%
or imagine moving to that
place, without realizing

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:52.000 align:middle line:84%
that, if we can just
engage in some small way,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:90%
we'll get the information.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.510 align:middle line:84%
We'll feel whether or
not we should move ahead.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And that will inform
our next step.

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's two schools
of thought on that.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a "take massive action"
thought, which is just like,

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:90%
screw it, just go for it.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.377 align:middle line:84%
And I've done that
before, and it's fun.

00:39:07.377 --> 00:39:08.180 align:middle line:90%
I quite enjoy it.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I love uncertainty.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that travels with me,
they know that I just dig it.

00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Where are we staying tonight?

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:14.290 align:middle line:90%
No idea.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going next?

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of play
with certainty.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a lot of
certainly in my life, and I

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of uncertainty.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of play that.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But then you're
saying there's also

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.500 align:middle line:84%
this track of, take
some baby steps.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.300 align:middle line:90%
See how it feels.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And start to develop,
is this feeling right?

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Is this where I'm going next?

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's contextual.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.820 align:middle line:84%
For some of us, we have a lot of
responsibilities in our lives.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
We have people that
are depending on us.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.730 align:middle line:84%
We have parents that
we're taking care of.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:38.530 align:middle line:90%
We have children.

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:39.330 align:middle line:90%
We have pets.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.490 align:middle line:84%
We have people that depend
on us for their well-being.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of just uprooting
everything and making

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.953 align:middle line:84%
a huge change might
not be practical.

00:39:47.953 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:90%
It might not be responsible.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It might create
more stress that's

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.110 align:middle line:84%
not actually conducive to the
change that you want to make.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the
case, that doesn't

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.870 align:middle line:84%
mean that you can't
change your life.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.953 align:middle line:84%
That just means that you
have to be more creative.

00:39:57.953 --> 00:40:01.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to find a way to engage
and experiment and test things,

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.310 align:middle line:84%
whether it's late at night,
early in the mornings,

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.360 align:middle line:90%
on the weekends.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.235 align:middle line:84%
And then you can start
to create change.

00:40:06.235 --> 00:40:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are
built differently.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Some of us do need
to burn the bridges.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of us need
to say, that's it.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm changing
everything right now.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I think the point
is, there's not one

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.030 align:middle line:84%
right way, that if you are that
person who just needs to do it

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:84%
all in one fell swoop and
that feels most exciting to,

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:23.290 align:middle line:90%
rock on.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you're someone who's
a little more risk-averse

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.802 align:middle line:84%
and you want to test
things out, don't

00:40:27.802 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:84%
think that you're
not going to have

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:33.130 align:middle line:84%
a huge transformation because
you take small steps over time.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And within a year, three
years, five years, or 10 years,

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:84%
you can have a completely
different existence

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and look back and
go, thank goodness

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.080 align:middle line:90%
I took that first step.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> So cool.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And I want to just jump
to some practicality here.

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the big
things that you teach

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:84%
is tools about how people
can create something online

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:53.770 align:middle line:90%
in a relatively easy way.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I've been 10 years in
internet marketing and that.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.227 align:middle line:84%
And it's brilliant
and super smart.

00:41:00.227 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:84%
But it's great for people
that are just like, I'm stuck.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.640 align:middle line:90%
I want to start.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.720 align:middle line:90%
How do I start?

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.658 align:middle line:90%
Is it content?

00:41:05.658 --> 00:41:06.700 align:middle line:90%
How do I start with copy?

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.880 align:middle line:90%
How do I start with this?

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.680 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular era
that we live in right now,

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Marie, there's so much that
people can do two hours

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:90%
a night, separate to their job.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Kids are asleep.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Pets are whatever they
do with them-- fed or put

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.532 align:middle line:90%
in their little beds.

00:41:21.532 --> 00:41:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Then they can do
two hours of work.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.640 align:middle line:84%
What are some real,
practical things

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.015 align:middle line:84%
people can do in
this day and age

00:41:26.015 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to start putting their
purpose and mission

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.765 align:middle line:84%
and fulfillment projects
out into the world?

00:41:31.765 --> 00:41:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a couple of ways
that I talk about this.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things that I think

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.510 align:middle line:84%
that we do to stop
ourselves when it comes

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to putting our mission
out into the world,

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.552 align:middle line:84%
to doing work that really
matters, to changing our life

00:41:43.552 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is, we feel like we have
to have it all figured out

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and we have to do some
big, massive change.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.670 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
we fail to realize

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:55.100 align:middle line:84%
is that how we do anything is
almost as important as what

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:55.900 align:middle line:90%
we're doing.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.460 align:middle line:90%
So what do I mean by that?

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
You can start activating your
purpose in the exact life

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.560 align:middle line:90%
that you have right now--

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.540 align:middle line:84%
how you're showing up
at the breakfast table,

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.502 align:middle line:84%
how you're showing up
at your existing job,

00:42:06.502 --> 00:42:08.710 align:middle line:84%
how you're engaging with
people at the grocery store,

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:09.820 align:middle line:90%
on the bank line.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.600 align:middle line:90%
You can embody your purpose.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.490 align:middle line:84%
If you want to make a
difference to others,

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.073 align:middle line:84%
then start making a difference
with the energy that you bring.

00:42:16.073 --> 00:42:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Your attitude is so
incredibly important

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:22.630 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how you
make people feel.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I'll walk
around in this world

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.680 align:middle line:84%
and I see people that
will come into my work

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, but I really
want to empower women,

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.500 align:middle line:84%
or I really want to empower
this group of people.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.895 align:middle line:84%
But all day long,
they're complaining.

00:42:34.895 --> 00:42:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
women around them,

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
actually empowering them

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:39.730 align:middle line:84%
through their energy
or their attitude.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:41.188 align:middle line:84%
So I think one of
the things that's

00:42:41.188 --> 00:42:43.240 align:middle line:84%
really important
before getting even

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.460 align:middle line:84%
to some of the tactical
things that we can do

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.390 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing that every
single moment we're alive,

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:90%
we are making a difference.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us whether
we're living into that purpose

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:84%
or making that positive
difference or not.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So attitude and energy is
always the first place to look.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the 24 hours
you're alive every day are

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.470 align:middle line:84%
24 hours that you
have an opportunity

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:90%
to make a positive difference.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes to
using these pockets of time

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.940 align:middle line:84%
to create a business or
to launch a new career,

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.950 align:middle line:84%
I think getting really
clear on whatever

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:16.920 align:middle line:84%
it is that you're trying to do
is obviously step number one--

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.540 align:middle line:84%
talking about,
what is the vision?

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.100 align:middle line:84%
What are we working
towards here?

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So you understand how to create
a game plan to reverse engineer

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:90%
bringing it to life.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.170 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to making
a difference in the world

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and using our gift
to create change,

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.090 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes, we think we
have to change everything,

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:35.673 align:middle line:84%
and we need a new career, and
we need to start a new business.

00:43:35.673 --> 00:43:37.470 align:middle line:90%
But that's not always the truth.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.390 align:middle line:84%
The energy and the
attitude that we

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:43.140 align:middle line:84%
bring to every single
moment of our day counts.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And that energy
and that attitude

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.650 align:middle line:90%
can create such a ripple effect.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
infamous Gandhi quote.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.145 align:middle line:84%
Be the change that you
want to see in the world.

00:43:52.145 --> 00:43:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Visualization, Novak used
it, Stig used it, Wynn used it,

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.090 align:middle line:90%
imagining what they want to do.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But you were talking
about, there's a plan.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Creating a plan is
almost as important.

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Having a vision for what
you want to create is vital.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to say
that not all of us

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.840 align:middle line:84%
can have that crystal clear
vision, especially when we're

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.270 align:middle line:84%
starting out and things
are a little murky.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But even if we do
have a vision, I

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:84%
think what's equally-- if not
more-- important is having

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.520 align:middle line:84%
a plan to bring it to life, to
make sure that it's not just

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.860 align:middle line:84%
something that you're looking
at on a vision board, that

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.310 align:middle line:84%
every single day, you're
executing on effective steps

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.360 align:middle line:90%
to bring it to life.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that I do myself

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:34.920 align:middle line:84%
that I advise anyone
who wants to bring

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:84%
a big vision alive to do is
take four to five minutes

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:84%
at the end of your day and
write down exactly what you're

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.510 align:middle line:90%
going to do the following day--

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:45.930 align:middle line:84%
looking at your appointments,
looking at any special projects

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.810 align:middle line:84%
that you know must get done
to bring that vision to life,

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and even mapping out
things like working out,

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:84%
meditation time,
any of the self-care

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.650 align:middle line:84%
practices that you
know that you need

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:58.170 align:middle line:90%
to do in order to be your best.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It sounds so simple, but
so many people don't do it.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.170 align:middle line:84%
They don't go, OK,
well, you know what?

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:84%
If I really do want to
fit in that meditation,

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.510 align:middle line:84%
or that 15-minute workout,
or 10 minutes of prayer,

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and I need to feed the kids,
and I need to walk the dog,

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.550 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to need
to wake up, whether it's

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:16.890 align:middle line:90%
5:30 or 6:00 or 7:00 AM.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:20.130 align:middle line:84%
If I need to get x amount of
writing done to eventually get

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.940 align:middle line:84%
my book done, I need to
block out this chunk of time.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Taking four to five minutes
to do that the night before

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.310 align:middle line:84%
has such an extraordinarily
transformative effect.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.780 align:middle line:90%
And here's the second piece.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I like to say, if it's not
scheduled, it's not real--

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.607 align:middle line:84%
so popping all of those
different tasks with time

00:45:36.607 --> 00:45:38.940 align:middle line:84%
estimates into your calendar
and-- here's the piece that

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.140 align:middle line:90%
most people miss--

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.480 align:middle line:90%
where you're going to do it.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So studies have shown that you
can increase from two to three

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.910 align:middle line:84%
times the likelihood
that you will actually

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.210 align:middle line:84%
complete a task if you not only
say when you're going to do it,

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.590 align:middle line:90%
but the physical place.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.517 align:middle line:84%
Is this going to happen
at your kitchen table?

00:45:54.517 --> 00:45:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to work out at
the gym or in your bedroom?

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to actually
create that business plan

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.390 align:middle line:90%
at the library?

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So a few little steps
like that every single day

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:08.880 align:middle line:84%
can help you actually take that
vision and concretely put it

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.840 align:middle line:90%
into life.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.440 align:middle line:90%
So practical.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.320 align:middle line:90%
So Marie, really.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's be honest.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.830 align:middle line:90%
So pragmatic Marie.

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:17.580 align:middle line:84%
One thing I think
that's a little bit open

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.210 align:middle line:90%
is, you touched on TM.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.005 align:middle line:90%
Gabby touched on TM.

00:46:21.005 --> 00:46:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But they just
quickly said, well,

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.150 align:middle line:90%
it's mantra-based meditation.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:27.360 align:middle line:84%
What is TM and how can
people relate to that?

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Or do you suggest that they
also look for other forms of it?

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I first learned about
meditation when I was 17 from

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.690 align:middle line:90%
my yoga teacher.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.648 align:middle line:84%
And it was really exciting,
because I had never

00:46:35.648 --> 00:46:37.270 align:middle line:84%
heard about anything
like that before.

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was actually teaching
the entire class based on

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Deepak Chopra's "Seven
Spiritual Laws of Success."

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
my gateway drugs

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.323 align:middle line:84%
into the world of
personal development

00:46:46.323 --> 00:46:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and into the world of
personal transformation.

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.900 align:middle line:90%
It was really exciting.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And I learned a very
simple technique.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was just about
sitting for 20 minutes.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And she shared a mantra with me.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.030 align:middle line:90%
And it was really effective.

00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And it has served me
for 20 years of my life.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And more recently, I went
through the TM meditation

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.800 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I loved about this
is, it felt like an evolution

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:08.490 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And I know so many people
that meditate, from sports

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.770 align:middle line:84%
stars to high performers
on every level.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has their own
flavor and their own style.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Some people, it's a
form of visualization.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And some people, it's just
a form of concentration.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And what I think is interesting
about TM, especially for me,

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.950 align:middle line:84%
is, there's a focus
on effortlessness.

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And as a human being
who is very driven,

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:35.040 align:middle line:84%
who is very type A, who
works and puts effort

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.340 align:middle line:84%
into everything, it's a really
wonderful counterbalance.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And I also loved that
it's not necessarily

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.280 align:middle line:84%
attached to any
particular religion

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and that it's really
open for all of us.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea that
there is a specific,

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.220 align:middle line:84%
very simple technique,
and, really,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:57.180 align:middle line:84%
from what I have learned, the
only way you can do it wrong is

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:02.190 align:middle line:84%
if you try and put in effort, I
found that this particular type

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:05.160 align:middle line:84%
of meditation really worked for
me as a great counterbalance,

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.990 align:middle line:84%
so that I can use all of my type
A, driven, "get-it-done-ness"

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:14.310 align:middle line:84%
in the rest of my life, and have
this really beautiful, simple,

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:19.680 align:middle line:84%
straightforward practice to help
me dip down into this infinite

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.770 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, this cosmic
consciousness that I think many

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:27.390 align:middle line:84%
of us have experienced or felt
at different times in our life,

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:30.780 align:middle line:84%
whether we're with a loved one,
or we're witnessing the beauty

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:31.860 align:middle line:90%
of a flower,

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.230 align:middle line:84%
or even in profound
sadness, when

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.540 align:middle line:84%
we feel this level
of connection,

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of oneness with
everyone and everything.

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
appreciate TM so much

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:45.690 align:middle line:84%
is, it gives me an
opportunity twice a day

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.780 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with that
space in a way that

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.490 align:middle line:90%
is simple and effortless.

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I come out
of my meditation,

00:48:53.850 --> 00:49:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I find myself feeling a
level of energy and charge

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.280 align:middle line:84%
that, frankly, I haven't
been able to access

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.520 align:middle line:90%
through any other method.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Magical.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask you a
very random question here.

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:10.655 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, do you
not fear death anymore?

00:49:10.655 --> 00:49:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And through not fearing
death, how does that change

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:13.770 align:middle line:90%
how you show up in the world?

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So death is something that I
actually contemplate a lot.

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I have always been fascinated
with end-of-life studies

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and with understanding
that so many people that

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:29.520 align:middle line:84%
have passed before us
have been generous enough

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.540 align:middle line:90%
to give us wisdom.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:34.230 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite books is by
Bronnie Ware, "The Five Regrets

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.400 align:middle line:90%
of the Dying."

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And the number one regret over
hundreds of beautiful souls

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that she's helped pass to
the other side, it was this.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had lived a life true
to myself and not the life

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:53.400 align:middle line:90%
that others had expected of me.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I feel, like when it
comes to understanding

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:59.460 align:middle line:84%
that each of us have a
gift, that we were put

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.800 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth for a
reason, that there never

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.310 align:middle line:84%
will be another one
of us, understanding

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.970 align:middle line:84%
that now is the time to
take whatever it is--

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:11.820 align:middle line:84%
our passions, our
quirks, and our visions--

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and bring them out
into the world,

00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:15.720 align:middle line:84%
because we will
never be here again.

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea
of understanding

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:21.510 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to die, I
think it's quite liberating.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we all know
we're on a train heading

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:90%
to the same destination.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no mystery about that.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at that
as something exciting,

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.850 align:middle line:84%
that we have this
limited amount of time,

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:36.120 align:middle line:84%
we're here to express our
joy, to express our love,

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.090 align:middle line:84%
to make a difference, to
contribute to others, all

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:43.620 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, it becomes less
something to fear and more

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:47.400 align:middle line:84%
of something that's this
motivating, inspiring truth.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing about
realizing that we are all

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.280 align:middle line:84%
going to die, what is
kind of cool about that

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.670 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing that
everything in life

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.740 align:middle line:90%
is about what we make of it.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And we're here to have joy.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.100 align:middle line:84%
In 100 years, who's
going to care?

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to spend five
years learning to dance

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and doing whatever the
heck we want to do,

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.420 align:middle line:84%
if that brings us joy and
it brings more good energy

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.920 align:middle line:90%
in the planet, so be it.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.610 align:middle line:84%
I think understanding
that death is coming,

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's coming for
all of us, it also

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.840 align:middle line:84%
allows us to be a little
more light-hearted, to not

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.610 align:middle line:90%
take things so damn seriously.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, in 100 years, we're
all going to be powder.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.283 align:middle line:90%
Does it really matter?

00:51:24.283 --> 00:51:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Does it really matter?

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Is anyone really
thinking about us?

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm just so not
good enough, or I don't

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:30.380 align:middle line:90%
know if I could do x, y, or z.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.290 align:middle line:90%
It's like, do it!

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Just do it!

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:84%
In 100 years, no one's
even going to know,

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.470 align:middle line:84%
so you might as well have
a party while you're here.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.160 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:38.520 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
a point in your life

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:41.995 align:middle line:90%
where you start to realize that.

00:51:41.995 --> 00:51:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you do realize it,
it's like everything changes.

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:46.180 align:middle line:84%
You're like, whoa,
I could be a weirdo?

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:46.980 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:47.810 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the ideas that
continues to drive me is

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:57.090 align:middle line:84%
something that I've believed
since I was little, which is,

00:51:57.090 --> 00:52:00.870 align:middle line:84%
every single person on the
planet comes here with a set

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:05.400 align:middle line:84%
of unique gifts and talents
that only they can express.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And part of the adventure
and the journey of life

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:11.910 align:middle line:84%
is discovering what those
are and then sharing them

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:13.020 align:middle line:90%
with others.

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And this idea that
there never has been

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and there never will
be another you, so you

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.390 align:middle line:84%
are a one-time mega-event
in the damn universe,

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't share
your gifts with people

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.050 align:middle line:84%
on this planet right now,
that you are stealing

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:30.120 align:middle line:90%
from those who need you most.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
big wake-up call.

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
recognize that you really

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:35.730 align:middle line:84%
are a one-time mega-event
in the universe,

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.340 align:middle line:84%
holding back isn't
doing anyone any good.

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It's keeping you in this space
that's small and limited.

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.770 align:middle line:84%
It's keeping other
people from experiencing

00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:45.690 align:middle line:84%
your joy, or your
talents, or what

00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:47.610 align:middle line:84%
you're able to
contribute to the world.

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Everything gets better when
you take on that perspective

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and you let that supercharge
your actions, your intentions,

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
you're here to give.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>> So cool.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:00.990 align:middle line:84%
What's the secret in finding
lasting fulfillment in life?

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the best
reference points for lasting

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:06.490 align:middle line:84%
fulfillment actually comes from
Victor Frankl and "Man's Search

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:07.290 align:middle line:90%
for Meaning."

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So the way that he describes
it is really beautiful,

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:13.800 align:middle line:84%
that there's three avenues to
finding lasting fulfillment.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And really, the trick here
is, it's not about finding it.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It's really about creating it.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So avenue number one is having
some type of work or deed.

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So he shares this really
incredible story in his book

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:29.670 align:middle line:84%
where, when he was
captured by the Nazis,

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:31.860 align:middle line:84%
he actually had a
manuscript for his next book

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.710 align:middle line:84%
in his coat pocket, and
they took that from him.

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And part of what
helped him survive

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:40.920 align:middle line:84%
that horrific experience
was finding scraps of paper

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.320 align:middle line:84%
so that he could
reconstruct his manuscript.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.950 align:middle line:84%
That helped him stay focused
on what he was here to give,

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.830 align:middle line:84%
which helped him
survive and then thrive.

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:53.430 align:middle line:84%
The second avenue was about
finding and experiencing

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:56.130 align:middle line:90%
beauty and joy and love.

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways that he did
that throughout that experience

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.820 align:middle line:84%
was imagining his wife and
feeling the love from her

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:07.110 align:middle line:84%
in his heart, even
through his imagination.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:10.440 align:middle line:84%
There was one story where he
was traveling on the train,

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and everyone was
huddled together,

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:13.800 align:middle line:84%
and they were behind
bars, but they

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:15.800 align:middle line:90%
caught a glimpse of a sunset.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, it
brought them this sense

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:22.320 align:middle line:84%
of joy and fulfillment,
despite the most devastating

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.850 align:middle line:90%
circumstances.

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the final
avenue, which I

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.107 align:middle line:84%
think is something
that is really

00:54:27.107 --> 00:54:29.190 align:middle line:84%
a cornerstone of his work,
and it's something that

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:32.430 align:middle line:84%
can help all of us, was
finding and creating

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:35.370 align:middle line:84%
a way to have
meaning when there is

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:37.890 align:middle line:90%
suffering that is inevitable.

00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think, for all of us,
there are points in our lives

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.460 align:middle line:84%
where we will bump up against
suffering that is inevitable.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to extract
and create and share

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:51.510 align:middle line:84%
meaning from that, that is a
beautiful framework for finding

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and creating
lasting fulfillment.

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.170 align:middle line:84%
With fulfillment and meaning,
it really is a choice.

00:54:56.170 --> 00:54:58.560 align:middle line:84%
It's a choice that we get
to make in each moment.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.760 align:middle line:84%
What are we going
to make this mean?

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.220 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to choose to have

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.693 align:middle line:84%
this event, this circumstance,
this moment be joyous?

00:55:05.693 --> 00:55:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to be sitting
back in our energy going,

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:09.150 align:middle line:90%
I wish this was different?

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:12.210 align:middle line:84%
There's no way it can be
different, so that's useless.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to engage
with our full enthusiasm

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:16.087 align:middle line:90%
and our joy?

00:55:16.087 --> 00:55:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to show
up in each moment

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:20.340 align:middle line:84%
like we're really
meant to be there?

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that and
train ourselves to do that

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:25.800 align:middle line:84%
consistently, all of a sudden,
joy and meaning and fulfillment

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.270 align:middle line:90%
becomes a habit.

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.590 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a way of living.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a way that we engage
with the world around us.

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:33.863 align:middle line:84%
So it's less of something
that we're looking for

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's more of
something that we

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.660 align:middle line:90%
bring to everywhere we show up.

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Then people want to
hang out with you, right?

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:40.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes!

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they're like,
this person is cool.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.662 align:middle line:90%
Why are they always cool?

00:55:43.662 --> 00:55:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Even when shit happens,
they find a way.

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:47.080 align:middle line:90%
They find a meaning in it.

00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.390 align:middle line:90%
So how can people--

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:51.060 align:middle line:90%
this is the last question here--

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.570 align:middle line:84%
if they currently feel
lost, uncover their purpose

00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and create the impact and legacy
that they're meant to leave?

00:55:57.670 --> 00:56:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think when any
of us are feeling lost,

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:03.660 align:middle line:84%
we're feeling stuck,
we're feeling like, gosh,

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.630 align:middle line:84%
nothing's working right now, I
think one of the best things we

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.760 align:middle line:84%
can do-- and it's so
counterintuitive-- is,

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:10.380 align:middle line:90%
we have to celebrate.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.420 align:middle line:84%
We have to celebrate the fact
that we're in a tough spot.

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we're about to have
some kind of breakthrough.

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Something in our
life is not working

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and we've gotten
ourselves to the point

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:21.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're willing
to take action

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.250 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So that means changes
on the horizon.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So again, I know it's a
little counterintuitive,

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.385 align:middle line:84%
but please, take a
minute to celebrate.

00:56:27.385 --> 00:56:29.343 align:middle line:84%
Because something's off
track, and you're going

00:56:29.343 --> 00:56:30.820 align:middle line:90%
to get it right back on track.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:33.480 align:middle line:84%
The next thing we've got to
do is start where we are.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.957 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, we think we
have to change everything.

00:56:35.957 --> 00:56:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But really, what we have
to change is our attitude

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and how we're showing up.

00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So can you start with
the little things?

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:43.680 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, can
you make your bed

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:45.090 align:middle line:90%
with enthusiasm and passion?

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Can you be the best
damn bed-maker ever?

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Can you brush your teeth
like you really mean it?

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Can you start talking
with your family

00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.490 align:middle line:84%
like they're the
best family ever?

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you show up at
work and actually

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.140 align:middle line:84%
give your excellence and your
best and your heart and soul?

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Can you go into
that grocery store?

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you put a smile
on somebody's face?

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I know these things may
sound trite or insignificant,

00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:07.240 align:middle line:90%
but they're not.

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't be miserable
throughout your whole day,

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:12.850 align:middle line:84%
80%, 90% of your day,
complaining, stuck,

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:13.810 align:middle line:90%
nothing's working--

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:17.560 align:middle line:84%
[GRUNTING] --and then expect
to have some big breakthrough.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you practice
in the small moments,

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show up and I'm
going to look for some answers,

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
up and I am going

00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:27.370 align:middle line:84%
to be this person who is open to
new ideas, I'm going to show up

00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm actually going to put
a smile on someone else's face,

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take the
attention off myself

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:33.797 align:middle line:84%
and how I might
think that there's

00:57:33.797 --> 00:57:37.300 align:middle line:84%
something wrong with me, in that
putting my attention on someone

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:39.760 align:middle line:84%
else, I might actually
discover new answers

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.270 align:middle line:90%
or new possibilities.

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think when
we're stuck, I think

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.610 align:middle line:84%
when we're finding
ourselves in a bit of pain

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:49.270 align:middle line:84%
or we're feeling like nothing's
working, first, to celebrate,

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and then to start changing
how we're showing up

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:56.360 align:middle line:84%
in the micro-moments can create
a big trajectory of change.

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So awesome.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:59.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I do-- and
Matt will testify to this--

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:00.780 align:middle line:84%
is, I'll walk into the
office in the morning.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It's all glass, open,
this whole thing.

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I walk in and
everyone will see me.

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like--
[GASPS] --oh, my god,

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm so shocked, in
a really scary tone.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:08.040 align:middle line:90%
They're like, what do you mean?

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.030 align:middle line:90%
I'll be like, I'm alive!

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.905 align:middle line:90%
Can you believe this?

00:58:09.905 --> 00:58:10.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god!

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Then they start cracking up.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I go and kiss
and hug everybody

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.240 align:middle line:90%
in the office every morning.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I hug the guys, kiss
and hug the women.

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw a French train
conductor do this amidst chaos.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:21.570 align:middle line:84%
There was this
line up everywhere.

00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:22.420 align:middle line:90%
People were waiting.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:23.820 align:middle line:84%
They were going to miss
trains, everything.

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:24.695 align:middle line:90%
And this guy came in.

00:58:24.695 --> 00:58:27.270 align:middle line:84%
It was a station conductor, 36
years old, with the epaulets.

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.743 align:middle line:84%
And the people serving the
counters were in their 60's.

00:58:29.743 --> 00:58:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And he stopped and
he acknowledged them.

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:32.530 align:middle line:90%
He's like, bonjour.

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Ca va?

00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:34.470 align:middle line:90%
[KISSES] Tres bien.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:38.160 align:middle line:84%
He just took a moment to
connect amidst all this crap.

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's always so much
in life that's going on.

00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But just taking that moment
to connect or be grateful

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.910 align:middle line:84%
can transform your
experience of life.

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, then
everything else changes.

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to
gratitude for a minute?

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.085 align:middle line:84%
Because I know when I asked a
lot of people about happiness,

00:58:50.085 --> 00:58:51.630 align:middle line:84%
they're like, be grateful for
the fact that you've even got

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:52.560 align:middle line:90%
shoes.

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:54.060 align:middle line:84%
That changes your
whole perspective.

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.932 align:middle line:84%
How important is it to
cultivate a sense of gratitude

00:58:56.932 --> 00:58:58.140 align:middle line:90%
when you're a businessperson.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Because shit's going to
go wrong all the time.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.950 align:middle line:84%
It goes wrong as much
as it goes right.

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But how do you show
up with gratitude?

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Or even in your day to
day life, how important

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:09.930 align:middle line:90%
is cultivating gratitude?

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I think gratitude
is everything,

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:13.530 align:middle line:84%
because it speaks
to perspective.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Gratitude allows us to really
take stock of everything that's

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:18.660 align:middle line:90%
going right.

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.310 align:middle line:84%
At any given moment, you
can focus on what's working

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:22.110 align:middle line:90%
or what's not.

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And gratitude starts
to create this habit

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:27.868 align:middle line:84%
of looking for what's
going right right now.

00:59:27.868 --> 00:59:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, when we're
in the toughest spots,

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that's when we need
to get down to basics.

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Am I breathing?

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Do I have a roof over my head?

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Is there some semblance of
food in my refrigerator?

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there anyone that
I could potentially

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.220 align:middle line:90%
call to connect with?

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Is there water coming
out of my faucet?

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Realizing that for billions
of our other humans,

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:52.050 align:middle line:90%
the answer is likely no.

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can say yes
to any of those things,

00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:57.600 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
a reality check.

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.910 align:middle line:90%
You have to be humble.

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:02.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to recognize that
you are so much better off

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.130 align:middle line:84%
than literally billions of
our brothers and sisters

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.530 align:middle line:84%
around the world who
deserve that dignity.

01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:10.920 align:middle line:84%
So having a sense of gratitude
for the basic stuff right now

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.410 align:middle line:84%
can instantly shift
your perspective.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:14.640 align:middle line:90%
It can shift your energy.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And it can get you
in a space where

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.720 align:middle line:90%
you can turn things around.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

01:00:21.082 --> 01:00:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to finish on one more
question, unless there's

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.633 align:middle line:84%
anything specific
you want to cover.

01:00:25.633 --> 01:00:26.800 align:middle line:90%
I think you're pretty happy.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty happy.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy.

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:31.183 align:middle line:84%
So let's finish with
this last question.

01:00:31.183 --> 01:00:32.100 align:middle line:90%
We're out in the back.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.190 align:middle line:90%
We're backstage.

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:34.510 align:middle line:90%
You're doing your power move.

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you little
karate chops in your back.

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And you're
about to step out.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And out there is
the world's media.

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's listening.

01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:42.675 align:middle line:84%
It's being broadcast
in every language.

01:00:42.675 --> 01:00:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's Marie's opportunity to
leave her two to three minutes

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:48.550 align:middle line:84%
of wisdom with the world and
leave a message for people that

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
is really, up to where you are
right now, the sum of the work

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that you've done in order to
be able to help activate people

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:57.010 align:middle line:90%
and activate their genius.

01:00:57.010 --> 01:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
What message would
you give to them?

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It's remembering, really,
that there never has been

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and there never
will be another you.

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
God doesn't make any extra
people just for the heck of it.

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So to understand what
a miracle you are

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:23.260 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth in this
moment right now,

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to use your
heart, and your skills,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and your perspective,
and your unique story

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to connect with other
humans and to make

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.600 align:middle line:84%
a difference in their life,
that's all you're here to do.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to
be a grand expression.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be a billionaire.

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
change anything.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
You just have to show up
and be willing to show up

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:52.183 align:middle line:84%
every single day and realize
that you do make a difference.

01:01:52.183 --> 01:01:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And the difference that
you make is up to you.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:01.792 align:middle line:90%
