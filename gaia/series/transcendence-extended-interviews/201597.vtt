00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:07.568 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:09.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James
here for Food Matters.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.980 align:middle line:10%
And I'm excited to be chatting
with a close friend of mine

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.000 align:middle line:10%
today.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.280 align:middle line:10%
I feel like, in
many ways, our paths

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.660 align:middle line:10%
have dovetailed over the years.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.140 align:middle line:84%
He had an early involvement
in a documentary

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:84%
called Simply Raw, which
was raw for 30 days.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They took diabetic patients
and put them on raw food.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Later on, he's been
involved in more films

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:84%
as his personal journey has
expanded into plant medicine,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.180 align:middle line:90%
plant consciousness, shamanism.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And he made an awesome film
called "Sacred Science."

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and also executive producer
of the documentary series

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:90%
"Remedy."

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:90%
His name is Nick Polizzi.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.890 align:middle line:84%
He's also a Hay House author
of the same title, "Sacred

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:90%
Science."

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.558 align:middle line:84%
And today we're
going to be talking

00:00:50.558 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot about plant medicine
and the renaissance of plants

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:84%
coming back into the human
populace and helping us heal.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Nick, how are you doing?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing great.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Honor to be here.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.010 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be fun.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I like to start most interviews
with a little personal story,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
like understanding more
about your catalyst.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
How you got into understanding
that plant medicine

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.353 align:middle line:84%
could heal, and sort
of kick starting

00:01:14.353 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:90%
that whole journey of yours.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.215 align:middle line:90%
Where did it start for you?

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I definitely did not start
out as a natural-type person.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I was just your typical
Northeast United States kid,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:90%
raised to be good at business.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I got to college and
got right into business stuff.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I was living a
pretty normal life,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
eating the sad American
diet, drinking every night,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
smoking cigarettes, having
fun in my early 20's when

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.892 align:middle line:84%
out of nowhere I started getting
chronic migraine headaches.

00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
They're called ocular
migraines, the type that I get.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when
people hear about headaches,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.820 align:middle line:84%
especially migraines
headaches, they

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:84%
don't realize how painful they
are unless they've had them.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a normal headache.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like you had
too much to drink,

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.327 align:middle line:84%
then you have a little bit of
a headache the next morning.

00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:05.287 align:middle line:84%
An ocular migraine
headache will end your day.

00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It'll take you out of
whatever you're doing.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
You are now laying in bed
in the dark in a cool place

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
without any sounds
because everything,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.430 align:middle line:84%
every bit of stimuli
will hurt your brain.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just
excruciatingly painful.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
I can liken it to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:84%
is if you've ever broken a bone
and pushed on that bone when

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
it's broken, that
type of shooting pain

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.530 align:middle line:84%
is what a severe ocular
migraine headache is.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So I went from being
normal, having a great life,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.720 align:middle line:84%
chasing girls around, being
that young New Yorker business

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.000 align:middle line:84%
guy to all of sudden I had this
really severe health condition.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And I come from a
family of nurses.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I did
was I went to my aunt's.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, this is
happening, what do I do.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.008 align:middle line:84%
And they got me to one
of the best neurologists

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:90%
in Connecticut.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And so after that I started
to go see this neurologist.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And they did MRIs, they
put me on all kinds

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:90%
of prescription drugs.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were going at it the
contemporary medicine way.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's all I knew.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:90%
So I did it.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't work.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So every time I
had a migraine, I

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
would try one of
the new medications.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:90%
It might work once partially.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.760 align:middle line:84%
But then after that,
the next event,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:90%
I would get two each week.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So the second one
would completely

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.330 align:middle line:84%
wipe out any medication
that I tried to put on it.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:90%
So it wasn't working.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the
neurologist a bunch of times.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
He kept putting me on
different medications.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.438 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately I
went back one time

00:03:31.438 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, hey,
what else you got.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.722 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I'm out of
pharmaceuticals to handle this.

00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I can
give you is something

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:90%
that is preventative in nature.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It is maybe going to
help you 30% chance.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But it will definitely change
your mood and your perception

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:90%
of your reality a little bit.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And so even though
I in my early 20's

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know anything
about alternative medicine,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that somehow was
where I drew the line.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no,
I don't want it.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I walked away and
realized that modern medicine

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:90%
had nothing for me.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
I was getting these
excruciatingly painful

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.660 align:middle line:84%
life-altering
headaches twice a week.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:90%
And I had no answers.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So out of desperation,
I started looking

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:90%
into any alternative there was.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, when you
ask an herbalist, when

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:84%
you ask a functional medicine
doctor a lot of times, when you

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
ask anyone who is on the
alternative medicine path how

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.735 align:middle line:84%
they get on it, a lot of times
they'll tell you, well, it

00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.050 align:middle line:90%
actually start with me.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Modern medicine failed me, and I
had no options left, and then I

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
realized, oh wait, there's
all these other traditions

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that I've been used
for thousands of years

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:90%
that I have never looked into.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.455 align:middle line:84%
And I started going
down that road.

00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I did.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:90%
I started going down that road.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And it turned me on to
looking into nutrition,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:84%
looking into energy
healing techniques,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and also looking into herbs.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was it that
worked for you in this?

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Was it like a herbal thing?

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Was it a complete diet change?

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.785 align:middle line:84%
Was it a combination
of anything?

00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it was one
particular idea that

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
really turned the
tide for you on this?

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.780 align:middle line:10%
>> What it came down to
was two things for me.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.340 align:middle line:90%
One was working through trauma.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of one of my
chronic migraine headaches,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.525 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine who specializes
in a trauma healing technique,

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
it's an energy
healing technique.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
He called me and he said,
hey, I want to try something.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.898 align:middle line:84%
I know you're
going through this.

00:05:21.898 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I know it's excruciating.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Just stay on the phone with me.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And let's go through
this protocol

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and see if we can
get underneath this

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's anything else
going on in your psyche that

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:90%
might be contributing to these.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.910 align:middle line:90%
We went through it.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was definitely,
definitely trying

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
to squash some severe
childhood trauma.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.990 align:middle line:10%
So in that moment, went from
having a really severe ocular

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:10%
migraine headache to
having a normal headache.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.465 align:middle line:10%
So it took it down by
80%, which was great.

00:05:51.465 --> 00:05:53.090 align:middle line:10%
That was a step in
the right direction.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:10%
It made me realize that
there's a lot more out there.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.365 align:middle line:84%
That was better than
modern medicine had ever

00:05:56.365 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:90%
done for me by far.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So I started realizing--
and this is also something

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that I think a lot of
people on this path

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.878 align:middle line:84%
realize once they start stepping
toward alternative medicine--

00:06:03.878 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:90%
it's one distinction at a time.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:90%
You make one distinction.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:84%
You realize that there's
an improvement here,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:90%
an improvement here.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:10%
And you start getting
encouraged and digging deeper.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So digging deeper, I
started looking into my diet

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and trying to figure out what
I might be eating that could

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:90%
be contributing to these.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
taking out cheese

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and taking out meat and taking
out gluten and all that stuff.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Nothing really
seemed to budge it

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
until I took out an herb that
I had been intaking probably

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.865 align:middle line:84%
since I was like 16 without
realizing it was an herb

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and that it was a medicine,
and that I had been taking it

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:84%
every single morning
without realizing it.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's coffee.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:90%
So it was crazy.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't an herb
that healed me.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
understanding of herbalism

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding
that we Americans for sure

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:84%
are on a serious herbal medicine
that we don't even realize

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:90%
has that potency.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I got off coffee,
migraines went away like that.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Never came back.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.460 align:middle line:84%
The only time I ever have
a problem with migraines

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
is if I get into that busy
realm of life where I'm like,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I could use a little
bit of coffee.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:10%
It's only when I drink coffee
that I'll ever get a migraine.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
the last 10 years

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:90%
of my life-- migraine-free.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:84%
It came down to
working through trauma

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and understanding a
highly medicinal herb,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:84%
very alkaline
herb, that I'd been

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.635 align:middle line:90%
ingesting without realizing it.

00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, I mean, you can have DNA
tests done to see the half life

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:90%
of caffeine in your body.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And people react
differently to that.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Laurentine cannot deal with
any stimulants whatsoever.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.232 align:middle line:90%
I joke, do you want a coffee.

00:07:35.232 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:90%
She's never had coffee.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:90%
Can't have it.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:39.527 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was it
was that for you.

00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So some sort of biochemical
individuality that you

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.600 align:middle line:90%
were reacting to that coffee.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk more about
this emotional technique.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
What was the technique that
you were guided through?

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So that the energy healing
technique that helped me

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
through the trauma
portion was EFT,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:90%
or Emotional Freedom Technique.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And my friend Nick Ortner was
the one who taught me that.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a technique whereby you
go through a tapping process

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
on different ancient Chinese
meridian points in your face

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and upper torso while repeating
different affirmations that

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
take you into the
root of trauma.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the type of trauma
that you uncovered in this

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Was it something specific?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Or was it a general thing
you're working through?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It was crazy.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think he'd
mind me bringing it up.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:90%
But it got very specific.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So what happened with that EFT
session was I got into the pain

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and started making distinctions
on what the pain actually was.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And it turned into a bunch
of different energies

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
that weren't really
painful inherently.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:90%
But together, there was this--

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:90%
what do you even call it--

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
cacophony of energies that then
produced this pain feeling.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I started teasing
out those energies,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden I
started getting images.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.112 align:middle line:84%
I don't if you ever
had this, but all

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden like a
flash of an image

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.490 align:middle line:90%
might come into your mind.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.073 align:middle line:84%
Almost like a dream
in a way, but like

00:08:55.073 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
some kind of an image or a
word or a sound or something

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.508 align:middle line:90%
like that from your past.

00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened to me.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So while I was teasing these
different threads of energy

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:84%
out on top of that, I started
having these really interesting

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:90%
images from my childhood.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And so all of sudden I was
taken into this one moment

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
with my father where something
happened that I didn't even

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
realize was that
traumatic, but it was.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting when
you get into trauma.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times with
trauma you think

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:10%
that trauma must mean
abuse or something really,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.790 align:middle line:10%
really obvious,
like being touched

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:10%
in an inappropriate way.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times
trauma can happen

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:90%
in the most subtle, subtle way.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:84%
In this situation,
I just wasn't given

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of acknowledgment
or a little bit of love

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:90%
that I needed.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get hit, I
didn't get yelled at.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a point in time
where I really needed something

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't get that energy
or that acknowledgment

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:90%
that I needed.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And it got me really bad.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's formed a scar
tissue apparently.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Not real scar tissue, but
emotional scar tissue.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.377 align:middle line:84%
And so this technique
took me right there.

00:10:03.377 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't get away from it.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:90%
It was so painful.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And I had to deal with it.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So then we tapped
on that for a while.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And as I got more
comfortable with this

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.935 align:middle line:84%
and understood this
memory, the pain went away.

00:10:16.935 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, I mean, in an era where
we're becoming more au fait

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.530 align:middle line:84%
with this idea that energies
can create emotional scars

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:90%
in the body, you identified one.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a profound realization.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to use EFT
and the elimination of coffee

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to work through that I
think is uniquely profound.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.790 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking
before about this,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:84%
before we started the
interview, about how

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:84%
in our upbringing in a
Western developed culture

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I've been referred to it in a
previous interview as a WEIRD

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:52.530 align:middle line:90%
culture--

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Western Educated
Industrialized Rich Democratic.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
We live in this
developed world where

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:06.798 align:middle line:84%
we have this association with
success and money and power.

00:11:06.798 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And that it's
important to have that.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And most of our
parents have groomed

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
us to be little young
factories and results

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:90%
of that type of upbringing.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Were you conditioned in
that way by your parents.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:84%
What was it like emotionally
growing up for you?

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:10%
>> I definitely grew up in that
same WEIRD-type environment

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:10%
where the ability to make
money and be self-sufficient is

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:10%
the ultimate metric by which
we measure ourselves here

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:10%
in the United States.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:10%
It just is.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, it's undebatable.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Look at how we live our lives.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:10%
My parents were both
small business owners.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:48.350 align:middle line:10%
And they worked their butts off
to make their businesses work.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:10%
And in the meantime,
my sister and I

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:10%
were left pretty
much on our own.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:10%
So after school, we came
home and we wouldn't see them

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:10%
until 6:00, 6:30.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:10%
And then we go to
bed at 7:30 or 8:00.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:10%
So there's about an
hour and a half of time

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:10%
hanging out with your parents.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:10%
But our parents were so wound
up from having to work so hard.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.020 align:middle line:10%
And they come home and
parent their children

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:10%
that there would be
some kind of release,

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:19.060 align:middle line:10%
whether it was using well,
using cannabis or using alcohol.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.502 align:middle line:84%
And my sister and I
sort of were on our own.

00:12:23.502 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we always say,
my sister and I. We're like,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:84%
we had parents, but
they're more like siblings.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:90%
They were doing their thing.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:90%
And we had to make our own way.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were there if
it was an emergency.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, they're trying

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
to keep up in this WEIRD
society that we live in.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And that meant working
their butts off,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
getting up really early,
going to work, coming home,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:84%
medicating in some way to
wind down and be able to go

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:84%
to sleep, then waking up in the
morning and then chugging three

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.810 align:middle line:84%
cups of that same herb that I
talked about before-- coffee--

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to get their brain and their
heart rate going again.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:90%
And do it over again.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
The quality of
life wasn't there.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
conspicuous to me.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
But I was probably too young
to understand what was actually

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.620 align:middle line:90%
wrong with that picture.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.210 align:middle line:10%
Something that we notice a lot
in Central and South America--

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.252 align:middle line:10%
I do a lot of work in
Central and South America--

00:13:13.252 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:10%
is that by our standards
these people are poor.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:10%
These people don't have
health care like we do.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.600 align:middle line:10%
They don't have
predictability in terms

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:10%
of where the next meal is going
to come from a lot of the time.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:10%
They live on top of each other.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:10%
You get three or four
generations of family members

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:10%
that live in the same house.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:10%
And by our WEIRD
American standards,

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.540 align:middle line:10%
that sounds like a nightmare.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But when you look into
their level of happiness,

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%
it's through the roof.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:90%
These people are so connected.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.480 align:middle line:90%
They're so happy to be.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're really well-adjusted
as adults and also as children.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:84%
It's really wild to me to
see that juxtaposition.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.930 align:middle line:84%
When I look at my life,
I was a latchkey kid.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:84%
We shipped our grandparents
down to Florida.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.135 align:middle line:84%
And that's a sign
of yeah, good, yeah

00:14:10.135 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
you're actually keeping up.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
You're doing what
you should be doing.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:90%
You're successful.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:84%
That separation
of family you know

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:90%
is actually a sign of wellness.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a sign of wealth.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a sign of accomplishment
in our culture.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
We look at cultures that have
these generations of families

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
stacked on top of each
other as unfortunate.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.995 align:middle line:90%
We've been duped.

00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Multi-generational homes are
a big thing in the developing

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And we try to
segregate ourselves

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:90%
from them, our wealth.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
We've got multiple
homes, multiple condos.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.980 align:middle line:84%
We ship our old people
off into old folks homes.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
So true, it's definitely
something to think about.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Can I pull back
a little bit more

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:90%
just before we progress further.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
When there was this
moment, tell me

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.030 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more
before we get deeper

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.105 align:middle line:84%
into the shamanic
Amazon journeys, which

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm keen to go there.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.865 align:middle line:90%
We'll get there.

00:15:08.865 --> 00:15:13.090 align:middle line:84%
How when you were growing up,
you had to get good grades

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:13.890 align:middle line:90%
to get the love.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.307 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
conditional love,

00:15:15.307 --> 00:15:17.925 align:middle line:84%
and that potentially created
some trauma in your life.

00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we can sort of speak to
a few other things after that.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
But what was that
experience like?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.168 align:middle line:84%
You spoke about how
you would come home

00:15:26.168 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
and that you were validated for
getting good grades at school

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:90%
That was the chief metric.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.930 align:middle line:10%
>> So when I was growing up,
there was a really interesting

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:10%
period of time when it went
from feeling safe and beautiful

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:46.640 align:middle line:10%
and warm, probably between
the ages of 0 to 5--

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:10%
everything felt easy and great.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:10%
And I just felt this warmth.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I can distinctly
remember that feeling of life

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.550 align:middle line:10%
is really good.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:10%
This is a great place
I was born into.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:10%
This is a great world.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:10%
When it came time to go to
kindergarten, first grade,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:10%
second grade-- very
clear, everything

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:10%
got scary unpacking that through
a lot of different modalities

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:10%
and types of work,
whether it's shamanism

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:10%
or just straight
up talk therapy.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:10%
The culprit behind
that fear turned out

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:10%
to be the expectation
of getting good grades.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:26.060 align:middle line:10%
So I went from being someone
who was loved and treated

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:10%
well, no matter what, to
being loved and treated well

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:10%
only if you get a good grade,
only if your teacher tells us

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.623 align:middle line:10%
that you're behaving yourself,
only if you get on the school

00:16:41.623 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:10%
bus and you don't cry.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:10%
And that had a tremendous
impact on my life.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.080 align:middle line:10%
Things went downhill
from there for a while.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:10%
And it's really interesting
the way this weird society

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:10%
that we live in works,
because the only reason why

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm a Hay House author or
making films and doing what I do

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.348 align:middle line:10%
is I managed to ace a test
at the end of high school.

00:17:06.348 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's no reason I
should be going to college.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:10%
There's no reason.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:10%
If they saw my grades,
they'd be like, nope, sorry.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:10%
Not going to happen.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:10%
You'll be more of like a
gas station kind of guy.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle line:10%
But I aced the SAT.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.920 align:middle line:10%
And somehow, there's a
loophole in our WEIRD culture

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:10%
where the 12 years of grades
is almost equal to how

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:10%
you do on this one test.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:10%
It's one standardized
test, and I just

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.123 align:middle line:10%
happened to do well on it.

00:17:30.123 --> 00:17:33.118 align:middle line:10%
And that's how I got
to where I am now.

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:34.660 align:middle line:10%
It's not how I got
to where I am now,

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.243 align:middle line:10%
but it's how I got
my foot in the door

00:17:36.243 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:10%
and was able to then
prove myself in college.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:10%
It's so crazy.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.210 align:middle line:10%
We do the strangest things here.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, my life
changed for the worst

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.400 align:middle line:10%
once I started going to school,
because the expectation that

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.170 align:middle line:10%
was attached to it was immense.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:10%
And the only way
my parents really

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.323 align:middle line:10%
knew how to get me to do better
in school was to withhold love.

00:17:57.323 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:10%
It's something
that you and I have

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.620 align:middle line:10%
been talking about
a lot, which is

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:10%
this conditional love
that we've been trained

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.410 align:middle line:10%
to use with our own kids.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.500 align:middle line:10%
And now that I have my own
two children, I see that.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It's very conspicuous when I say
that to my son River or my son

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Rowan.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:10%
It's like, hey, do you want
to have a sleepover tonight?

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:10%
That's fine, but you
better whatever it is.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.100 align:middle line:10%
Do you want to get that
shiny new skateboard?

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.120 align:middle line:10%
Fine, you can have that.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:10%
Totally love to give it
to you, but only if you.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.992 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.992 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
There's something
really wrong with that.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't see it that
much in other cultures.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't see it in
the other cultures

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
that we visit to make our
films very much at all.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.321 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be
uniquely American.

00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Made in America, right?

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:51.623 align:middle line:84%
You're filming for an emotional
healing sort of docuseries.

00:18:51.623 --> 00:18:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I know you do a lot
of filming and work,

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.165 align:middle line:84%
but we were talking
about an interesting chap

00:18:55.165 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
you met who works with
heroin addicts in Vancouver.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that experience.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.123 align:middle line:84%
I found that really
fascinating in how

00:19:03.123 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:90%
it relates to this discussion.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the coolest interviews
I ever did was with a gentleman

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:90%
named Gabor Maté.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
He works in Vancouver
with heroin addicts.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Vancouver has one
of the biggest,

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:84%
if not the biggest, heroin
epidemic in North America.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And he is not only
helping them heal,

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:84%
but he's trying to understand
what is causing the addiction

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It's something in herbalism and
in traditional medicines that

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:84%
fascinates me, getting
to the root cause

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.480 align:middle line:84%
not just covering it
up like a Band-Aid.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So he's trying to figure out,
why are these users using?

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
What got them there?

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And not every time, but
the large majority of times

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
when he asks people
about their lives,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.450 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that they have
severe abandonment issues.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And so he has a great book out
called "When the Body Says No."

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
many facets of it,

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the many
underpinnings of his work,

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.070 align:middle line:84%
is this notion
that people who use

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
heroin are trying to get the
equivalent of their mother's

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:84%
love, love that they
never got from their mom.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And people say, who use heroin,
that the feeling that you get,

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
that warmth that
you get when you

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:84%
inject that syringe
into your arm

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:90%
is something like pure love.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:90%
So it makes you wonder.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
This epidemic that is happening
here in North America--

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is it tied to this
conditionality of love

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.771 align:middle line:84%
giving, for lack
of a better word?

00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome story.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Can probably explain
a lot of the addiction

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.980 align:middle line:90%
to many different substances.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:84%
People suffer from abandonment
or conditional love issues

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:55.313 align:middle line:84%
because of this society we've
been sort of driven to create.

00:20:55.313 --> 00:20:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And now we have to
solve those problems.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really
talked about,

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.553 align:middle line:84%
and I think it'll become a
bigger part of the discussion

00:21:00.553 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
landscape as we start
to heal from that.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's transition now
talking a little bit more

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:11.770 align:middle line:84%
about your experience
traveling down into the Amazon,

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:90%
meeting with shamans.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:84%
What were some of the
first trips you did like?

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:84%
What have been some of your
coolest experiences down there?

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
What are the biggest
things you've

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.407 align:middle line:90%
learned from these cultures?

00:21:20.407 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We made a film called
"The Sacred Science,"

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's all about
Amazonian shamanism.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:84%
We took eight patients
from around the world

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.930 align:middle line:84%
who were really ill with a wide
array of diseases, from cancer

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.110 align:middle line:84%
to Parkinson's to
drug addiction,

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.280 align:middle line:84%
down to the middle of nowhere
on the border of Peru and Brazil

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:84%
to work with shamans and
their medicines for 30 days.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And right now, there's
definitely a meme

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.730 align:middle line:90%
about ayahuasca going around.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.120 align:middle line:90%
People have heard of this.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have heard about
this Amazonian visionary plant.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.827 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
are talking to me

00:22:00.827 --> 00:22:02.910 align:middle line:84%
or asking me questions
about "The Sacred Science,"

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.442 align:middle line:84%
they always assume that the
crazy healing breakthroughs

00:22:05.442 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:84%
that happen in "The
Sacred Science"

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:84%
happen because of
ayahuasca or that ayahuasca

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:90%
was a big, big component.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely played
a role down there.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
coolest things that I

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
think we saw as filmmakers
down in the Amazon

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:84%
was that beyond the crazy
number of medicinal plants

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that they use and beyond
these amazing and mysterious

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
visionary potions that they use
like ayahuasca, the answer is

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
a lot more boring than what I
think people wanted to hear.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:84%
There is this really close
connection to nature.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Our patients that
we brought down

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
were all excited about all
these different rites of passage

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:90%
they were going to go through.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.595 align:middle line:84%
And we had all
different kinds of walks

00:22:46.595 --> 00:22:48.630 align:middle line:84%
of life-- people who
were afraid of nature,

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:90%
people who love nature.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:84%
But everybody came down
with all their devices,

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and they were not
expecting what we

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
were going to do when they
got there, which was take away

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.352 align:middle line:84%
every electronic device they
had, every book they brought,

00:23:01.352 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:84%
anything else
besides their clothes

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:04.727 align:middle line:84%
and their core needs was
taken away from them.

00:23:04.727 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were politely
walked a mile into the jungle

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and ushered into their personal
dieta hut, which is a one room

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.930 align:middle line:84%
hut in the middle of
nowhere where you're going

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:90%
to be by yourself for 30 days.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:21.715 align:middle line:84%
So people struggled
with the diet.

00:23:21.715 --> 00:23:23.590 align:middle line:84%
People struggled a little
with the ayahuasca.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
But no one struggled
with anything

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.690 align:middle line:84%
as much as the isolation
in a jungle hut

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
without your pacifiers or
your electronic devices

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to help you ignore what's
going on in your psyche, what's

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
going on in your reality,
what's going on in your body.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So one of the coolest
things I guess

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I learned down in the Amazon
was the simplicity of life.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
The removal of all of
the distraction that we

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
have here in the Western
world and the developed world

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.867 align:middle line:84%
is a huge part of
the healing process.

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't escape yourself when
you're in the middle of nowhere

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:00.290 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle with no one to
talk to and no news to read

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and no Facebook
feed to check out.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's about a seven
or eight day window there

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:90%
where it's agonizing for people.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's ugly.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.195 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to watch.

00:24:10.195 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:84%
You want to give
them their phone

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
back because taking that
phone away from somebody

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:90%
seems so innocent.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I just use this to kind of do
business and call my friends.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.360 align:middle line:90%
But it's not that anymore.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It's everything now, and it's
helping us avoid ourselves.

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.626 align:middle line:84%
Avoiding ourselves means
avoiding your own healing path.

00:24:29.626 --> 00:24:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You've spoken a little
bit in some of the interviews

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I've watched around how shamans
role is to remove blocks from

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:37.590 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about this philosophy.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
What is a shaman here to do
really, and what is a shaman?

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:43.392 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:90%
There's a shaman in the jungle.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.042 align:middle line:90%
His name is Habin.

00:24:49.042 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:84%
He's a tobacco shaman,
which to a lot of people

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.590 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely ludicrous.

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Wait, tobacco shaman?

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.118 align:middle line:84%
What, you smoke cigarettes
and you get better?

00:24:56.118 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Tobacco is a sacred
plant down there,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's used in a
bunch of different ways.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And used medicinally,
it's extremely powerful.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.420 align:middle line:84%
When I was leaving the jungle
last time I was down there,

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:84%
he and I were having
a coca ceremony.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.500 align:middle line:90%
We were chewing coca leaves.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
speaking in Spanish,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.277 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
these westerners.

00:25:18.277 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:90%
They come down here.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
They want us to heal them
like we're a surgeon,

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.070 align:middle line:84%
like we operate by
the same principles

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:84%
that their weird
medicine operates by.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.518 align:middle line:84%
He's like, that's
not what we do.

00:25:27.518 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:90%
They've got it all wrong.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
A shaman doesn't
heal his patient.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:84%
A shaman merely
clears the blocks

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that are preventing the patient
from healing themselves.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, just changed
the way I looked at everything.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.420 align:middle line:84%
We're responsible for our own
healing journey is essentially

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:90%
what that means.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And a byproduct of getting
into traditional medicine,

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
alternative
medicine, is that you

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:84%
start realizing how much
power has been taken away

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.450 align:middle line:84%
from you by the current
system of medicine

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:90%
that we all find ourselves in.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:90%
It's our job.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.900 align:middle line:90%
It's our job to know ourselves.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It's our job to be
able to feel ourselves.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's our job to be on a constant
journey of experimentation,

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
learning what we need
and what we don't need.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
at the core of what

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.340 align:middle line:84%
we're suffering from in
our society right now,

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:90%
this disempowerment.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:23.251 align:middle line:84%
We've given our power away to
people who don't even know us.

00:26:23.251 --> 00:26:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and people who don't
even know how to look after

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
their health themselves
sometimes, you know?

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember in the
movie, one of the more

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:84%
profound transformations I
think was a guy called Gary.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I forget, the Australian
guy-- was that his name,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.290 align:middle line:90%
or am I wrong?

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.350 align:middle line:90%
What's the Australian guy's--

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:90%
John!

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.637 align:middle line:84%
So he was like an executive
at some big bank or something

00:26:44.637 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:90%
in Australia, right?

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.660 align:middle line:84%
He fought tooth and
nail at the start.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.170 align:middle line:84%
He's like, don't take my food
away from me or don't do this.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:90%
He had cancer, right?

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember at the end,
he was like, I've seen god.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.580 align:middle line:84%
To me, he was the
transformation that

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:90%
embodied the film the most.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.980 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about this guy, his
story from your perspective.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.855 align:middle line:84%
I'm just recalling the
bits that came up for me.

00:27:11.855 --> 00:27:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So John-- we had to select
eight patients out of 400

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:90%
people who had applied.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Once he knew he was selected,
before I could even tell him

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.283 align:middle line:84%
about the program,
tell him that we

00:27:28.283 --> 00:27:30.950 align:middle line:84%
were going to cover his flights,
he'd already booked everything.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
He'd already figured out where
the center was going to be,

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.080 align:middle line:84%
or at least semi
close to where it

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
was going to be so that he
knew the airports to fly into.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:90%
He was a complete outdoorsman.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.092 align:middle line:90%
He was just all over this.

00:27:42.092 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:84%
He was like, I'm
going to be there.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing!

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be the best thing.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:90%
This is exactly what I need.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:49.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm totally cut out for this!

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And he gets down there-- and
this is honestly indicative

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of what we saw--

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
he was what somebody who on
paper looked like a perfect fit

00:27:58.670 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Totally an outdoorsman.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:90%
He's already interested in diet.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:90%
He was a raw foodist.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.412 align:middle line:84%
He was a vegan that ate
mostly raw, so we were like,

00:28:07.412 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, well he's not going to
have a problem necessarily

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.140 align:middle line:90%
with the nutrition.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.440 align:middle line:84%
But when he got down
there and he realized

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
that there was not going
to be anyone coming

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.330 align:middle line:84%
to his hut besides a
shaman twice a day who

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.290 align:middle line:90%
didn't speak his language--

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and when he realized that there
was no social hierarchy for him

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.550 align:middle line:84%
to be able to demonstrate his
understanding of the world

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and his understanding
of the healing process--

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and for him to
actually be mentoring

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:41.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe somebody else who might be
struggling, complete breakdown.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:90%
It's just a construct.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.480 align:middle line:84%
It was another ego
construct, and that was his.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.578 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
something we saw

00:28:47.578 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:90%
in almost every single patient.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
little pattern.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And for him, it was he
wanted to have the ability

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:03.120 align:middle line:84%
to teach and to mentor and
be the guy who was noticed

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.818 align:middle line:90%
for doing really well at this.

00:29:04.818 --> 00:29:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But when there was
no ability for him

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:84%
to be seen by
anybody because he's

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:90%
in his hut the entire time--

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and there's shamans
who don't really

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.613 align:middle line:90%
care about where he comes from.

00:29:13.613 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:84%
They just care about what
they see in front of them.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're giving
him the medicine

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.625 align:middle line:84%
to help him get
better, but there

00:29:18.625 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
is no him being able
to posture, I guess,

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.370 align:middle line:90%
and showcase his knowledge.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
He went through two weeks
of just absolute hell

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
having to be there
all by himself.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.120 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's
the lack of a device.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:84%
For other people, it's
just the isolation itself.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Not having the ability
to peacock at all

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.830 align:middle line:84%
when that's part of
your reality, for him,

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:90%
was devastating.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:49.220 align:middle line:84%
The ayahuasca ceremonies
for him were also

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.600 align:middle line:90%
really, really intense.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.848 align:middle line:90%


00:29:53.848 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Some of the patients
had a really easy time

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:90%
with the ayahuasca ceremonies.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:90%
It was exactly what they needed.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.057 align:middle line:90%
It was very gentle for them.

00:29:59.057 --> 00:30:03.680 align:middle line:84%
But for him-- and you can
only really postulate.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why it
was so hard for him,

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.970 align:middle line:90%
but his ego was so strong.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And from my own
experiences with ayahuasca,

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.270 align:middle line:84%
when I go in to a ceremony
and I've convinced myself

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that I'm somebody or that
these constructs around me

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.772 align:middle line:90%
are actually real--

00:30:19.772 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:84%
when my ego's gotten
out of control

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.272 align:middle line:90%
is when it's the hardest.

00:30:22.272 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And so if I was to guess
why it was so hard for him,

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd think it's because
he had such a strong ego.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.390 align:middle line:84%
He was the head of a
major company for a while.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.530 align:middle line:90%
He had all that, you know?

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.392 align:middle line:84%
And he was coming to us
in his mid to late 60s,

00:30:36.392 --> 00:30:38.600 align:middle line:84%
trying to heal his body but
with all that patterning.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So those ayahuasca ceremonies--
watching him go through it

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.357 align:middle line:90%
was painful.

00:30:43.357 --> 00:30:44.690 align:middle line:90%
It was painful to see him do it.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But he kept on going back, kept
on going back into the maloca

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and doing it whenever
it was offered.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.985 align:middle line:84%
And three weeks in, I think
that when you watch the movie

00:30:52.985 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:90%
you see the transformation.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.360 align:middle line:84%
He goes from being
someone who's just angry--

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
who's yelling at
shamans, yelling

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.190 align:middle line:84%
at the aides who are coming
in to bring him his food--

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.260 align:middle line:84%
yelling at them and just
being really difficult,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.260 align:middle line:84%
to all of a sudden he's
absolutely changed.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:84%
He's gone through some
kind of metamorphosis.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.618 align:middle line:84%
And then at the same time, his
PSA levels and other indicators

00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:15.410 align:middle line:84%
of prostate cancer
which he came to us with

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:90%
go down back to normal levels.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.376 align:middle line:84%
So it was really, really
fascinating to watch.

00:31:21.376 --> 00:31:23.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember that turnaround.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:90%
I remember seeing him.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the interviews
where he was just so excited.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:84%
There was that really difficult
personality in the film, right?

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:90%
And then here's I've seen God.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:90%
I know God.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I am God.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:40.750 align:middle line:90%
It all makes sense to me now.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It was a spiritual
transformation for him,

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:45.190 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And then for his physical
and biological markers

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:84%
to improve as well along with
that spiritual transformation,

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I think, is probably the
power of this type of medicine

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.940 align:middle line:84%
or that whole experience
of working with shamans

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and going through sort of
a plant medicine journey.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Would you say so?

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It feels like in these
older traditions,

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:84%
there's much more emphasis
placed on spiritual wellness,

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:14.242 align:middle line:90%
whatever spirit means to you.

00:32:14.242 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:90%
It's different for everybody.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But just that internal world
of yours that isn't really

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.870 align:middle line:84%
taken into consideration
by modern medicine

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
is at the heart of
all these traditions.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why when you
go into a lot of these cultures,

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a baseline thing
you should be doing

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.520 align:middle line:84%
or that you're told to do to
clean the slate, so to speak,

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.695 align:middle line:84%
spiritually-- to
get the garbage out

00:32:34.695 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:84%
of there, the gobbledygook
out of your brain,

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.403 align:middle line:84%
out of your heart, out
of your energy fields

00:32:38.403 --> 00:32:40.830 align:middle line:84%
before you start
working with herbs

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.880 align:middle line:90%
and other different techniques.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
In the Amazon, it's
ayahuasca because it

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.410 align:middle line:84%
helps to dissolve
your ego so you

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.590 align:middle line:84%
can be more receptive to the
subtle herbs and a whole host

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:56.080 align:middle line:84%
of other different
visionary plants.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.038 align:middle line:84%
But in other traditions,
it could be a sweat lodge.

00:32:59.038 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:84%
Sweat lodge, for me, brings
up a lot of the same things

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.663 align:middle line:90%
that an ayahuasca ceremony does.

00:33:02.663 --> 00:33:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think the best part of the
mis-messaging around the spirit

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.350 align:middle line:84%
pathway now is that you need
to go down to the Amazon,

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.420 align:middle line:84%
or you need to go into
some remote culture

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and have the experience with a
shaman or the high priestess.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.270 align:middle line:84%
When looking at traditions
here in America that were

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:90%
here long before we got here--

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.560 align:middle line:90%
things like the sweat lodge--

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:90%
trigger the same stuff.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.120 align:middle line:84%
A really intense
sweat lodge can be

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.780 align:middle line:84%
just as or more transformational
than an ayahuasca ceremony.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:39.520 align:middle line:84%
What we've noticed is
in these traditions,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:84%
the real rites of passage are
planned intensity of some kind.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So planned intensity
of heat in a sweat

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:49.770 align:middle line:84%
lodge, planned intensity of
your entire psyche melting

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:84%
down which is an
ayahuasca ceremony.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just, how are
you going to do

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:84%
and what's going to be
triggered in your soul

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.040 align:middle line:84%
when the world around
you melts away,

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.038 align:middle line:84%
and you have to deal with
suffering for a while?

00:34:03.038 --> 00:34:04.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what ayahuasca is.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what sweat lodge is.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what a bunch of different
types of practices in the Far

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:90%
East are.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And doing that beforehand
or in conjunction

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
with herbal protocols and
energy healing protocols

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.492 align:middle line:90%
is what we see most.

00:34:18.492 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:10%
>> To me, it sounds like
a shocking way to boom,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:10%
force you out of the constructs
of the Western world.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It's like here's
a rite of passage.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Here's a way that we need
you to sort of partake

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.159 align:middle line:84%
in this activity to
sort of get you out

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:37.693 align:middle line:84%
of your domesticated-ness,
in a way.

00:34:37.693 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Would you say
that's sort of true?

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you're more open to
receiving healing from nature,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.169 align:middle line:90%
from within, et cetera.

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:45.761 align:middle line:84%
The shamans that I
worked with was actually

00:34:45.761 --> 00:34:48.920 align:middle line:84%
calling it a little shake up,
which is exactly what you said.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.590 align:middle line:84%
We just need a little shake
up, and then the healing

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.639 align:middle line:90%
will start.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You think that shamans
down in the jungle

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:01.250 align:middle line:84%
or in Siberia or Mongolia
who do these really, really

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.020 align:middle line:84%
intense ceremonies
on a regular basis

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.020 align:middle line:84%
to bring patients through
it must've figured out

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:84%
some way of bypassing it or
getting used to the intensity.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to shamans
before, especially

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.318 align:middle line:84%
one down in the
jungle named Roman.

00:35:17.318 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:84%
One night, I was
like, I don't really

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.443 align:middle line:84%
want to go in to the
ceremony tonight.

00:35:20.443 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just not my night.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.058 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want to
do it, basically saying

00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:25.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to suffer tonight.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:27.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm not interested
in suffering tonight.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
swinging in a hammock

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:84%
next to him and
him saying to me,

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:84%
do you think that
it's easy for me?

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, well, you've
done it 5,000 times.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it 5,000?

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And he's like
yeah, give or take.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:43.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to figure out some
mechanisms to kind of take

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.660 align:middle line:90%
a pass or get used to it.

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, every time
I walk toward that maloca--

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:52.150 align:middle line:84%
maloca is a ceremonial
temple in the jungle.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Every time I have to
go into that maloca,

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I have to leave my
ego at the door.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:90%
And there's always fear.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I've just gotten
used to the fear.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Before we go further afield,
away from "Sacred Science,"

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
we've got to cover the
thing that gets left out,

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.210 align:middle line:90%
the dude that died, right?

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Heavy, intense.

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I've heard a little
bit about the story.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.810 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about the patients.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.920 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
majority of them?

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And then let's cover what
happened with this gentleman

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:25.210 align:middle line:90%
that passed away.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Of the eight patients
we took down to the jungle,

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:84%
five came back
with real results.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Two came back disappointed.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.360 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get what
they wanted health wise.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And one didn't come back at all.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:41.590 align:middle line:84%
So of the five patients who
got what they came down for,

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:45.290 align:middle line:84%
we saw incredible improvement
with Parkinson's disease

00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:48.425 align:middle line:90%
which was astounding.

00:36:48.425 --> 00:36:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Of all the patients,
our patient Nikola

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:54.310 align:middle line:84%
was the one that I had the
most reservations about just

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.930 align:middle line:90%
because she was so advanced.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:57.370 align:middle line:90%
She could hardly talk.

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.680 align:middle line:90%
She could hardly walk.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Her body was fully clenched
up when she got there.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So that was amazing to
watch, and that all happened

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.890 align:middle line:84%
through a specific
plant ceremony

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that she did, which we could
talk about if you want to.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.120 align:middle line:90%
And then our cancer patients--

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.570 align:middle line:84%
so we had a pretty
amazing recovery

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
with John, who had
prostate cancer.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.240 align:middle line:90%
And we'll talk about Gary.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who
didn't make it back.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:84%
We saw pretty amazing
work with cancer.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We saw incredible
transformations

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.680 align:middle line:84%
with depression, anxiety,
and drug addiction.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:84%
We saw amazing progress
with digestive disorders

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.053 align:middle line:90%
like Crohn's and IBS.

00:37:39.053 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And then there
were a few patients

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.120 align:middle line:90%
that didn't do so well.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
One of our cancer patients
didn't get the results

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.090 align:middle line:90%
that she wanted.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Our breast cancer patient
didn't get the results

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:47.880 align:middle line:90%
that she wanted.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
we could look into and try

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.340 align:middle line:84%
to unpack, but it's hard
to really understand

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.290 align:middle line:84%
why something does
or doesn't work

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.750 align:middle line:90%
on a spiritual or herbal level.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.940 align:middle line:84%
You just watch and see
what's in front of you

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and kind of make up your
own analysis later on.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But Melinda didn't get the
results that she wanted.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.240 align:middle line:84%
One of our Crohn's
disease patients

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.150 align:middle line:84%
didn't get the results
that she wanted.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.775 align:middle line:84%
An interesting thing that we saw
in the patients, even the ones

00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that didn't get the physical
results they wanted,

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.630 align:middle line:84%
is every single one
of them said that it

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:84%
was the most transformational
experience they ever had.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And on a spiritual level, they
were completely different.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't me saying it or
even the shamans noticing it.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.910 align:middle line:84%
It's them telling us as they
left, thank you so much.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.550 align:middle line:90%
This changes everything for me.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So that was the nice thing
about even the patients that

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.750 align:middle line:84%
didn't get what
they wanted, seeing

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.450 align:middle line:84%
this deep, spiritual
transformation.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the one
who didn't make it back.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.870 align:middle line:90%
His name is Gary.

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.600 align:middle line:90%
He had neuroendocrine cancer.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't realize
this at the time

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:90%
because he kept this from us.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And in kind of a
cheeky way, which

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm really grateful
for actually,

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:59.080 align:middle line:84%
he didn't have
much time to live.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Neuroendocrine cancer
is the real deal.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was on an injection
that was the only thing that

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.360 align:middle line:84%
could kind of keep it under
control that's $5,000 a week,

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and his insurance
wasn't covering it.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.570 align:middle line:90%
So we were his last option.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And he came down and was by far
the coolest and most easygoing,

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.210 align:middle line:84%
the quickest to adapt to
that environment of any

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.320 align:middle line:90%
of the patients.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Was just absolutely loving it,
loving the whole experience,

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.850 align:middle line:90%
so grateful.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.367 align:middle line:84%
And making a lot of
progress in terms

00:39:32.367 --> 00:39:33.450 align:middle line:90%
of him getting down there.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.730 align:middle line:90%
He was in severe pain.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:39.570 align:middle line:84%
He had tumors all throughout
his intestines, and so just

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.510 align:middle line:90%
moving around for him was hard.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Just any simple movement--
standing up, sitting down,

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:90%
laying there--

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.440 align:middle line:84%
was all pain because there was
so much pressure down there.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And after five or six days,
all that pain went away.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And he called me into
his hut one night,

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and he's like, I
think it's gone.

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:00.940 align:middle line:90%
He goes, you don't understand.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:06.880 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been not in discomfort
in a very, very long time.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not on any
kind of medication

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.280 align:middle line:84%
besides the herbs
and the ceremonies,

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
any pain anymore.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:15.580 align:middle line:90%
So I think we have it on film.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.795 align:middle line:84%
It's actually in
the documentary.

00:40:17.795 --> 00:40:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember
going back that night

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.850 align:middle line:84%
and talking to
everyone in the crew

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and talking to a couple of
the shamans and being like,

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.260 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.220 align:middle line:90%
I think he's all right.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.880 align:middle line:84%
I think this is actually
working for him.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And three nights later,
we were in our longhouse.

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The crew has its own longhouse
in the middle of the woods.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And we were kind of just
logging footage and doing

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.400 align:middle line:84%
all the things you do,
cleaning up the gear,

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.110 align:middle line:84%
charging batteries,
and all that stuff.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And on the walkie-talkies
came through one of the aides.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.665 align:middle line:84%
Every night, there were two
or three different helpers

00:40:55.665 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
that would be walking
through the woods

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:84%
because these huts
are so far apart.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And just making sure
everyone's OK and just kind of,

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.570 align:middle line:90%
literally, like night walkers.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.945 align:middle line:84%
Just walking through, making
sure everyone was all right.

00:41:04.945 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And there was a walkie
talkie system that we use,

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.560 align:middle line:90%
and the walkie-talkie blew up.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like, Nick,
Roman, you need to come

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.790 align:middle line:90%
to hut number eight right away.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
man, what's that?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And I remember picking it up and
saying, hey, what's going on?

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:84%
They're like, you need
to come right away.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.380 align:middle line:90%
It's Gary.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.345 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my
heart just dropped.

00:41:26.345 --> 00:41:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I remember getting my boots on.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Dan, who's also part
of the film crew,

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:38.090 align:middle line:84%
got his boots on and was just
running through the woods--

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:84%
which is a kind of a dangerous
prospect in the Amazon.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Doing that at nighttime,
there's lots of snakes and stuff

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.900 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So usually, you're
kind of like head lamp,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.420 align:middle line:90%
looking around, seeing.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember Dan and
I running as fast

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:50.600 align:middle line:90%
as we could out the hut eight.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Met up with a couple
of the shamans, Edwin,

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and one of the other medical
staff was already out there.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And Gary was just sitting on his
little porch on his dieta hut.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a couple steps.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Sitting on the steps, and he's
just kind of breathing heavy.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.040 align:middle line:84%
He's wearing his
underwear, and there's

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.270 align:middle line:90%
a few people around him.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, hey,
what's going on, man?

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, I don't know.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Still super cheery,
even in those moments.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Still just trying to kind of
see the higher path in that.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.610 align:middle line:90%
He just had that same demeanor.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, I
just can't breathe.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:90%
It's hard for me to get air.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And then literally five
breaths from when I got there,

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:middle line:84%
he stopped being responsive
to what we were asking him.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he fell
over on the ground.

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the medical
staff started giving him CPR,

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and it was really,
really intense.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:84%
I hate to say it, but kind of an
amazing thing to be a part of.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.170 align:middle line:90%
We were out there with him.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.740 align:middle line:84%
He went from being with
us to not being with us.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And I remember after
he passed away,

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.110 align:middle line:84%
we brought him into the hut
and put a bunch of candles

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:21.910 align:middle line:90%
around him.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're just kind
of sitting there

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:27.040 align:middle line:84%
looking at each other,
probably six or seven of us.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And there was this feeling
where it wasn't like devastation

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:84%
or shock or horror
or whatever you

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.230 align:middle line:84%
might associate with someone
passing suddenly like that.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:42.040 align:middle line:84%
We were just holding
the space, and there

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.530 align:middle line:84%
was this amazing
thing that transpired

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
as whatever the transition was--
however you want to put it,

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:51.070 align:middle line:84%
spiritually-- occurred
where he was there

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and then he wasn't
there anymore.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And so after that happened, I
was like, what do we do now?

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.810 align:middle line:90%
What happens now?

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.740 align:middle line:90%
One of our patients died.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.090 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I didn't
think this might happen,

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:07.790 align:middle line:84%
because we only brought down
people who were really sick.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.430 align:middle line:84%
We didn't hedge our
bets and bring down

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:12.590 align:middle line:84%
people who had a paper
cut or something.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.625 align:middle line:90%
So I knew this might happen.

00:44:14.625 --> 00:44:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember sitting
there in the hut

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:84%
like, I have to call
his next of kin.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And so everyone
kind of cleared out.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Roman's like the head
shaman in the movie.

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:33.420 align:middle line:84%
He's also one of
my best friends.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.962 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
each other, and he's

00:44:34.962 --> 00:44:37.825 align:middle line:84%
like, I guess we have to
stay here with him tonight.

00:44:37.825 --> 00:44:38.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no, you go.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.732 align:middle line:90%
I'll stay here with him.

00:44:39.732 --> 00:44:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it was middle
of the night--

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.080 align:middle line:84%
2:00, 3:00 in the
morning-- and we

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.257 align:middle line:84%
had to kind of figure out the
arrangements the next day.

00:44:46.257 --> 00:44:47.590 align:middle line:90%
But I stayed with him all night.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember sitting in that
dieta hut with Gary laying there

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and a couple of
candles for five hours,

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.373 align:middle line:84%
just kind of sitting there
thinking about stuff.

00:44:55.373 --> 00:44:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Thinking about what
was going to happen.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Thinking about who he was.

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
It was such an
interesting night.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.032 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the most
amazing nights of my life,

00:45:03.032 --> 00:45:05.320 align:middle line:84%
just sitting in
that hut with him.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the
inevitable time came

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that next morning where I needed
to grab our satellite phone

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and call up Susan, his sister,
tell her what happened.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.543 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I don't
know how to do this.

00:45:22.543 --> 00:45:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do this.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to call someone--

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:84%
her brother came down here, and
she's close enough with him,

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:34.215 align:middle line:84%
clearly, that she's
his emergency contact.

00:45:34.215 --> 00:45:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:37.693 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I'm
going to do this.

00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember sitting there
for a while and saying,

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.980 align:middle line:84%
you know what, all you can
do is just step forward,

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.730 align:middle line:84%
just call her up,
and see what happens.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.320 align:middle line:90%
And so I called her up.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And I remember she
picked up the phone.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, hello?

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.330 align:middle line:90%
And it was always like this--

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.580 align:middle line:84%
she was laughing before I
even started talking to her,

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.240 align:middle line:84%
laughing and crying
at the same time.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.265 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, hi, is this Susan?

00:46:01.265 --> 00:46:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, yeah.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.550 align:middle line:90%
She's like, is he dead?

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, yeah,
he died last night.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And she's like--
she started crying.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry, blah, blah, blah.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, crying, crying.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.750 align:middle line:90%
And, like, I started crying.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:16.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, you know--

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:17.950 align:middle line:90%
we tried.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, there's
something I need to tell you.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.880 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what?

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:84%
She's like, we all
said goodbye to him

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.360 align:middle line:90%
before he came down there.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.090 align:middle line:84%
He only had like four or
five days left to live.

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:33.680 align:middle line:90%
He didn't tell you that?

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no, he
didn't tell me that.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.025 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, yeah, he wanted
to be with you guys so bad.

00:46:42.025 --> 00:46:43.650 align:middle line:84%
He's always wanted
to go to the Amazon.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.802 align:middle line:90%
And he just, you know--

00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:46.260 align:middle line:84%
he just felt like
this was for him,

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.552 align:middle line:90%
whether he made it back or not.

00:46:47.552 --> 00:46:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And so he knew he was
being a little sneaky,

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:52.860 align:middle line:84%
trying to make it seem like
he was better than he was.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But his whole family said
goodbye to him before he left.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.190 align:middle line:90%
So I knew he wasn't coming back.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:03.662 align:middle line:84%
She's like, I'm sorry that
this is a surprise to you.

00:47:03.662 --> 00:47:04.620 align:middle line:90%
And I started laughing.

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Because he was the coolest guy.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.992 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I totally get it.

00:47:06.992 --> 00:47:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I totally get why this
guy faked his way into--

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:12.320 align:middle line:84%
faked his way into
my healing retreat.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And so she and I started
talking about it.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, this
is all he wanted.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.130 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to come.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Once he knew you were
doing what you're doing,

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.640 align:middle line:84%
he just wanted to be
down there with you.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is
how he'd want to go.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So that went from being, like, a
really heavy thing, where I was

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:25.490 align:middle line:90%
like, how do we even do this?

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:26.290 align:middle line:90%
Is this over?

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:27.248 align:middle line:90%
Is the experiment over?

00:47:27.248 --> 00:47:32.240 align:middle line:84%
To being like, oh, got it,
this is all part of it.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.690 align:middle line:84%
This is all part of this
whole process, right?

00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:40.920 align:middle line:84%
To understand life, you
need to understand death.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was the biggest
lesson that came out of that.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, Gary--

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:49.160 align:middle line:90%
I remember Gary, now, of course.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.580 align:middle line:90%
He was a bundle of love, man.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.380 align:middle line:90%
He was fun.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.422 align:middle line:84%
He looked like the best
guy you had on that trip.

00:47:53.422 --> 00:47:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.820 align:middle line:90%
So you did an autopsy.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And you found out
that, actually, things

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.178 align:middle line:84%
had broken down, there
was massive improvement.

00:48:00.178 --> 00:48:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But that, potentially, is
what caused the death, right?

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So he suffered
from a thrombosis.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And they say that, with
that type of cancer,

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.870 align:middle line:84%
when you start
using something that

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.450 align:middle line:84%
dislodges the tumors-- which
can be a very good thing.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, it's part of it--

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that a byproduct of the process
of dissolving and dislodging

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:25.880 align:middle line:84%
the tumors that are associated
with that kind of cancer

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.650 align:middle line:90%
can lead to a clot.

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:30.025 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened for him.

00:48:30.025 --> 00:48:30.825 align:middle line:90%
It's funny.

00:48:30.825 --> 00:48:32.930 align:middle line:84%
As we were, you know,
taking the film around-- it

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.305 align:middle line:84%
was in a bunch of
film festivals.

00:48:34.305 --> 00:48:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And at a number of
them, there'd be

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.005 align:middle line:84%
rows of scientists
and doctors that

00:48:40.005 --> 00:48:42.620 align:middle line:84%
would be, you know, pretty
close to the front, watching.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was always waiting for
someone to kind of challenge me

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:48.560 align:middle line:90%
on, like, the Gary part.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Because he died.

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:52.593 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a doctor.

00:48:52.593 --> 00:48:53.510 align:middle line:90%
None of them ever did.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:49:00.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only time I ever
got an interesting response

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:03.710 align:middle line:84%
from a scientist in the audience
was someone raise their hand.

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't
understand this.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:08.095 align:middle line:84%
I think you kind
of got it wrong.

00:49:08.095 --> 00:49:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
what do you mean?

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:11.810 align:middle line:84%
She was like, well,
you kind of painted it

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:14.210 align:middle line:84%
as though it didn't
work for him.

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
part of the healing

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.870 align:middle line:84%
process with this
kind of cancer can

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:23.330 align:middle line:84%
be dangerous in
the exact same way

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.430 align:middle line:84%
that we experienced
with Gary, that it

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:29.530 align:middle line:84%
can lead to something like
that, an altercation like that.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that it
didn't work, necessarily.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:36.187 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it didn't
work for him in the way

00:49:36.187 --> 00:49:37.270 align:middle line:90%
that you thought it would.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:38.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it needed another herb.

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you needed to
be used in conjunction

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:42.340 align:middle line:84%
with a modern medicine
approach so that you

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.210 align:middle line:90%
could control that part of it.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:47.630 align:middle line:84%
But you're making it sound
like it failed him when

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:49.630 align:middle line:90%
it's possible that it didn't.

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It was another byproduct or a
side effect of the treatment

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:54.590 align:middle line:90%
that you saw.

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, pretty
amazing experience.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Definitely has catapulted you
into the world of, like, plant

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:03.480 align:middle line:90%
medicine, ayahuasca, ceremony.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
reaching more people now

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.440 align:middle line:90%
today than ever before.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I believe we're experiencing
a sort of renaissance

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.420 align:middle line:84%
of plant medicine,
more people looking

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.300 align:middle line:90%
towards plants to healing.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:19.290 align:middle line:84%
What's your experience and
take on the natural medicine

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:21.840 align:middle line:84%
chest of the Amazon and
these sort of cultures

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.220 align:middle line:84%
all around the world and how,
like, we're just beginning

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.615 align:middle line:90%
to scratch the surface on that?

00:50:27.615 --> 00:50:33.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are, conservatively,
80,000-plus species of plants

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:36.552 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle, the
Amazon Jungle, alone.

00:50:36.552 --> 00:50:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Of those 80,000-- and that
number continues to go up.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.145 align:middle line:84%
My ethnobotanist friends,
it seems like, every year,

00:50:41.145 --> 00:50:42.020 align:middle line:90%
they're finding more.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Even though the jungle's
being burned down,

00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:46.610 align:middle line:84%
they're finding even
more species of plants.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But of that 80,000 species of
plants, less than 3% of them

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.270 align:middle line:84%
have been studied for
the medicinal value.

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Of that 3%, a number
of modern medicines

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.140 align:middle line:90%
have been synthesized.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:50:59.940 align:middle line:90%
3%!

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.820 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we looking
at the other 97%?

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is true of the
world's rainforests.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:10.813 align:middle line:84%
25% of the most effective
cancer treatments

00:51:10.813 --> 00:51:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
in hospitals are

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:15.480 align:middle line:90%
derived from rainforest plants.

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.910 align:middle line:90%
So why are we not looking?

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Why are we not
exploring everything

00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:22.240 align:middle line:90%
that nature has to offer?

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:27.550 align:middle line:84%
The only practical reason
that I can see is money.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:29.820 align:middle line:90%
You can't patent plants.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So unless you can find something
that you can synthesize,

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:36.900 align:middle line:84%
a constituent that can
be reproduced in a lab,

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.380 align:middle line:90%
there's no money to be made.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:41.460 align:middle line:84%
In medicine, as we're all
starting to see-- big pharma,

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I think, is a concept that just
about everyone is aware of now.

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:46.720 align:middle line:90%
It's money.

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.930 align:middle line:90%
It start with money.

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a big business.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:58.380 align:middle line:84%
So until we start putting
value nature and its ability

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:02.740 align:middle line:84%
to heal us, and
until we deemphasize

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:06.470 align:middle line:84%
the monetary association
with health care,

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:09.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going
to see much exploration

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.986 align:middle line:90%
of the 97% of those plants.

00:52:11.986 --> 00:52:15.870 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem like
it's a wise business

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:84%
decision for
institutions that are

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.220 align:middle line:84%
bent on making as much
profit as they possibly can.

00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Well put.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't agree more.

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, in
your experience

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:29.810 align:middle line:84%
in working the shamans,
traveling in the Amazon,

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and visiting these
other cultures, as well,

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.145 align:middle line:84%
are there any stand-out
plants that you

00:52:33.145 --> 00:52:35.720 align:middle line:84%
see that they're using
that are just not

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.300 align:middle line:90%
yet even available to us?

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my gosh.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Our patient, Nicola, who
had Parkinson's disease,

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:49.100 align:middle line:84%
she did a two- or
three-day ceremony,

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:53.450 align:middle line:84%
I guess you'd call it, with a
plant called the toé, T-O-E,

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:57.630 align:middle line:84%
with an accent mark over the
E. The scientific name is

00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Brugmansia grandiflora.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's known in the Amazon
to work with neurological

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:06.300 align:middle line:90%
disorders like Parkinson's.

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.100 align:middle line:90%
It's intense.

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It's highly ceremonial in the
sense that you can't just be

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:13.260 align:middle line:84%
toé and go about
your normal day.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.410 align:middle line:90%
It's vision-inducing.

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:17.330 align:middle line:90%
It's psychoactive.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But the shamans in the jungle
that work with neurological

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.930 align:middle line:84%
disorders swear by it for
its effect on conditions like

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Parkinson's.

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And watching her go
through two days of that,

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:31.570 align:middle line:84%
and what she looked
like going in,

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:33.612 align:middle line:84%
and what she looked like
coming up the other end,

00:53:33.612 --> 00:53:37.450 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most jaw-dropping
feats of natural medicine

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:39.190 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever witnessed.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:41.620 align:middle line:90%
She was so clenched.

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And she was so rigid and tremory
that she could barely talk.

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.200 align:middle line:84%
You didn't understand-- it
was very hard to understand

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.210 align:middle line:90%
what she was saying.

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And after she had sat with
the toé shaman for two days,

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:02.530 align:middle line:84%
seeing her walk out by herself
without the use of the cane,

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:08.650 align:middle line:84%
seeing her doing
jumping jacks afterward,

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.423 align:middle line:90%
and hearing for the first time--

00:54:10.423 --> 00:54:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't think any of us realized
that she had an English accent.

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:16.285 align:middle line:84%
Because her voice had been
so clenched and tremory.

00:54:16.285 --> 00:54:20.357 align:middle line:84%
And her eloquent, amazing,
fluid speech afterward.

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And just was watching
her walk around,

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and be like in this new body all
of a sudden after working with

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.550 align:middle line:90%
toé was humbling.

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.810 align:middle line:90%
It was remarkable.

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's one plant.

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's one plant.

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.840 align:middle line:90%
It would never be legal here.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It might be legal here
soon, given the trend,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.710 align:middle line:84%
as we're seeing with
cannabis, and now

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.980 align:middle line:90%
psilocybin, here in Colorado.

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:48.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
be legal for a while.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Because it's so psychoactive.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's also dangerous.

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I guess, part of our
distrust of nature, maybe,

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.810 align:middle line:84%
as human beings, is,
you know, we sort of

00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.760 align:middle line:84%
survive by not eating
the wrong stuff.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we might have
this ingrained in us, like, you

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:04.327 align:middle line:84%
know, a little bit of a
distrust, a little bit

00:55:04.327 --> 00:55:06.090 align:middle line:84%
of awareness around
just trusting

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:09.310 align:middle line:84%
these plants in nature that
we've never experienced before.

00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:12.988 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the people who
survive the genetic lines, that

00:55:12.988 --> 00:55:15.030 align:middle line:84%
survived, are the ones
that knew how to stay away

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:17.370 align:middle line:84%
from poisonous
foods, and how not

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:20.430 align:middle line:84%
to stray too far away
from the fire, you know?

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So wandering into the
depths of the woods

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to start experimenting
with these exotic plants

00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know
about is almost,

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:31.160 align:middle line:84%
from a genetic standpoint,
you know, wired into us.

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:33.997 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, this stuff all
over here, it might kill me,

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.080 align:middle line:90%
it might give me diabetes.

00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But I know it's not necessarily
poisonous, you know?

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:42.340 align:middle line:90%
It's just one plant.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.960 align:middle line:90%
But it's dangerous.

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these really,
really hyper-effective plants

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Amazon that
we've seen, they

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.880 align:middle line:90%
need to be used the right way.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:53.960 align:middle line:84%
They need to be prepared
in the right manner.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And the dose is
really important.

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So with toé, if you use
it in the wrong dose,

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.180 align:middle line:90%
you can go blind.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.110 align:middle line:90%
You can die.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:04.648 align:middle line:90%
You can lose your mind.

00:56:04.648 --> 00:56:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's not much
different than what

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:12.150 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing with this abuse
of pharmaceutical drugs.

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:13.738 align:middle line:84%
It's actually not
different at all.

00:56:13.738 --> 00:56:15.030 align:middle line:90%
How many drug deaths are there?

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:17.870 align:middle line:84%
How many unintended
pharmaceutical-related deaths

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:20.040 align:middle line:90%
are there every year?

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just about
understanding the dose,

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.120 align:middle line:84%
understanding how to
respect the plant.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I like
the most about these plants

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is that they're not just
good at covering up symptoms.

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:30.750 align:middle line:90%
They're curative.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:35.720 align:middle line:84%
They actually heal you as
opposed to enabling you to live

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:36.720 align:middle line:90%
with a health condition.

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.658 align:middle line:90%
They have a curative effect.

00:56:39.658 --> 00:56:43.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool, amazing, really.

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:44.480 align:middle line:90%
You brought up cannabis.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a really
good case in point.

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we've seen a plant
that has been essentially

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:54.710 align:middle line:90%
under lock and key.

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's a felony to
be caught with it.

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:59.930 align:middle line:84%
People have been
incarcerated for using it.

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And now, all of a
sudden, it's just

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:05.060 align:middle line:84%
available medicinally
and recreationally almost

00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:06.470 align:middle line:90%
overnight.

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- you know, the THC
component can cause a high,

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.300 align:middle line:90%
or I guess--

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if you'd
label it "psychoactive."

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:19.575 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's your forte.

00:57:19.575 --> 00:57:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the CBD can
be really healing.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And we've got these cannabinoid
receptors in the body.

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.600 align:middle line:84%
To me, I see that plant
as an opportunity for us

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.330 align:middle line:84%
to open up the sort of
floodgates of more medicine.

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it's being brought
to the market in a way where

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.340 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of regulated
a little bit more.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:41.210 align:middle line:84%
There's, you know-- it has to
test as free from pesticides.

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's, you
know, companies that

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:44.990 align:middle line:84%
are using certain
strains of plants that

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:middle line:84%
have different
percentages of CBD

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to THC in order to affect a
more healing sort of approach

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:51.920 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, do you think that
this is leading the way?

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And where do you see
herbal medicine and plant

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.232 align:middle line:90%
medicine in the future?

00:58:00.232 --> 00:58:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Cannabis is
fascinating to me.

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Because it indicates to me that
the masses are starting to say,

00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:09.990 align:middle line:90%
enough is enough.

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Can only be failed by modern
medicine for so many years

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:17.580 align:middle line:84%
until you start asking questions
about what else is out there.

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I think cannabis is
definitely paving the way.

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, until
recently, it was not

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:24.180 align:middle line:84%
available to be
studied in universities

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.630 align:middle line:90%
because of legality issues.

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But over the last few
decades, now, we're

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:29.670 align:middle line:90%
starting to dig into it.

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing the
importance of the ECS,

00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:35.030 align:middle line:84%
or the endocannabinoid
system, and how

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that controls pain, or at
least effects heavily pain,

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:44.480 align:middle line:84%
appetite, sleep
cycles, exercise.

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of those
that is front and center.

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And once people realize
the power of cannabis

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and the different
constituents to heal the body,

00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:55.880 align:middle line:84%
it's going to open up
the opportunity for us

00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to look at all the other
plants, whether they're

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.710 align:middle line:84%
psychoactive like
psilocybin and its effects

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:04.040 align:middle line:84%
with trauma and
end-of-life issues,

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.065 align:middle line:84%
or whether we're just
talking about chamomile.

00:59:06.065 --> 00:59:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's all
kinds of plants out there

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.710 align:middle line:84%
that have incredible
healing value.

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
somewhere along the line,

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:14.560 align:middle line:90%
we wrote them off.

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Screw that!

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:20.160 align:middle line:90%
Bring it back, right?

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.600 align:middle line:90%
That was awesome.

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't agree more.

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.745 align:middle line:84%
Do you see anything on the
radar in terms of what's next

00:59:25.745 --> 00:59:28.620 align:middle line:84%
or what big herbal plan that
people are going to be doing?

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Or probably even
a better question

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.210 align:middle line:84%
is, how can people
introduce some

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of this sort of plant medicine
sort of treasure trove

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.100 align:middle line:84%
that we have into
their daily life?

00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you do it?

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.154 align:middle line:84%
How do you recommend
people do it?

00:59:42.154 --> 00:59:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So with plants, the nice
thing about a lot of the herbs

00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.430 align:middle line:84%
that we use here in my house
is that they grow here.

00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:49.510 align:middle line:84%
They grow-- I mean,
there's plants

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that are extremely
good for your body that

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.110 align:middle line:90%
grow on your front lawn.

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I have dandelions
growing on my front lawn.

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:59.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a little-- my wife might
not want me to admit that.

00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But dandelions are
extremely medicinal.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.390 align:middle line:90%
We look at them as weeds.

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:08.110 align:middle line:84%
They are extremely good
at detoxifying our liver.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:12.700 align:middle line:84%
They're something that's been
used for thousands of years

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.020 align:middle line:90%
to help our body heal itself.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And here they are sprouting
up all over our lawns

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and asking for us to
start imbibing them.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think that a
lot of the Arabs

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
that we could use and could
be the most benefit to us

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:29.290 align:middle line:90%
grow in our yards.

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:30.440 align:middle line:90%
They grow around us.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.120 align:middle line:90%
They grow right down the road.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You can find them
at Whole Foods.

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So I like to use herbs starting
off just herbs that taste good,

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:41.620 align:middle line:84%
that I could put my food, like
dandelion greens, you know?

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:42.190 align:middle line:90%
You could put that into a salad.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:43.480 align:middle line:90%
You could put it into a soup.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.280 align:middle line:90%
It's delicious.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
It's also going to help
detoxify your body.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.213 align:middle line:90%
I also love medicinal mushrooms.

01:00:49.213 --> 01:00:51.005 align:middle line:84%
And I think that those
are starting to make

01:00:51.005 --> 01:00:52.270 align:middle line:90%
a big comeback right now too--

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:53.070 align:middle line:90%
not even comeback.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:54.153 align:middle line:90%
They were never even here.

01:00:54.153 --> 01:00:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they're starting
to make a big entrance

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
onto the world stage of what's
available, dietarily speaking,

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:05.020 align:middle line:84%
to help not only spruce up your
meals, but also heal your body.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So we use a lot of
medicinal mushrooms.

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.072 align:middle line:90%
And they also grow around here.

01:01:08.072 --> 01:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And most places, you'll
find some species

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
of medicinal mushroom
that can be harvested that

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:14.550 align:middle line:90%
can benefit you in some way.

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:18.480 align:middle line:84%
My friend Daniel Vitalis says
that the herbs we need most

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.620 align:middle line:90%
tend to sprout up around us.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds almost
like an old-wives tale

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
or a nice little way
of a little myth,

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and a nice way of thinking about
nature, and just a good story.

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.190 align:middle line:90%
But it's really interesting.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before, dandelions
sprouting up outside my door.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
They sprout up outside
everyone's door here

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:38.100 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And guess what the
most toxicified culture

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.890 align:middle line:90%
is in the world?

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:42.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the United States!

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Our diets are full of
toxins, pesticides.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And all sudden this
medicine that's

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
the most perfect
medicine that nature

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
has to offer us to
detoxify our system

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is sprouting up everywhere,
asking us to eat it?

01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:57.985 align:middle line:84%
So in my opinion, the more
you start dancing with herbs,

01:01:57.985 --> 01:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
the more you start understanding
the subtleties of nature

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
around you, the more
you start realizing

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
that the medicine you need
is often growing in your town

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:10.213 align:middle line:90%
or available in your town.

01:02:10.213 --> 01:02:11.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to go
down to the Amazon.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to travel
into the Sahara Desert,

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.590 align:middle line:84%
to some far-off oasis, to
find the medicine you need.

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:21.074 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, it's growing
in your neighborhood.

01:02:21.074 --> 01:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> But shouldn't we just be
spraying those herbs with

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:25.375 align:middle line:90%
Roundup?

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that the best
thing to do, right?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:27.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what I see.

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I love the word "weed."

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting
that we just kind of--

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
there's some plants
that are actually

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.080 align:middle line:84%
really good at surviving in
really harsh conditions, which

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
an ethnobotanist would
tell you that some

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of the most medicinal
plants are the ones that

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
are able to survive in
the harshest environments,

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.380 align:middle line:90%
a lot of those alkaline plants.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
We look for alkaloids and
plants to find out, you know,

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.370 align:middle line:90%
what they're good for.

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.245 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, the
most medicinal plants

01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:53.180 align:middle line:90%
are the most alkaline plants.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
plants are growing only

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:57.060 align:middle line:90%
in harsh conditions.

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting to see

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.323 align:middle line:84%
plants that survive our Roundup,
and survive the pesticides,

01:03:02.323 --> 01:03:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and still sprout
up all around us.

01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:05.626 align:middle line:90%
What medicine do they have?

01:03:05.626 --> 01:03:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I think, you know, that there's
that ancient term, you know,

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:09.870 align:middle line:90%
"bitter medicine."

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.980 align:middle line:90%
You know, alkaline is bitter.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Also, just the concept
that you've mused on before

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.333 align:middle line:84%
is, like, everything
is medicine, right?

01:03:19.333 --> 01:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love you
to speak to that.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, also,
emotionally, and sort of

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
from a nutrition
perspective, as well,

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, we're either
healing or harming ourselves,

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and how to use the
experiences in our life

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.547 align:middle line:90%
as an opportunity to heal.

01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:38.380 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean by
this concept, everything

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:41.120 align:middle line:90%
is medicine?

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So we tend to
go through life,

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
especially in our
WEIRD American culture,

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:48.777 align:middle line:90%
with some far-off goal.

01:03:48.777 --> 01:03:49.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to suffer.

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:50.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:51.622 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to keep my head down.

01:03:51.622 --> 01:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, at some point,
I'm going to have arrived.

01:03:55.670 --> 01:04:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
the crises that we face,

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a midlife
crisis, what have you,

01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
is when we realize, oh,
the cavalry isn't coming.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.670 align:middle line:90%
I've been working so hard.

01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I've been fighting
so hard for this.

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And all there is more of this.

01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:19.540 align:middle line:90%
There is no finish line.

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.500 align:middle line:90%
It's the biggest myth.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
That idea of a finish
line is the biggest myth

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.640 align:middle line:90%
that we're told.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The idea that
everything is medicine

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
is a way of
re-envisioning your day

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
to look at everything
that happens

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
as an opportunity
for personal growth.

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So at the core of
that philosophy

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
is the notion that a challenge
can be looked at either poison

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:47.740 align:middle line:90%
or medicine.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
medicines are poison.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of dose, right?

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So everything is
medicine means that when

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
you get into a car accident this
morning on your way to work,

01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:05.110 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to trying
to take a pass,

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and yelling at the
person in the other car,

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.535 align:middle line:84%
and starting to get in your head
about the fact that, you know,

01:05:10.535 --> 01:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
things aren't going
your way this week,

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and what's your boss going to
think, you center yourself,

01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and you look at it as a bunch
of information that is now

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
surrounding you,
that is beckoning

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
you to rise to the
occasion, to evolve, to look

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.420 align:middle line:84%
at the darknesses maybe
inside you that it triggered.

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Acknowledge them.

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:33.045 align:middle line:84%
And then move forward in the
highest way you know how to.

01:05:33.045 --> 01:05:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a way of looking at your
life not as some kind of a game

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that has an end but as
this ongoing evolution.

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And look at your
challenges as medicine,

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
not as some kind of a poison or
inconvenience that now is going

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:54.680 align:middle line:90%
to derail your day somehow.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I guess by looking at your
day as a spiritual obstacle

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:00.520 align:middle line:90%
course--

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.320 align:middle line:90%
we go to the gym.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.090 align:middle line:90%
We kind of use weight.

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:03.590 align:middle line:84%
We kind of use
resistance training.

01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And want to strengthen
a tonify our bodies.

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
resistance in our reality,

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
we kind of shy away from it or
we recoil as if this is somehow

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
an inconvenience
that we want to learn

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:20.150 align:middle line:90%
how to avoid at all costs.

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But what if you saw
your inconvenience

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
as that same
resistance training?

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
What if you saw your screaming
two-year-old son who's

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to get your attention
while the bank's calling you

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
to talk to you about the
mortgage that, you know,

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
you may or may not get on the
house that you really need,

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:39.150 align:middle line:84%
what if you see that
as resistance training

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to some
part of your life

01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
that you need to just hold
your nose and get through?

01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what I mean by that
philosophy of everything

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.670 align:middle line:90%
is medicine.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
In that manner,
you're not looking

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:54.182 align:middle line:84%
at this mountain you're
climbing as the only mountain.

01:06:54.182 --> 01:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
You're just learning
how to climb better.

01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:57.682 align:middle line:84%
And you know once you
get to the top of it,

01:06:57.682 --> 01:07:00.562 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be 17 more
peaks that are staring at you.

01:07:00.562 --> 01:07:01.770 align:middle line:90%
And you get excited for them.

01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:03.895 align:middle line:84%
Because you're getting
better at learning how to be

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:07.220 align:middle line:90%
comfortable with discomfort.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> We've become
domesticated, really.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
We've become so
conditioned to comfort

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.630 align:middle line:84%
that, when any
challenge comes, we're

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:16.347 align:middle line:84%
reaching for a prescription, or
reaching for an antidepressant.

01:07:16.347 --> 01:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's statistics
showing that, you know,

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:20.620 align:middle line:84%
22 million people are
taking antidepressants daily

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.850 align:middle line:90%
in the US.

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:24.238 align:middle line:84%
That's a significant
percentage of the population.

01:07:24.238 --> 01:07:26.530 align:middle line:84%
If we think, as a Western
culture, we've won that race,

01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
we're pretty far
off the map, right?

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so true.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.747 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The best thing that
have ever happened to me

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:36.610 align:middle line:84%
have happened in the
face of challenge.

01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.450 align:middle line:84%
In terms of-- And I think that
that's a lot of the population.

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
When you think of the best
stories that you ever hear,

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, the things
that books are made of

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.555 align:middle line:90%
are steeped in challenge.

01:07:46.555 --> 01:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're people who
rose to the occasion.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's weird.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Because, these days, we like
to watch that on television.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want any
of it in our own life.

01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:57.427 align:middle line:90%
Where did all the heroes go?

01:07:57.427 --> 01:07:58.510 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the hero?

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
person who had some grit,

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and was able to see
something challenging,

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and turn their ship into the
storm, as opposed to trying

01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to navigate around it using
some kind of pharmaceutical

01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:14.530 align:middle line:84%
or whatever your drug
of choice might be?

01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it time for us to sit here
and hold space for the reality

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
around us, to stop shying
away from inconvenience,

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:27.686 align:middle line:84%
from challenge, and learn
how to celebrate it?

01:08:27.686 --> 01:08:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And you think plants
can help you do that?

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:34.149 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
are some definite--

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:35.649 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
call them shortcuts.

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's some definite
allies in this philosophy

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.729 align:middle line:84%
of everything is
medicine to make it,

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:44.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say easier,
but definitely more doable

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.029 align:middle line:90%
to get started on.

01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:47.479 align:middle line:90%
One of them is using herbs.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I like to use a category
of herbs called adaptogens

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that are known to be great at
modulating stress in the body.

01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:57.939 align:middle line:84%
I eat reishi mushroom
on a regular basis.

01:08:57.939 --> 01:08:58.960 align:middle line:90%
I put it in tinctures.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.130 align:middle line:90%
I make teas out of it.

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It helps me do things
that I would otherwise

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
be uncomfortable about doing,
like step onto a stage in front

01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people
and talk about shamanism,

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:11.844 align:middle line:90%
let's just say.

01:09:11.844 --> 01:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
It might not feel
that comfortable.

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:17.859 align:middle line:84%
But with the right plant
allies, as they're commonly

01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:20.529 align:middle line:84%
referred to in
different cultures,

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:23.910 align:middle line:84%
the right plant ally will
give you a subtle advantage.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:28.149 align:middle line:84%
It'll help keep your system
in a state of homeostasis

01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
even when the
environment around you

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:33.370 align:middle line:90%
gets a little bit more intense.

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:36.675 align:middle line:84%
So I highly recommend
starting to use herbs

01:09:36.675 --> 01:09:39.609 align:middle line:84%
and finding that right,
subtle herb for you.

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:41.430 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's reishi mushroom.

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:45.109 align:middle line:84%
It's another herb called
skullcap and a third herb

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:47.040 align:middle line:90%
called ashwagandha.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.439 align:middle line:84%
They all have their
own unique qualities.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:53.398 align:middle line:84%
And they are perfect for
my own unique physiology.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some
things you can't get past.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
You can definitely evolve
as a spirit, as a soul,

01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:59.870 align:middle line:90%
at least in my eyes.

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Some things, genetically,
are just there.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So how do you use
herbs to try to right

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:10.080 align:middle line:84%
some of the genetic expressions
that might not be helping you.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I've been
really into these days,

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.630 align:middle line:84%
is I use ashwagandha
and I use skullcap.

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it helps to quiet the
chatter in my brain and also

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:24.870 align:middle line:84%
boost the tone, for lack of
a better word, of who I am.

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So skullcap grows in the
forests along streams.

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't grow along
anywhere on the stream.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
It grows along the
parts of the stream that

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:40.340 align:middle line:84%
are the most rough, the
babbling parts, the parts that

01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.850 align:middle line:84%
are really, really, really,
you know, turbid, I guess,

01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:45.800 align:middle line:90%
is a good word for it.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.160 align:middle line:84%
You'll find that that's
where the skullcap will be,

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.660 align:middle line:90%
sprouting up and loving it.

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:51.830 align:middle line:90%
So herbalists look at this.

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And they say, well, you
know, a lot of times

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
the external environment mimics
our internal environment.

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So in the woods, if we're
looking at a stream,

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:03.240 align:middle line:84%
what plants are growing
close to the most rough parts

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.040 align:middle line:90%
of that stream?

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.748 align:middle line:84%
And what could they
possibly be good for?

01:11:05.748 --> 01:11:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So I've had it told me by a
couple different herbalists

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.477 align:middle line:84%
that the reason
why skullcap works

01:11:09.477 --> 01:11:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to quiet the mental
chatter in your brain

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
is closely synced up to exactly
what it's doing on that stream.

01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It love loves to grow right
near a lot of babbling,

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.690 align:middle line:90%
a lot of extra energy happening.

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
take skullcap, it

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
has this way of--
not pacifying you.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's not in any way
dulling your senses.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But it just somehow
quiets the noise.

01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here has a
ticker tape of thought

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.370 align:middle line:84%
running across
their consciousness

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
behind their eyeballs
at all times.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
even the best meditators

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:45.110 align:middle line:84%
in the world, the masters,
they know it's real.

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:46.182 align:middle line:90%
They're not beyond it.

01:11:46.182 --> 01:11:47.390 align:middle line:90%
They've learned to accept it.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:48.432 align:middle line:90%
And they can turn it off.

01:11:48.432 --> 01:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And they can be OK with
it when it comes back on.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.437 align:middle line:90%
But it's always there.

01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to be some
kind of ticker tape of thought.

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And so getting an advantage
on that ticker tape

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:02.750 align:middle line:84%
through meditation, through
herbs, other practices,

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I think, is a huge part of
living this life of purpose

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the world
as ripe with medicine.

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:13.070 align:middle line:84%
So the skullcap
really does a good job

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:15.530 align:middle line:90%
of quieting that ticker tape.

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And ashwagandha does sort
of a complimentary thing

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:21.068 align:middle line:90%
of boosting the true you.

01:12:21.068 --> 01:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
That's how it's been
told me by herbalists.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
beautiful part of herbalism

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
is, you start getting
into herbalism,

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
there's great science to
support all this stuff.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
You could find science to
support these same functions

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:33.290 align:middle line:84%
from a medical
perspective in the brain.

01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
But an herbalist
will also tell you,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.300 align:middle line:84%
it's more of the soul behind
that herb, which I personally

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.650 align:middle line:90%
really resonate with.

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So ashwagandha's really
good at supporting you.

01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's good at lifting
you up without it

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.160 align:middle line:90%
being a stimulant like coffee.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It's good at boosting your
tone, the who that you want

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:53.090 align:middle line:90%
to have show up in the world.

01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
It's good at doing that without
giving you any jittery energy.

01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So combining ashwagandha
with skullcap

01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:01.610 align:middle line:84%
is a really, really
nice thing to do.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Because it boosts you.

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
But it also kind of turns the
volume down on all the noise.

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So I use that along with an
adaptogen like reishi, which

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:10.550 align:middle line:90%
is great at modulating stress.

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:13.385 align:middle line:84%
And it allows me
to live that life.

01:13:13.385 --> 01:13:14.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool stories.

01:13:14.562 --> 01:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I really love that
stuff, actually.

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.937 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad we got there.

01:13:16.937 --> 01:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Because in the herbalism
world-- and I've

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.390 align:middle line:84%
been sort of taught
this about Podachae,

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
as well, shamans will just
be walking through the woods.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.460 align:middle line:84%
They're like, why is
that tree not rotting?

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, if you have a damp,
fungal sort of thing going on,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.743 align:middle line:84%
take the tree that never
rots, and it will help you

01:13:32.743 --> 01:13:33.660 align:middle line:90%
with the fungal thing.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it sort of
mitigates that-- like,

01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:40.020 align:middle line:84%
do you have any other examples
of cool stories about plants

01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that have these crazy
sort of characteristics

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:44.985 align:middle line:84%
in the jungle that get
acknowledged and then,

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:46.360 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden
now, we're, like,

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.730 align:middle line:90%
scientifically validating that?

01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a plant
called chiric sanango,

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.630 align:middle line:90%
also known as the 1,000 needles.

01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:53.430 align:middle line:90%
In the jungle.

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
It's really, really good
for neurological disorders.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:00.495 align:middle line:84%
When you take it, you
feel as though there

01:14:00.495 --> 01:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
are thousands of
needles starting

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:05.270 align:middle line:90%
to poke into your skin.

01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:06.983 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
good at stimulating

01:14:06.983 --> 01:14:08.900 align:middle line:84%
parts of the body that
might have been damaged

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.500 align:middle line:90%
by a neurological disorder.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.230 align:middle line:90%
So you see people take it.

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
psychoactive, necessarily.

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But it does create
sensation that could almost

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.220 align:middle line:90%
be perceived as real.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
If you had your
eyes closed, you'd

01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
think that there were,
not necessarily needles

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
poking into you, but you'd
feel them right up against you.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.935 align:middle line:84%
And they're really great at
stimulating the nerve endings

01:14:29.935 --> 01:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
all throughout your
body, which make

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
it kind of a go-to herb for
certain neurological disorders.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me think of another one.

01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:42.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a substance use in the
jungle called Sangre de Grado,

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:44.150 align:middle line:90%
or Blood of Dragon.

01:14:44.150 --> 01:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And the way you get it
is by taking a machete

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and chopping into
the side of the tree.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.240 align:middle line:90%
You don't kill it.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.907 align:middle line:84%
You just chop into
the side of the tree.

01:14:51.907 --> 01:14:53.810 align:middle line:90%
And then it weeps this--

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:56.840 align:middle line:90%
it oozes what looks like blood.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
When you rub it in
between your fingers,

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
it turns into kind of a latex
feeling, which turns out

01:15:05.050 --> 01:15:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to be extremely beneficial
for digestive disorders

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:10.300 align:middle line:84%
like Crohn's disease,
where you have lesions

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.040 align:middle line:90%
along your digestive track.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.080 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you
drink Sangre de Grado.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And it actually forms a coating
along the inside of your body.

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And that latex actually starts
plugging up some of those holes

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't
have that same pain

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and you're not leaking
fluid into your body

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.110 align:middle line:90%
cavity from your gut.

01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
But Sangre de Grado, it's also
extremely good for your blood,

01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:32.610 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:33.850 align:middle line:90%
You see that a lot in nature.

01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:36.430 align:middle line:84%
These really
deep-red plants tend

01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to have this association
with the blood, which

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.837 align:middle line:84%
is fascinating from a doctrine
of signature's perspective.

01:15:42.837 --> 01:15:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And some people believe in this.

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:44.970 align:middle line:90%
Some people don't.

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But the doctrine of signatures,
which is that a plant looks

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.300 align:middle line:90%
like what it's good for.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's been proven and
disproven left and right.

01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:54.310 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times,
it's spot on, especially

01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:55.240 align:middle line:90%
with Sangre de Grado.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.365 align:middle line:90%
Really good for your blood.

01:15:56.365 --> 01:16:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Really good at plugging
up holes along your gut.

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Something that fascinates
me about ayahuasca

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that is one of those mysteries
that can't really be explained

01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
is that ayahuasca
is a combination

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:11.050 align:middle line:90%
of two different plants.

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:14.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a vine called
the Banisteriopsis caapi.

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:17.170 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a
plant called chacruna.

01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The banisteriopsis
is an MAO inhibitor,

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
or it contains MAO
inhibitor constituents.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And the chacruna is
a DMT-rich plant.

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
You combine them.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And you boil them together
for a number of hours.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, you
put in other leaves

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
here and there to kind
of achieve other effects.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:39.370 align:middle line:10%
And then that turns into this
extremely psychoactive brew

01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:41.960 align:middle line:10%
that has been used in the
Amazon for thousands of years.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Except for the fact that the
Banisteriopsis caapi vine,

01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:52.110 align:middle line:90%
it grows way over here.

01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:54.383 align:middle line:84%
And the chacruna plant
is just a little leaf.

01:16:54.383 --> 01:16:56.550 align:middle line:84%
It looks like any other
possible leaf in the jungle.

01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:57.870 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing fancy about it.

01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not bright orange with
like pyramid shapes on it.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a
normal ivy leaf.

01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It grows 500 to 1,000 miles
away in a different ecosystem.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:14.190 align:middle line:84%
How is it that these people,
these primitives, right,

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:17.220 align:middle line:84%
these savages, you know, the way
that we might look at them from

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:21.600 align:middle line:84%
our social studies books growing
up in high school and whatever,

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
how would they know to harvest
that Banisteriopsis caapi vine,

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
harvest this one
little leaf over here,

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and brew them together, when
there's, like we said before,

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
80,000-plus species
of plants in between?

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:40.570 align:middle line:90%
How did they know that?

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:43.670 align:middle line:90%
How did they know to do that?

01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:44.780 align:middle line:90%
I have no answer.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.280 align:middle line:90%
But it's one of those mysteries.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.620 align:middle line:90%
This is really interesting.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Did these people try every
single plant combination?

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.410 align:middle line:84%
There would be a lot of
deaths if they did that.

01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Or was there some other
deeper connection to the Earth

01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're just starting
to tap back into?

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:02.835 align:middle line:84%
When you work with
ayahuasca in the jungle,

01:18:02.835 --> 01:18:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and you start working
with the shamans,

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:06.920 align:middle line:84%
understanding how they do
their work, a lot of them

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.580 align:middle line:84%
rely on those ceremonies to find
the next plants they're going

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%
to use for their patients.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I've seen shamans sit in
ceremony, ayahuasca ceremony,

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:19.610 align:middle line:90%
or San Pedro ceremony.

01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're finding in
their visions in the jungle

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:26.213 align:middle line:84%
the plants they know a
certain person needs.

01:18:26.213 --> 01:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And they can't even tell
you what it's called.

01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:29.030 align:middle line:90%
They just know that's the one.

01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:30.905 align:middle line:84%
And they brew it up to
give it to the person.

01:18:30.905 --> 01:18:32.330 align:middle line:90%
The person gets better.

01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:33.560 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on there?

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is where
we get a little bit woo.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And I try really hard to stay
away from woo in my work.

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's kind of
inherent in shamanism.

01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Always try to stay with science.

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But when you start seeing the
way that these cultures connect

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.260 align:middle line:84%
to nature and rely
on that connection

01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:53.480 align:middle line:84%
to find cures that are,
later, scientifically

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.860 align:middle line:90%
validated, what does that mean?

01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:00.426 align:middle line:84%
What piece of the
puzzle are we missing?

01:19:00.426 --> 01:19:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> With ayahuasca in particular,
it's got a bit of a tainted

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:07.830 align:middle line:90%
sort of PR spin.

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:11.363 align:middle line:84%
Because people take it as an
experience or a party drug.

01:19:11.363 --> 01:19:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And not everyone
always takes it--

01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
really a party drug.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.577 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people drink it,
throw up, and have all sorts

01:19:16.577 --> 01:19:17.910 align:middle line:90%
of crazy experiences, right?

01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:19.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty extreme.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm yet to try it.

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.955 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'll find my right
guide, and potentially--

01:19:22.955 --> 01:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
but for most people
I know who've

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
taken, incredible
experiences of unraveling

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
their emotional history,
finding a new authentic part

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:34.770 align:middle line:84%
of themselves, in a way,
becoming a renunciate,

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.620 align:middle line:84%
giving up the ways of the
world and focusing more

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
on heart-centered
way of being, like,

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:42.780 align:middle line:90%
some radical transformations.

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go a little
bit more into what

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.360 align:middle line:84%
is being studied around it,
what's effective about it,

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:49.650 align:middle line:90%
what are people using it for?

01:19:49.650 --> 01:19:53.764 align:middle line:84%
Because I know this is a sort
of area of speciality for you.

01:19:53.764 --> 01:19:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, ayahuasca is being
looked at for its effectiveness

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.130 align:middle line:90%
in treating addiction.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:05.168 align:middle line:84%
And what they're finding, not
from a chemical perspective,

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
but from an experiential
perspective,

01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:08.780 align:middle line:90%
is it's very effective.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.320 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
How does imbibing one plant
change 10 years of addiction

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.830 align:middle line:90%
to a specific substance?

01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The only way I can
explain it is through what

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced in my
own journeys of ayahuasca,

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:27.250 align:middle line:90%
which is that it is ego death.

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:29.855 align:middle line:84%
And ego death sounds great
when you're in the yoga studio.

01:20:29.855 --> 01:20:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we
talk about ego almost

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.105 align:middle line:84%
like it's the worst
thing in the world.

01:20:33.105 --> 01:20:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you have ego,
then you're a jerk.

01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Ego death is horrifying
when you see it happen.

01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Ego death, it feels
like real death.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And ayahuasca is called
"the vine of the spirit"

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:47.110 align:middle line:90%
or "the vine of death."

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it brings you into
a simulated near-death

01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:52.070 align:middle line:90%
experience, a lot of the time.

01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:54.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you don't
know if you're coming back.

01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:55.885 align:middle line:84%
Even though you know
that you're supposed to,

01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
even though you know
that everyone does,

01:20:57.630 --> 01:20:59.380 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca doesn't kill
anybody-- you know,

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.380 align:middle line:90%
there's been one or two.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But usually, there's some
other substance involved.

01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:05.320 align:middle line:90%
So talk about a safe substance.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Ayahuasca doesn't kill people.

01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Even though you
know that going in,

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:12.940 align:middle line:84%
it takes the part of
your psyche away from you

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that can give you
some self-soothe talk

01:21:15.550 --> 01:21:16.850 align:middle line:90%
during an experience.

01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have that during
a really intense ayahuasca

01:21:20.210 --> 01:21:21.010 align:middle line:90%
ceremony.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:24.130 align:middle line:84%
You don't have that ability
to know whether or not

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:26.440 align:middle line:90%
you're OK or safe.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Your ego's being dissolved.

01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's really unpleasant.

01:21:30.610 --> 01:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
But along with that ego
are a lot of patterns.

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I've had ayahuasca
ceremonies that

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:39.370 align:middle line:84%
have undone years and
years of patterning,

01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:41.237 align:middle line:84%
whether it's from
trauma in my childhood,

01:21:41.237 --> 01:21:43.570 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's patterning
just growing up in this world

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and being kind of like
a chauvinistic male.

01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:49.930 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my early 20s, and
waking up the next morning,

01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and being like, oh,
oh, I feel a lot-- wow,

01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.150 align:middle line:90%
that whole part of me is gone.

01:21:55.150 --> 01:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I feel a lot more connected
to this feminine energy

01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.710 align:middle line:84%
inside of me that I've
been trying to squash down

01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:00.550 align:middle line:90%
for my entire life.

01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Because, as a male, we're
not supposed to show that.

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So it does this amazing,
amazing healing work

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
on your orientation
towards yourself.

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, it shatters
you on the floor for a while.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you spend the
backhalf of the ceremony

01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
picking up the pieces that
actually mean something to you,

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.367 align:middle line:84%
and that are important, and
leaving the rest behind.

01:22:20.367 --> 01:22:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So I can't speak to how it
works on a scientific level.

01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:26.530 align:middle line:90%
There are very few who can.

01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But I know from an experiential
perspective why it works

01:22:31.330 --> 01:22:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and how the healing can be
so deep that it could leave

01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:36.160 align:middle line:84%
behind years and
years of an addiction

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.123 align:middle line:84%
to whatever, cigarettes,
heroin, alcohol,

01:22:39.123 --> 01:22:41.290 align:middle line:84%
or a certain type of behavior
towards a certain type

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:42.220 align:middle line:90%
of person.

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:43.840 align:middle line:90%
It can be gone overnight.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really
intense work.

01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's not pleasant.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
look at it like a party drug.

01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But you only need to
try it once to realize

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.672 align:middle line:84%
what you've got yourself
into, definitely on a party.

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> What's not party about it?

01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I hear people throw up.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Is it painful?

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it physically painful?

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.622 align:middle line:90%
Or is it emotionally painful?

01:23:04.622 --> 01:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> A really intense ayahuasca
ceremony is going to reveal all

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
the negative self talk that's
been a kind of running behind

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:17.570 align:middle line:84%
the scenes for the last
month, year of your life.

01:23:17.570 --> 01:23:19.340 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see
it, but not just see

01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
it like, oh, look at that, wow,
I probably shouldn't say that

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
to myself anymore, oh, man you
know I'm really not a phony,

01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
or, man, I'm really
not unworthy,

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.570 align:middle line:84%
or I'm really not some jerk
who thinks that he's somebody.

01:23:35.570 --> 01:23:38.150 align:middle line:84%
That's not how
you experience it.

01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:41.480 align:middle line:84%
You experience it by being
thrown into a Petri dish

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
with that one type of
thought for a while

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
how damaging it is

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and how uncomfortable it
can be in your entire being.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.405 align:middle line:84%
So you're experiencing
those thoughts.

01:23:52.405 --> 01:23:54.530 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to just passively
seeing them and trying

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.210 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of them,
you're actually

01:23:56.210 --> 01:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
thrown into these
different emotions,

01:23:58.070 --> 01:24:01.070 align:middle line:84%
these different feelings
of pain or discomfort

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:03.590 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with that
negative self-talk that's

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:05.130 align:middle line:90%
been running in the background.

01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So you could spend
a whole evening just

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:12.200 align:middle line:84%
suffering, going from one,
figuring it out, clearing it,

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.798 align:middle line:84%
having a moment of,
like, oh, my gosh,

01:24:13.798 --> 01:24:15.590 align:middle line:84%
thank God that's gone
now, but then getting

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:17.760 align:middle line:90%
thrown into the next one.

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
from my perspective.

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:23.157 align:middle line:84%
And it's also what I
know from hearing a bunch

01:24:23.157 --> 01:24:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of other people's stories.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.687 align:middle line:84%
But everyone has a different
experience with it.

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't have a
hard time with ayahuasca.

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you know, it'll be
a completely different plant.

01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So for me, ayahuasca
is kryptonite.

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:35.910 align:middle line:90%
I take it.

01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:37.260 align:middle line:90%
And it is going to be suffering.

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.302 align:middle line:84%
But it's, I'm going to to
come out the other end,

01:24:39.302 --> 01:24:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to feel
incredible afterward.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But when I ingest something
like San Pedro cactus,

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.870 align:middle line:90%
it's like a total ally.

01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I feel invincible, and
supported, and amazing on it.

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But I've experienced
many, many people cruise

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
through an ayahuasca ceremony,
but then go onto San Pedro,

01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:middle line:90%
and suffer immensely.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has their
own energía, right?

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Every plant has its own energy.

01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:10.717 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that energy
is exactly what you need.

01:25:10.717 --> 01:25:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And it will bring
out all the darkness

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.550 align:middle line:90%
so that you can heal yourself.

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's a
perfect match for you.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:18.093 align:middle line:84%
And you just kind
of ride with it.

01:25:18.093 --> 01:25:19.260 align:middle line:90%
You dance with it all night.

01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's enjoyable.

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And down in the jungle, in
Central and South America,

01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:27.480 align:middle line:84%
plants are looked at
as having genders too.

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So ayahuasca is definitely
a female energy.

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, females just
revel in that experience.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It's completely like going
home, this idea of surrender,

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.313 align:middle line:84%
which is what
ayahuasca does to us.

01:25:39.313 --> 01:25:40.480 align:middle line:90%
It brings you to your knees.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It makes you embrace
this female part of you,

01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:47.160 align:middle line:90%
this chaos energy that's in you.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.970 align:middle line:90%
And it forces you to--

01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:52.500 align:middle line:84%
as a male, I've seen mostly
men have a really hard time

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:53.580 align:middle line:90%
with ayahuasca.

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
This idea of surrendering
to this divine feminine that

01:25:56.070 --> 01:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
exists in everybody is really
hard for men a lot of the time.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And women, in those
ceremonies, I've

01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:05.140 align:middle line:84%
seen women doing
upside down yoga poses,

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:06.930 align:middle line:90%
and just giggling, and laughing.

01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:09.900 align:middle line:90%
And they are now in their power.

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Where you see men just curled
up in the fetal position,

01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:17.010 align:middle line:84%
throwing up out of every
single end, every single hole

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:18.450 align:middle line:90%
in their body.

01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the next
day, you know-- again,

01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:23.730 align:middle line:84%
the next day or two days
later, in a San Pedro ceremony

01:26:23.730 --> 01:26:25.420 align:middle line:84%
with the same group,
those women who

01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:27.080 align:middle line:84%
were having such a
good time are just

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.830 align:middle line:84%
writhing on the ground
in broad daylight--

01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
because San Pedro is done in
the middle of the day-- going

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.830 align:middle line:90%
through it.

01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Where the men are, like,
starting to understand.

01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they have this
deeper, grandfather energy.

01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:41.280 align:middle line:84%
They have this
understanding of the world.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And they're able
to move with more--

01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, with more rhythm,
with more pace, and deeper

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:49.820 align:middle line:90%
connection.

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's really interesting
to watch, you know,

01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:54.810 align:middle line:84%
what each plant medicine
brings out in each person.

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:56.935 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's the
same for any one person.

01:26:56.935 --> 01:26:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think everybody should
be trying this out at one stage

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:00.300 align:middle line:90%
in their life?

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's like
a quarterly affair?

01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:05.062 align:middle line:90%
Or is it an annual thing?

01:27:05.062 --> 01:27:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something
that people just

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
go to in the dark
days of the soul

01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:11.110 align:middle line:84%
when they've got something to
heal and they really need it?

01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something you
have to feel called to do?

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:14.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in your
experience, how do

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:17.082 align:middle line:84%
you feel this has any sort
of reasonable practical

01:27:17.082 --> 01:27:18.540 align:middle line:84%
application in the
developed world?

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:21.877 align:middle line:84%
>> I think everyone in the
world should be using herbs.

01:27:21.877 --> 01:27:23.710 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think that
everyone in the world

01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:26.215 align:middle line:84%
should be using
psychoactive plants.

01:27:26.215 --> 01:27:28.770 align:middle line:90%


01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's up to
us, knowing ourselves,

01:27:31.050 --> 01:27:32.745 align:middle line:90%
knowing what we're ready for.

01:27:32.745 --> 01:27:33.870 align:middle line:90%
It's an individual journey.

01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:36.422 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the idea
of personal empowerment.

01:27:36.422 --> 01:27:38.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not what your doctor
tells you what to do.

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:40.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not what the
shaman asks you to do.

01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not what your friends
think is a good idea.

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:45.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's what you
think you're ready for.

01:27:45.450 --> 01:27:47.190 align:middle line:90%
Everyone should be using herbs.

01:27:47.190 --> 01:27:49.635 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're all
using herbs anyway.

01:27:49.635 --> 01:27:51.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're eating a salad,
you're using herbs.

01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's
about us going deeper

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:57.630 align:middle line:84%
with our understanding
of herbs and learning

01:27:57.630 --> 01:28:00.390 align:middle line:90%
which herbs are our allies.

01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has an herbal ally.

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Mine happens to be reishi,
ashwagandha, and skullcap.

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:10.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think when people
find their perfect herb,

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.840 align:middle line:90%
it's extremely empowering.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.340 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that people should

01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:16.680 align:middle line:84%
be going down to the jungle
to work with ayahuasca just

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.480 align:middle line:90%
because.

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think people
should be taking

01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:21.930 align:middle line:84%
a heroic dose of
psilocybin mushrooms

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:25.980 align:middle line:84%
just because Michael
Pollan did it in his book.

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's about being
cautious, making distinctions,

01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:30.360 align:middle line:90%
moving slowly.

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
We live in a culture
of convenience,

01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:34.640 align:middle line:90%
a culture of the quick fix.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.050 align:middle line:90%
We want results now.

01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:37.820 align:middle line:90%
We want a good time now.

01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.010 align:middle line:90%
We want to feel better now.

01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And if there's anything
that the traditional healing

01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:47.580 align:middle line:84%
path has taught me, is
that it's not about that.

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:51.590 align:middle line:84%
It's about improvement every
single day, one step at a time,

01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:55.310 align:middle line:84%
learning how to enjoy the
process, make distinctions.

01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:59.954 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you'll be
better before you know it.

01:28:59.954 --> 01:29:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a perfect end.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.100 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
that I've missed

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:06.010 align:middle line:90%
that you want to talk about?

01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So a number of schools in
the United States are reducing

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:11.770 align:middle line:90%
recess to 15 minutes.

01:29:11.770 --> 01:29:14.125 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are even
getting rid of recess.

01:29:14.125 --> 01:29:18.415 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we're seeing
skyrocketing rates of ADHD.

01:29:18.415 --> 01:29:21.170 align:middle line:90%


01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:24.470 align:middle line:90%
My prescription, with my kids--

01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:25.740 align:middle line:90%
who are off the wall too.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think kids are
off the wall to begin with--

01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:32.340 align:middle line:84%
is to get them outside
and to limit device time.

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Our friends come
over to our house.

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And they see we have
one little television.

01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:39.047 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
devices besides that.

01:29:39.047 --> 01:29:40.380 align:middle line:90%
And that television is never on.

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.990 align:middle line:90%
They're like, how do you do it?

01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:middle line:90%
What do you kids do?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, it's crazy.

01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Actually, get ready for this.

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.220 align:middle line:90%
They go outside.

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:54.230 align:middle line:90%
And they play all day.

01:29:54.230 --> 01:29:58.050 align:middle line:84%
We got rid of that in
this culture somehow.

01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:00.940 align:middle line:90%
It became obsolete.

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:02.590 align:middle line:90%
But is it really serving us?

01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally agree.

01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:05.190 align:middle line:90%
We're putting shoes on our kids.

01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:06.160 align:middle line:90%
We're locking them up.

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're making
them learn things

01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:10.100 align:middle line:90%
that they don't really need.

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And if they try to portray
any artistic flair or anything

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.250 align:middle line:84%
outside the norm of our sort of
Victorian-era, industrialized

01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:21.590 align:middle line:84%
education system, we're
like, no, get back into line!

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:23.362 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit of a mess, really.

01:30:23.362 --> 01:30:25.307 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know
what it's tied into.

01:30:25.307 --> 01:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think
that there's probably

01:30:26.890 --> 01:30:29.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot more-- there's darker
origins than we probably

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:31.240 align:middle line:90%
care to even look at.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:34.510 align:middle line:84%
This association with being
outside, being barefoot,

01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:41.970 align:middle line:84%
working with your hands as
being somehow uncivilized,

01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:47.100 align:middle line:84%
unhuman, lower, like, what does
that really say about the way

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:50.307 align:middle line:84%
that we view the
rest of the world?

01:30:50.307 --> 01:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
If your kid can't play
outside, or playing outside

01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
is somehow barbaric,
and you'd rather

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:58.990 align:middle line:84%
have them plugged
into a device playing

01:30:58.990 --> 01:31:03.450 align:middle line:84%
some kind of shoot-em-up
video game inside, that

01:31:03.450 --> 01:31:06.130 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make any sense.

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there is
this overall disconnection

01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:10.490 align:middle line:84%
from nature that's at the
heart of a lot of what

01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:11.820 align:middle line:90%
we're going through right now.

01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:13.020 align:middle line:84%
If we were more
connected to nature,

01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:14.850 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't do a lot
of what we're doing.

01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:17.940 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be creating the
waste that we're creating.

01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't be supporting
the brands that we support.

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we'd be
mortified at the fact

01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:26.778 align:middle line:84%
that they were
deforested this planet.

01:31:26.778 --> 01:31:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I think that if we were
outside, barefoot--

01:31:28.570 --> 01:31:31.310 align:middle line:84%
and as we've seen with grounding
technologies, what you see

01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:34.220 align:middle line:84%
happens to your blood, what you
see happens to your brain, when

01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:36.200 align:middle line:84%
you're just putting
your feet on the soil,

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.070 align:middle line:84%
or putting your feet
into pristine water,

01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:42.680 align:middle line:84%
walking in the ocean, it
does things to you chemically

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.120 align:middle line:90%
that can't be denied.

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, we're denying
it to our own children.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.320 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a little wacky right now.

01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We probably wouldn't be
shooting people at the rate

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:54.760 align:middle line:84%
we're shooting people
in this country, right?

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:55.802 align:middle line:90%
>> We're in Colorado.

01:31:55.802 --> 01:31:57.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a little sensitive here.

01:31:57.010 --> 01:32:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where
Columbine happened.

01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:02.315 align:middle line:84%
Just last week, our
schools all got shut down

01:32:02.315 --> 01:32:03.940 align:middle line:84%
because there was
another threat in one

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:05.890 align:middle line:90%
of the elementary schools.

01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And in one sense,
we're wondering,

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.410 align:middle line:90%
how is this happening?

01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:13.510 align:middle line:84%
On the other side,
we have our kids

01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:17.140 align:middle line:84%
playing the most violent games
they could possibly play.

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:20.313 align:middle line:84%
And we're also celebrating
violence in our news media.

01:32:20.313 --> 01:32:21.730 align:middle line:84%
If you read "The
New York Times"--

01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:25.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this isn't news anymore.

01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:28.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you read any
major periodical,

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:32.620 align:middle line:84%
any major publication, the
headlines that you're seeing

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:36.140 align:middle line:90%
are all about violence and sex.

01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're championing it.

01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.670 align:middle line:84%
We're championing
violence and sex.

01:32:39.670 --> 01:32:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're taking away the
outlet that our children have

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:46.870 align:middle line:84%
to sort of get rid of
a lot of this energy,

01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and be themselves, and
explore a natural environment,

01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and let their brains open up
to what's out there as opposed

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to being inside and
being programmed

01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:59.437 align:middle line:84%
by all this negativity that
we see around us all the time.

01:32:59.437 --> 01:33:00.520 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Being under the sun,
being in the dirt,

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.910 align:middle line:84%
God forbid you
actually get a scratch,

01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:10.210 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, get some poison
ivy, or something like that,

01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:11.335 align:middle line:90%
and go through that lesson.

01:33:11.335 --> 01:33:13.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're not getting
any of those lessons anymore.

01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
We're just inside while
our parents are trying

01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:17.020 align:middle line:90%
to keep up with the Joneses.

01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're wondering why
this society is so sick.

01:33:21.850 --> 01:33:24.864 align:middle line:90%
It's just time for a change.

01:33:24.864 --> 01:33:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Dad mode, I love it.

01:33:29.250 --> 01:33:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:31.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you, man.

01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:33.165 align:middle line:84%
It's that realization
when you're

01:33:33.165 --> 01:33:35.890 align:middle line:84%
like-- when you're a filmmaker,
when you're a researcher, when

01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:37.390 align:middle line:84%
you've done
documentaries, you know,

01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:39.640 align:middle line:84%
you do a fair bit of work
researching what's going on,

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.662 align:middle line:84%
who's created this
system, is it real.

01:33:41.662 --> 01:33:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And then you have kids.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And you're like,
oh, my goodness,

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:45.478 align:middle line:84%
far out, there's been
this whole system created

01:33:45.478 --> 01:33:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to domesticate us,
either by design,

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:53.630 align:middle line:84%
or by mistake, that has created
a modern, domesticated human

01:33:53.630 --> 01:33:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that is disconnected from its
source, disconnected from where

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:01.220 align:middle line:90%
it came, and where it will go.

01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, we've created
a sort of mass neurosis.

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And we've become anxious,
depressed, unwell.

01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And we then go solve it
with some pharmaceutical

01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:16.630 align:middle line:84%
or some artificial, as opposed
to, like, get in the water,

01:34:16.630 --> 01:34:20.160 align:middle line:84%
go for a swim, run
outdoors, pick some herbs

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.570 align:middle line:90%
growing on your back door step.

01:34:21.570 --> 01:34:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>> We were talking about
Jared Diamond before.

01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:26.900 align:middle line:84%
He's had this-- so I'm listening
to "Germs, Guns, and Steel"

01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:27.900 align:middle line:90%
right now on audiobooks.

01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:28.710 align:middle line:90%
It's just blowing my mind.

01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:30.293 align:middle line:84%
My buddy has a farm
down the roadside.

01:34:30.293 --> 01:34:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So I help him out once a
week for a couple hours.

01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And I listen to "Germs,
Guns, and Steel" on there.

01:34:35.370 --> 01:34:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It's such a good thing
to do at the same time.

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:41.010 align:middle line:90%
But I'm at the end now.

01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:42.570 align:middle line:84%
But he's making
a big distinction

01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:47.690 align:middle line:90%
between domesticated and tamed.

01:34:47.690 --> 01:34:49.290 align:middle line:90%
They're different.

01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain animals
that can be domesticated.

01:34:52.190 --> 01:34:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
animals that can't.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well,
how is it that Hannibal

01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.330 align:middle line:90%
used these elephants?

01:34:58.330 --> 01:35:00.030 align:middle line:84%
These elephants
aren't domesticatable.

01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, well,
they're tamable.

01:35:02.250 --> 01:35:05.830 align:middle line:84%
They're able to behave
this way if they want to.

01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But part of them will
never be truly domestic.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And as part of
the qualifications

01:35:13.330 --> 01:35:15.430 align:middle line:84%
for domesticatable,
the brain size

01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
can fluctuate based on
interaction with man.

01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So our domesticated animals,
their ancestors in the wild

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.510 align:middle line:90%
had much bigger brains.

01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:27.550 align:middle line:90%
They had much more potential.

01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:33.280 align:middle line:84%
They were much more in
touch with their senses.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And once you become
domesticated, that goes away.

01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So for me, reading
that, I'm like,

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:40.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be domestic.

01:35:40.090 --> 01:35:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I want to be tamed.

01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm fine with being tamed, but
having the potential to be wild

01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:47.110 align:middle line:90%
whenever I want to.

01:35:47.110 --> 01:35:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we live in
a very domesticated society.

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing that on every
level disease, intelligence,

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%
emotional intelligence,
and ability to survive.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that we have
much longer for this planet

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:04.420 align:middle line:84%
if we're continuing
down the same path.

01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:07.735 align:middle line:84%
We need to become
a little more wild.

01:36:07.735 --> 01:36:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Something that I want
to say real quickly.

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.610 align:middle line:90%


01:36:12.610 --> 01:36:14.270 align:middle line:84%
When my wife, Michelle,
became pregnant

01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:17.675 align:middle line:84%
with our first son, River,
I was down in the jungle.

01:36:17.675 --> 01:36:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking to one
of the shamans down there.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I told him, I'm
like, I'm going to have a baby.

01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:27.310 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, are you ready?

01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:29.320 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I don't know.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:32.530 align:middle line:84%
He's like, Nick, you know
how we talk about ayahuasca

01:36:32.530 --> 01:36:34.850 align:middle line:90%
as being pretty powerful.

01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:38.480 align:middle line:84%
The most powerful medicine on
this planet that I know of,

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and I've tried just
about every medicine

01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that this jungle has to offer--
the most powerful medicine

01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:46.640 align:middle line:90%
on the planet is parenthood.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's cool.

01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:50.430 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:52.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a nice story.

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:56.580 align:middle line:84%
My son was born, like,
six, seven months later.

01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:58.140 align:middle line:90%
It was like a cosmic bitch slap.

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:01.230 align:middle line:90%


01:37:01.230 --> 01:37:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Immediate lessons,
things that I had never

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.760 align:middle line:84%
been able to loosen up with
any kind of plant medicine,

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:09.630 align:middle line:84%
therapy, spiritual
practice, whatever,

01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:13.590 align:middle line:84%
were brought out into the
open when I became a dad.

01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was a lesson
in self forgiveness.

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I was not as good as
I thought I was going to be.

01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was going
to be the best ever.

01:37:20.610 --> 01:37:22.027 align:middle line:84%
And then he's,
like, one-year-old.

01:37:22.027 --> 01:37:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I just kind of
got upset and yelled something.

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.517 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, my god, I'm
the worst dad on the planet.

01:37:28.517 --> 01:37:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I just got
upset and lost my cool.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:33.240 align:middle line:90%
This was so not OK.

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And there was a part of
me, from the inside me,

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.050 align:middle line:84%
that's like, wow, look at you,
look at you losing your shit.

01:37:41.050 --> 01:37:42.880 align:middle line:84%
You thought you
had it figured out.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.922 align:middle line:84%
You thought you had this
whole thing figured out.

01:37:44.922 --> 01:37:46.600 align:middle line:90%
That's really cute.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.045 align:middle line:90%
Children are medicine.

01:37:49.045 --> 01:37:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Bitter.

01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Bitter medicine.

01:37:53.670 --> 01:37:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It's tough work, man.

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.120 align:middle line:90%
I totally get it.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself saying
things that I shouldn't say.

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And the journey of being
a conscious parent,

01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and also going through your
own journey of becoming

01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:08.450 align:middle line:84%
as undomesticated, and as
wild, and as free as possible,

01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:12.560 align:middle line:84%
so that you can maintain your
nubility and your intelligence,

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.750 align:middle line:90%
is a big journey.

01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And kudos to you
for doing your best.

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:19.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Likewise.

01:38:19.421 --> 01:38:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm really happy
with the chat.

01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Nick.

01:38:22.670 --> 01:38:25.340 align:middle line:90%
We took it many places.

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:27.520 align:middle line:90%
We went to the jungle.

01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.110 align:middle line:90%
We went to parenthood.

01:38:30.110 --> 01:38:32.175 align:middle line:84%
And we spoke about
the domestication

01:38:32.175 --> 01:38:33.050 align:middle line:90%
of the human species.

01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:35.540 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for your insight.

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And looking forward to
seeing what else you

01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:38.990 align:middle line:90%
discover on your journey.

01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Because what you've
brought to the world

01:38:41.150 --> 01:38:43.790 align:middle line:84%
has been such a gift
already through your work.

01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:45.365 align:middle line:90%
Excited for what's next.

01:38:45.365 --> 01:38:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Honored to be
part of this project.
