00:00:07.383 --> 00:00:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES COLQUHOUN: Hi.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.800 align:middle line:84%
It's James here
from "Food Matters,"

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm here today
with Sir Ken Robinson.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Ken is a researcher,
and academic.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.370 align:middle line:84%
He is an author of
"Creative Schools."

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And he is a force for good
in championing the notion

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that the non-academic components
of our education system

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.960 align:middle line:84%
should be considered
with deep reverence

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.647 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how they can help
culture, a new form of children

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:84%
and humanity out in the
world solving the biggest

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:90%
problems of today.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Sir Ken, how are you?

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KEN: I'm great.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES: Nice.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I'd
like to start, really,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning, really, the
founding time and the founding

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.750 align:middle line:90%
era of education.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
It was really sort of
in this industrial era

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
where we moved from
an idea and notion

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that we'd be raised by our
parents in a community.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.782 align:middle line:84%
And we'd be taught what to
do, whether as a blacksmith,

00:00:54.782 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:84%
or this, and follow our
parents' footsteps to going

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:90%
into an education system.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell me
what was happening

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:84%
at that time of our history
and how schools were created,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:90%
that founding intention?

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN: Well, there have
always been schools.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
People have always been able
to get themselves educated,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.280 align:middle line:84%
providing they could
pay for it, or they

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.413 align:middle line:84%
were pursuing a
particular path in the UK,

00:01:19.413 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:90%
for example, where I'm from.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But it was true
of most of Europe.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.360 align:middle line:84%
There were always opportunities
to become educated if you

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:90%
wanted to enter the church.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even
for a long time--

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:90%
there were church schools.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.592 align:middle line:84%
There were opportunities
to be educated privately,

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and the nobility always
provided for themselves

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.120 align:middle line:90%
in that point of view.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So education is not
new by any means.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.940 align:middle line:84%
It traces its way back
in one form or another

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.863 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning
of civilization.

00:01:45.863 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:84%
What we're really talking
about are the growth

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
of systems of mass
public education,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and they really
have their origins

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
in most countries in
the mid-19th century.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Some earlier than
that, but really,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.850 align:middle line:84%
mass public education got off
the ground in the 19th century.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And by mass public education,
I mean systems of education

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that were initiated by
central governments which

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
were available free at the point
of delivery, in most cases.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And energy costs were compulsory
for certain age groups.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, historically,
they're relatively recent.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was born in 1950.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:90%
My dad was born in 1914.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:84%
When he was at
school, he left at 14,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
so compulsory education
covered quite a narrow range

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
until it got to, in the UK, to
take that as an example, 1944,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
when there was an
education act which

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
provided for
everyone to continue

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:90%
in various sorts of schools.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they started to
raise the school-leaving age.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
That became a
controversial issue.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.005 align:middle line:84%
But when I was at
school, people mainly

00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
left the 15, unless you stayed
on to do some higher work

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.020 align:middle line:90%
and you stayed until 18.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's relatively recent.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And these systems, in my view--
and I've written quite a bit

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:90%
about it--

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:84%
grew up in the interests of
the Industrial Revolution.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And to some degree,
in the image of it.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
They grew up because
of a need, in part,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:84%
to create a mass workforce for
this huge industrial complex

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:90%
that was evolving.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.282 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to overestimate
the impact of industrialism.

00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it has its
roots in the 18th century

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and a little earlier as a
force of economic change.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But it led to a massive
shift in the way people

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:90%
lived and worked.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:84%
The great majority of people
in Europe and in the Americas

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:90%
lived and worked in the fields.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
But with industrialism,
they started

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
to migrate into the cities
to work in the factories,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and to dig the roads,
and build the railways,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.342 align:middle line:84%
and create this massive
infrastructure that

00:03:54.342 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:90%
was required.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And that needed a new
sort of workforce.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It needed people who were
literate to a certain degree,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
who were numerate
to a certain degree.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But it really was divided
into several groups.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of people
during the industrial period

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
were required to do manual
work, to tend the machines,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to wield the shovels, the
picks, and wield the hammers.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
And a smaller group
were needed to do

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
all the administrative work
to keep that system running.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of Britain
and the other colonial powers,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.042 align:middle line:84%
there was the need for people to
go and administer the colonies

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and to be educated with a
slightly different level as

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.203 align:middle line:84%
So what you had evolving
over that period

00:04:34.203 --> 00:04:35.120 align:middle line:90%
was a kind of pyramid.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There was a broad
base of people who

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:84%
were being educated to a
certain level of basic numeracy

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:90%
and literacy.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:84%
There was a group
slightly higher

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
than that who would be going
on to administrative work

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and certain
managerial-type jobs.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And then a group
would be educated

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
to take on these sort of
higher leadership roles.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And the system was composed
in that image, a broad base

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.850 align:middle line:84%
of elementary education,
a slightly narrow band

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
of high school, middle
school and high school,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and then quite a narrow
band of people who wanted

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:90%
went on to university.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.512 align:middle line:84%
Because the rough equation
was that about 80% of people

00:05:09.512 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
were going to be selling their
physical labor and maybe 20%

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:84%
would be selling their
intellectual labor,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.910 align:middle line:90%
and it was built that way.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So when I was going to school
in the 1950s, about one

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
in 20 people, I think,
went to university.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority people
left school at 15,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and a smaller group went on
to do higher exams with a view

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to go into some kind of
university or higher-education

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So there was an
economic impulse.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
is that the system

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
was organized a bit on the
principles of mass production.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So people were selected
for certain routes.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.370 align:middle line:84%
The kids went through
the system by age group.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.620 align:middle line:84%
This was a massive invention
to put this system into place.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But children went in at a
certain age, four or five.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.530 align:middle line:90%
They went through by age groups.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.988 align:middle line:90%
They still do.

00:05:56.988 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
points of selection

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:84%
where some kids go that
way, some kids go that way.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.162 align:middle line:84%
In the British system, which
wasn't untypical for Europe,

00:06:05.162 --> 00:06:07.620 align:middle line:84%
people were selected according
to whether they were thought

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:90%
to be more fit for manual work.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they might
have the spark they

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:84%
thought was needed for academic
work or a particular interest

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:90%
in that.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
In the UK case, we were
selected at the age of 11

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
to do that on the
basis of an IQ test

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:90%
of which we could say more.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
But you were divided
into sheeps and goats.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And then a few people went onto
university as a consequence.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So the organizational
principle was

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:84%
very similar to mass
production systems.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It was based on standardization,
conformity selection.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was also geared to
selecting a particular type

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
of commodity with a particular
sort of product at the far end.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And like any system of
mass industrial production,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
it was predicated on generating
a fair amount of waste

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
materials, because not
every not everybody

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:84%
was suited to the task that
they were being groomed for.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And so they went to one side.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was at
that point we invented

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.770 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea of
educational disability,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.665 align:middle line:84%
again, of which
you could say more.

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
interesting schism here.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that the organizational
principles were well modeled

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:90%
on industrial production.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.842 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying consciously,
but it was in the culture

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:90%
that people thought that way.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do you mobilize
vast numbers of people

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:90%
through a system?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:84%
You standardize, select, make
it about conformity and so on.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
But the intellectual
culture of education

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.200 align:middle line:84%
wasn't based on
factory production.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It was based on the interests
of the universities.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And the universities
were interested in people

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:90%
who were good at academic work.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was assumed that
in order to succeed

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.405 align:middle line:84%
in professional jobs, you needed
good academic qualifications.

00:07:49.405 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
intrigued by that.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Because in ordinary life,
to describe something

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
as purely academic is to dismiss
it as theoretical and not

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:90%
practical.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Academics are meant to
live in ivory towers

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and not know how the
real world works.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.457 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
true, by the way.

00:08:03.457 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:90%
But that's part of mythology.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.052 align:middle line:90%
So along the way--

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and there are deeper
roots to this culturally--

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
but along the way,
education also became

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.770 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with academic
work, academic ability,

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and a kind of caste
system evolved

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.155 align:middle line:84%
which distinguished
between people

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:84%
who are good at
academic work and those

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.197 align:middle line:84%
who are more
practically oriented,

00:08:23.197 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
between academic and
vocational courses.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And so people who went
on to work in the trades

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:84%
or to do manual work were
just implicitly considered

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:84%
to be not smartest of people
who went to university,

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
and that persists
still, I think,

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:90%
in our view of the world.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But there are really
two types of kid,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:90%
academic and non-academic.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Or as we've come to think
of them, or as a commonly

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
caricature, the able
and the less able.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And so these cultural
roots and economic roots

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:84%
are really very deep-seated
in our current systems

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.720 align:middle line:90%
of education.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.512 align:middle line:84%
And they're simply not
fit for purpose now,

00:08:55.512 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
which is why I think it's
not enough to improve them.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.095 align:middle line:90%
We have to replace them.

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES: I couldn't
tend to agree more.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's
easy to see that that

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:90%
was a good idea at the time.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:90%
It made sense.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It Was very fitting for that
particular period of time.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet as we've
progressed, we seem

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:84%
to have stuck with this
idea, even though we

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:90%
can see that it's not working.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the points
that you touched on

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is this idea that
it just doesn't work

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:90%
for certain types of people.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.677 align:middle line:90%
You called it an educational--

00:09:26.677 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KEN: Caste system.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES: Caste system.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.937 align:middle line:84%
And then certain people
that doesn't work for.

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And we then classify them as
having a particular condition.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
They are unable to
learn, they have ADHD,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.855 align:middle line:84%
or they have
something like this.

00:09:35.855 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And is that not this
the symptom that's

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.190 align:middle line:84%
sort of telling of
this particular system?

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN: Well, it is
obviously more complicated

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
in practice than the
quick sketch I've given.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything is when it
comes to it in human systems.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.898 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example, many
people benefited enormously

00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:84%
from the opportunities
that were presented.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:84%
It was an absolute
paradigm shift

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
our social systems

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
that so many people were put
through education systems

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.025 align:middle line:84%
with a view to developing
their basic skills in literacy

00:10:11.025 --> 00:10:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and numeracy and
giving opportunities

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:84%
to others to develop other
sorts of intellectual capacity

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as I say, it
was unprecedented for

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.830 align:middle line:84%
to happen on this scale, like
the Industrial Revolution

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.622 align:middle line:90%
itself was unprecedented.

00:10:25.622 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And some people really
benefited from it.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm one of them.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.110 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt about that.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.152 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I grew up in a
large working-class family

00:10:31.152 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:90%
in Liverpool.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't be sitting here
talking to you now had it not

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
been for the system of
mass public education.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not critical
of its intentions.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not critical of the benefits
it bestowed on lots of people.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm very sensitive the
idea that some people like

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:84%
me did very well,
and then they get

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
accused of trying to pull up
the ladder after themselves.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.810 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
really how it worked.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the system
was always designed

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:90%
to benefit some people.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And I, like others, had
a kind of interest in it.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.473 align:middle line:90%
It suited me, in a way.

00:11:03.473 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But it would have
been like having

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:84%
a system of education that
was based entirely on the need

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.530 align:middle line:90%
to produce more carpenters.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And it would benefit the people
who were good at carpentry

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and want to become
carpenters, and it would have

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:90%
disadvantaged everyone else.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.290 align:middle line:84%
They would have been considered
to be less able if they were

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
got electricity or if they
were good at writing essays,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.960 align:middle line:84%
they would have been put
in some remedial group.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
If you take a narrow
conception of human competence

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and then use it as a measure
of everybody, of course

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
some people will
benefit from it.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.783 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't just the
activities we're given.

00:11:36.783 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the opportunities
that education creates.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons that
education is so important

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
is because it helps people to
expand their consciousness,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.680 align:middle line:84%
expand their minds, to
be able to understand

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
things they previously wouldn't
have had access to at all.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not critical
of the intention.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was designed, I think,
with the best purpose in mind,

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:90%
in many cases.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.665 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any political
system is also

00:11:58.665 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:90%
shot through with cynicism.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But it worked in some
ways for some people.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
It was also a catastrophe
for a lot of other people.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:90%
I know this to be true.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I know, again, if I take
my own experience of it

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that in the UK for
a period of time,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
the selection after
elementary school

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
was to go to grammar schools
or secondary market schools.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Most public systems
have something like that

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:90%
or have had something like that.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And the decision to send
you one way or the other

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.810 align:middle line:84%
was based on your
performance in this test,

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
in our case, 11-plus,
which was an IQ test.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.412 align:middle line:84%
Well, IQ is a very
troubled idea.

00:12:40.412 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, I
think, came to believe

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
that IQ was like a
blood test, that you

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:90%
answered these questions.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you scored above a
certain level, you were smart.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't,
then you weren't.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is
that intelligence

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:84%
is much more complicated
than the ability

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
to answer several pages of
questions at 11:00 o'clock

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:90%
in the morning at the age of 11.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
who failed the test

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
could easily have
passed it if they'd

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.967 align:middle line:84%
been given different support,
they'd been coached definitely,

00:13:12.967 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:84%
they'd had a different
attitude to it.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit like a driving test.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.918 align:middle line:84%
If you put random
people in the car

00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and say, drive this
down the freeway,

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.840 align:middle line:84%
some people are going to
crash, and some people

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.190 align:middle line:90%
figure it out quite quickly.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But almost everybody
could get the hang of it

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.180 align:middle line:84%
if you showed them
what was involved.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.060 align:middle line:84%
I passed 11-plus because of
a whole set of circumstances

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.830 align:middle line:90%
that were peculiar to me.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And I had some great
teachers, some great coaches,

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and I had an
advantage in doing it.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.680 align:middle line:90%
But I don't regret.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle line:84%
It opened up an entire
world of opportunity for me.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But the intentions
may be an honorable,

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
but it also meant that a lot
of people were discarded.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I know all kinds of people who
are tremendously able, smart,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.255 align:middle line:84%
competent, brilliant in
some cases, who did not pass

00:13:54.255 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
that test at the age of 11.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.012 align:middle line:84%
They still carry
with them the sense

00:13:57.012 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:84%
that they're just not as
smart as they're making out,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:90%
that it's all a big fraud.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I mean the university
chancellors and heads

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.543 align:middle line:84%
of companies that met along
the way who will sort of say

00:14:06.543 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:84%
in a slightly shamefaced
way, but of course, I

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
failed 11-plus, but
I succeeded anyway.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's as if they've been
stamped at this very early age.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.440 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's important to
keep that perspective in mind,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:84%
that this was not an
absolute test of ability.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a
culturally-oriented test.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Similar tests, by
the way used to be

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
applied to people arriving
in America at Ellis island.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And people were
assigned in times of war

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
to certain countries
in the military based

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
on their performance
in an IQ test.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.633 align:middle line:84%
And the ability, of course,
to complete IQ tests

00:14:40.633 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:84%
is often dependent
on cultural knowledge

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and linguistic skills,
which people didn't have.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So you might get
very able people

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:84%
come in who failed the test,
because they literally couldn't

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:90%
understand what was going on.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think the whole history
of IQ is very troubled.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Our conception of
intelligence in the West

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:84%
is very narrow,
for the most part.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It's confined still
to a particular form

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.220 align:middle line:90%
of academic work.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the work I've
been doing for long time

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
is based on the need to have
a richer conception of how

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
intelligence works,
what it is, how

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:90%
varied it is among individuals.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:84%
How varied it is
within individuals,

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:84%
how our capacities
are multifarious,

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and they're as rich and diverse
as native culture itself.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really very
important, because education

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
is one of the ways that we
give our children access

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:84%
to themselves, and help
them to become who they are,

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:90%
and who they can be.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And it comes at a very
crucial point in our lives.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we're playing
for very high stakes here.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.858 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES: I would agree.

00:15:37.858 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the stakes are high,

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and I think that when you said
that the children are very

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.542 align:middle line:84%
easily conditioned at
that particular age,

00:15:46.542 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
we know that from
a lot of studies,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the
subconscious conditioning

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
happens in children up to
the age of six or seven.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of download
a lot of their environment.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know people
that are fully grown

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:84%
who are successful in
many ways but still bad--

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and then there's people that
are less successful, culturally

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:84%
speaking, and they still
battle these ideas.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, little Johnny was
told he wasn't ever going

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
to amount to anything, because
he wasn't good at math.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.530 align:middle line:90%
So he wasn't good at this.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And these sort of messages from,
sometimes teachers, sometimes

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
from a schooling environment,
people carry it with them.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that
maybe I'm not good enough.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I don't fit in.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:84%
There is quite a bit of
this lack of self-worth

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.763 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be going around
with people who hit midlife,

00:16:28.763 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing a job
that they don't really love.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And they find out, well, I've
been not really supported

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.180 align:middle line:84%
that much, maybe,
in their upbringing.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KEN: Yes.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and I don't lay all
the problems of humanity

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:90%
at the door of public education.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:90%
On the contrary.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think it's been a
great force for liberation

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.765 align:middle line:90%
and a great force for good.

00:16:48.765 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
some people will

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
give in to feelings
of inadequacy

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and a lack of
self-worth no matter

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%
what the circumstance is.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
They could be growing up in
the most privileged environment

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
possible with the greatest
support from their parents.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of boomer
millennial parents

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
have discovered
this, that you lavish

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.565 align:middle line:84%
every opportunity on your
children, you encourage them.

00:17:12.565 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Particularly, it's been true
in the last number of years,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.099 align:middle line:84%
I think, where children are
being extolled and praised

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
for every single thing
like opening the door

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and walking through it and
being able to drink from a cup.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And there isn't a straight line
between affirmation and praise

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.770 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of self-worth.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, very often I think
it downgrades the currency.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And people, kids discover
things come too easy for them,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and the bar shifts.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's never straightforward.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.558 align:middle line:84%
It's like recommending
one sort of food that

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
will solve your health
problems, and it turns out

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:90%
it's not like that.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It's about how it all
fits into the overall diet

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and balance of your life.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.853 align:middle line:84%
And so it wouldn't
be right to say--

00:17:51.853 --> 00:17:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm certainly
not saying--

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.980 align:middle line:84%
that all the
feelings that people

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:84%
have of inadequacy
and self-doubt

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:84%
are because of how
they've been educated.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, in some
cases, it certainly is.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And what's also certainly
true is that education

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.160 align:middle line:90%
can be part of the problem.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, a big part of it.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.697 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important to
recognize that education won't

00:18:16.697 --> 00:18:18.780 align:middle line:84%
solve all social problems,
but it's very important

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:84%
that it's part of
the solution to them,

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and that it doesn't
pile on difficulties.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do know
from firsthand people

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:84%
who were devastated by their
education and others who've

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.600 align:middle line:90%
been liberated by it.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.538 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
the reasons why I

00:18:31.538 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
think it's very important
that we move away

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
from some idea of
standardization and conformity

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that individual
achievement, individual values,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.300 align:middle line:84%
individual potential lives are
as various as the people were

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Education has to
become individualized.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you
standardize it, you're

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.360 align:middle line:84%
bound to create a catastrophe
for some people that

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
would be avoidable if you
saw them as individuals.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.922 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES: Mm.

00:18:57.922 --> 00:18:58.722 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We've recently adopted
a boy into our family.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.887 align:middle line:90%
He's older.

00:19:05.887 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting story.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.428 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into it
here, obviously.

00:19:08.428 --> 00:19:12.512 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to school, and
his schooling was very basic

00:19:12.512 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:90%
when he was growing up.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.137 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, he
wouldn't go to school.

00:19:15.137 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:90%
It was just his environment.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And now, he's fitting into
his new school environment,

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and he's having to sort
of up-level a little bit

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:90%
from an academic perspective.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But socially, he's
very skillful.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.078 align:middle line:84%
In the sports field,
he's very skillful,

00:19:28.078 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's interesting that
he's being acknowledged

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:84%
for those things as well in
this school, which is fantastic.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
There is an epic story I believe
you told of this one lady who

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
thankfully had somebody help
to identify that she was

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:84%
a dancer and not somebody
that was to be sort of forced

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.923 align:middle line:90%
down this particular pathway.

00:19:45.923 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And she went on to do great
things with Andrew Lloyd

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Webber, et cetera.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KEN: Yeah.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember telling this
at the TED Talk I gave.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful woman
who died recently, sadly,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.790 align:middle line:90%
but at a great age.

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.330 align:middle line:90%
She was in her mid-90s.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:90%
But her name was Gillian Lynne.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I got to know
her fairly well when

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I was working with the Royal
Ballet a long time ago.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
But Gillian, when she was a
young kid in elementary school,

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:90%
was in constant trouble.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
It turned out because
she didn't pay attention.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.863 align:middle line:84%
She fidgeted a great
deal and tended

00:20:22.863 --> 00:20:24.030 align:middle line:90%
to get up and wander around.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.318 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the school
contacted her mother

00:20:28.318 --> 00:20:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and said that they thought
Gillian had a learning

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.332 align:middle line:90%
difficulty.

00:20:31.332 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And her mother was naturally
devastated to hear that.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:90%
This is the 1930s, by the way.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And she went to see the school,
and they explained to her

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
what she thought she
should do, and that she

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:84%
should take Gillian to see
a specialist, some advice.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:90%
I guess it was a psychologist.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And Gillian said
she remembers going

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.170 align:middle line:90%
into the room with her mother.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.547 align:middle line:84%
Her mother dressed her
in her Sunday clothes

00:20:52.547 --> 00:20:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and put out her best shoes
on and tied to her back

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and so she would look
very presentable.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.302 align:middle line:84%
And she said she remembers going
into this room, an oak panel

00:21:00.302 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
room with leather-bound
books everywhere,

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and this large desk, and this
man in a three-piece tweed suit

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.290 align:middle line:90%
and sitting down with him.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And then he has to go and sit
in the far end of the room

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:90%
on this leather sofa.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And he talked to her moth
about all the problems

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Gillian was having and now
started to describe them.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And she said all this time that
her mother was speaking to him,

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.183 align:middle line:90%
he was staring at Gillian.

00:21:23.183 --> 00:21:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I
was uncomfortable,

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting on my
hands so I wouldn't fidget.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And so now, this went
on for several minutes.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.573 align:middle line:84%
And then he stood up and
he said to Gillian, look.

00:21:31.573 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
This has been very
interesting, Gillian,

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:84%
but I need to speak to
your mother privately now.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you wait here,
we're going to leave you,

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:90%
but we'll be back.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.593 align:middle line:90%
We won't be very far away.

00:21:40.593 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
We'll come back
in a few minutes.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And she said they got
up and they went out.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But as they went out, he
leaned across his desk

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:90%
and turned the radio on.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And they got into
the car, apparently,

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and he turned to her mother
and said, just stand here

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.927 align:middle line:84%
for a moment, Mrs.
Lynne, and watch her.

00:21:53.927 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:90%
See what she does.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:84%
See said there was a
window back into the room

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.627 align:middle line:84%
so that she couldn't see
them, but they could see her.

00:21:59.627 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And she said the minute
they were out of the room,

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:84%
she was on their feet,
moving to the music.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So she danced around on top
of the sofa, on the tables.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.688 align:middle line:84%
And she said because she'd
been sitting still for so long.

00:22:11.688 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And apparently they watch
this for a couple of minutes.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%
And he turned to her mother.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Mrs. Lynne,
Jillian isn't sick.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.040 align:middle line:90%
She's a dancer.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Take her to a dance school.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what happened?

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:90%
She said, well, she did.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the
Royal Ballet School.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.455 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I walked
into this room and said,

00:22:30.455 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget it.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
It was full of people like me,
people who couldn't sit still.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And as she put it, "people
had to move to think."

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And she said she did the full
program at the ballet school.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.503 align:middle line:84%
She was eventually accepted
into the Royal Ballet.

00:22:44.503 --> 00:22:46.170 align:middle line:84%
She joined the corps
de ballet, and then

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
she became a soloist, a
principal and soloist,

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and had a wonderful career
at the Royal Ballet,

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:90%
traveled the world with them.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, when she left,
she formed our own company,

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.758 align:middle line:90%
the Gillian Lynne Dance Company.

00:22:57.758 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Put all kinds of productions on
in Broadway and the West End.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Then she met Andrew Lloyd
Webber as an accomplished

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.735 align:middle line:84%
and very successful dancer and
choreographer at this point.

00:23:05.735 --> 00:23:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And Andrew asked
her if she would

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
choreograph "Cats,"
which she did,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and "Phantom of the Opera."

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And other of his
productions, she

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:84%
became his principal
choreographer.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, she went on
to give pleasure to millions

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and became a multi-millionaire.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's perfectly possible
these days that somebody else

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.920 align:middle line:84%
would tell her to sit down, calm
down, and take these tablets.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.340 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't sick.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:90%
She was a dancer.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And I feel this for an
awful lot of people,

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.010 align:middle line:84%
that if you stereotype people
against a very narrow view

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:84%
of ability, then
you automatically

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
generate a very big conception
of inability and, at worst,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.410 align:middle line:90%
a disability.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
this from firsthand.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was in
special ed as a kid.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about this a while back.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I got polio when I was four.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I was from a
big working-class family

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.560 align:middle line:90%
in Liverpool.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1950s, there was
an epidemic that swept right

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:90%
across Europe and America.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:90%
And anyway, I got it.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But until the age of four,
my father particularly

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.340 align:middle line:84%
was convinced I was
going to be the soccer

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.548 align:middle line:84%
player in the family, because
we were right next door

00:24:13.548 --> 00:24:15.230 align:middle line:90%
to Everton's football ground.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my brother Neil
went on to play for them

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:90%
as a professional player.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, this disease was
ripping through the place,

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and I got it.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And the upshot was that
when I came out of hospital,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I was on two calipers,
had crutches, and was

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:84%
in a wheelchair,
and was, as I've

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.445 align:middle line:84%
said in the past,
tremendously acute.

00:24:38.445 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:90%
I was like a money machine.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.778 align:middle line:84%
People just spontaneously
gave me cash in the street.

00:24:41.778 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
It was fantastic.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I've often thought I might
return to that, really,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.360 align:middle line:90%
if all else fails, but--

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.332 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES: I don't think
it's as effective in LA.

00:24:49.332 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:90%
You're still cute, Ken.

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Trust me.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.257 align:middle line:10%
>>KEN: But I went
into special ed

00:24:58.257 --> 00:24:59.590 align:middle line:10%
when I came out of the hospital.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I was five, and I'm surrounded
by people with all kinds

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:05.643 align:middle line:90%
of physical difficulties.

00:25:05.643 --> 00:25:07.060 align:middle line:84%
There were lot of
kids with polio,

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:84%
there were kids
with hydrocephalus,

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
kids with cerebral palsy,
partially sighted, blind-deaf.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I always hesitate to draw
any kind of straight line.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing now what
I do because of that.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But there's no doubt that
having had that experience

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:84%
informs how I think about things
now and has done for a while.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Because it would be
odd not to draw from

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
experiences to contextualize
it a little more.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And I felt that at the
time, we were in that school

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
because we all had some
form of physical disability.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.333 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't interest
any of us as kids.

00:25:53.333 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
We weren't going
around, assessing

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:84%
other people's disabilities and
trying to find out about them.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:84%
We were just kids hanging
out, like kids do.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And you formed
friendships if you

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
found somebody interesting,
or funny, or attractive,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:90%
as you do as a kid.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.657 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're five, you
have crushes on other kids,

00:26:08.657 --> 00:26:11.160 align:middle line:90%
and it's just another society.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And for us, that wasn't the
distinguishing characteristic,

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:84%
nor was it, in our view, the
most interesting about us.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've always kind of clung
to that, that a lot of the kids

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
there were thought to
have learning difficulties

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.160 align:middle line:84%
whether they did or
they didn't in virtue

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
disability they had.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you have, as
some kids do, if they

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
had cerebral palsy or a symptom
associated with cerebral palsy,

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.240 align:middle line:84%
they might find it very
difficult to speak.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a culture where
we associate intelligence

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.340 align:middle line:84%
with clarity of speech,
the automatic assumption

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.757 align:middle line:84%
is that there was something
wrong with their mind

00:26:44.757 --> 00:26:46.840 align:middle line:84%
as well, with their
intellectual capacities, which

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.580 align:middle line:90%
then may or may not have been.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I used to find that when
I was getting on buses

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:90%
or going in public--

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:90%
I still occasionally get it.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
If I get on public
transport, people

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:59.230 align:middle line:84%
will speak a little louder to
me or with some slightly more

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.120 align:middle line:84%
exaggerated pronunciation
to make sure I

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:90%
am getting what they're saying.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:90%
And you just got amused by it.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But you know that there are
these sort of cultural--

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:84%
or people try even harder
than normal to act naturally.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.952 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a wheelchair,
you get that a lot.

00:27:17.952 --> 00:27:18.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I travel a lot.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the last few years I've
given in to family pressure.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So I've had a complete
180 about this.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:90%
I used to walk around airports.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I went everywhere on my
own, and just get older,

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and things just get
harder to get around, so.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But since I was in a
wheelchair as a kid,

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I was in no rush to
get back into one.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It was a big liberation
for me to get out

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.713 align:middle line:84%
of It so I used to have
people say, why don't you get

00:27:41.713 --> 00:27:42.880 align:middle line:90%
a wheelchair at the airport?

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.088 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can't really
quite explain this to you,

00:27:45.088 --> 00:27:46.042 align:middle line:90%
but I don't want to.

00:27:46.042 --> 00:27:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Because I know I'll end up
back in one at some point,

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.283 align:middle line:90%
but not yet.

00:27:49.283 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So I used to walk
around these airports.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And people would come at me and
say, do you want a wheelchair?

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'd shout at
them in my mind.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was polite and British
about the whole situation,

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.170 align:middle line:90%
obviously.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But I know I don't
want a wheelchair.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've done a complete 180
since I've started taking them,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and I get irritated when my
wheelchair is not waiting

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.123 align:middle line:90%
when I come off the plane.

00:28:07.123 --> 00:28:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Like, where the hell is it?

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in the
wheelchair, if I'm

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
with one of the
people I work with,

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.770 align:middle line:84%
or traveling with my wife,
or my son, or my daughter,

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:84%
you get to check-in,
and people will

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:84%
talk to the person pushing
the wheelchair, not to me.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And they will say things like,
does he have a boarding pass?

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'll go, actually,
you can ask me.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, I say that
not because I think

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that that's an
unusual experience,

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.270 align:middle line:90%
but because it's not.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:41.380 align:middle line:84%
On the whole, if people
have some visible physical

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:84%
difficulty, it sets off a
chain of reactions with people.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It's true about
race and ethnicity.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.020 align:middle line:84%
People who don't have a lot
of friends from other cultures

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.440 align:middle line:84%
start acting over-naturally
in their company.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.000 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me very
often they overcompensate

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.620 align:middle line:90%
to show I'm fine with this.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.533 align:middle line:90%
I'm cool with this.

00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:10%
And it's no more than
to say that people

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.020 align:middle line:10%
have a difficulty
with difference,

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes, they
get blinded by it.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:10%
So I know that a lot of
kids I was at school with

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of kids
I've seen subsequently

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:10%
in special education may
have wonderful abilities

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:10%
in all sorts of
other areas which

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.810 align:middle line:10%
are obscured in the eyes of the
beholder by their preoccupation

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:10%
with a particular disability
that may or may not

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.857 align:middle line:10%
be the problem the
person is dealing with.

00:29:29.857 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's more than that, really.

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've said it recently.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I've never yet come across
anybody, truthfully,

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:39.050 align:middle line:84%
anybody anywhere who
doesn't have special needs.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.960 align:middle line:90%
We all have them, everyone.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.430 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of it.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.170 align:middle line:90%
They may be imagined.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.940 align:middle line:84%
People may have some
worry about the shape

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:90%
and size of their nose.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
It might be their
top preoccupation.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole world is
upset about their earlobes

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.470 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is, it's something.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's all in the nature
of the human condition

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.000 align:middle line:84%
that people are insecure in
some areas about themselves.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It's about how they come across
that they're insecure socially.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So you can't properly, I
think, consider something

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:17.058 align:middle line:84%
as human, personal, and
consequential as education

00:30:17.058 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:84%
without understanding that, and
without taking account of it,

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that all education
is about relationships.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It's about connections that
you make or fail to make.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.828 align:middle line:84%
And that if you make a proper
connection with somebody,

00:30:28.828 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:84%
and if you see them
for who they are,

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.790 align:middle line:84%
you can literally transform the
whole course of their lives,

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.555 align:middle line:90%
and great teachers do that.

00:30:35.555 --> 00:30:37.180 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly true
of my life and it's

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.888 align:middle line:84%
true for most people's
lives that I know.

00:30:38.888 --> 00:30:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES: Mm.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.850 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
some of the concepts

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that you have for,
say, broadening

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.127 align:middle line:84%
our educational scope, some
of the concepts you talk about

00:30:52.127 --> 00:30:53.460 align:middle line:90%
are encouraging more creativity.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
That's the cornerstone
of a lot of your work.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And you talk in terms of
not just that it's creative,

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.280 align:middle line:84%
but that it encourages children
to have a go, to make mistakes,

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.080 align:middle line:90%
to step out.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is such a
critically important skill.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.128 align:middle line:84%
I've been aware on this as an
entrepreneur and making films.

00:31:09.128 --> 00:31:10.545 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly
making mistakes.

00:31:10.545 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:84%
You're always learning,
always growing.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Why is it important for kids to
be encouraged to be creative?

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN: Well, creativity is one
of the defining characteristics

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:28.050 align:middle line:90%
of our species.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the things
that makes us human

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.550 align:middle line:90%
and that identifies us as human.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And there are others
which are connected.

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we're concerned
with helping people

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:90%
realize who they are--

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, realize in both
senses, understand who they are

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and bring that about and
to become the fullest

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.050 align:middle line:90%
version of themselves--

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.630 align:middle line:84%
then it pays us to
think, well, what

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:08.430 align:middle line:84%
are these things that are
characteristic of our humanity?

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.840 align:middle line:84%
In most respects, we are like
the rest of life on Earth.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
in particular the past 300

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.853 align:middle line:84%
years, so many people seem
to have forgotten that.

00:32:18.853 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I was listening
recently to an interview

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:84%
with Toni Morrison,
who died recently,

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.920 align:middle line:84%
the Nobel novelist,
Nobel writer.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And she was making
a very simple point,

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.260 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very important point.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.730 align:middle line:84%
She was asked
about her portrayal

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:41.220 align:middle line:84%
of animals in her novels and how
intimately she describes them.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And she was saying that
when she was growing up--

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's certainly true
for my parents' generation

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and definitely of my
grandparents' generation,

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:84%
even though we grew
up in the city,

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and certainly true for the
vast majority of people

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.840 align:middle line:90%
in the pre-industrial period.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Animals weren't incidental
to people's lives.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:84%
They were intimately
connected with our lives

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.690 align:middle line:84%
not as pets, but as part of
the ecosystem in which they

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:90%
lived and depended.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Farmers had cattle and sheep.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
other animals which

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.380 align:middle line:84%
they knew by name,
which were part of--

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and they still are, of course,
in rural parts of the world.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.627 align:middle line:84%
And we had an intimate
relationship as a--

00:33:22.627 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:84%
we didn't until the
industrial period.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.580 align:middle line:84%
We had an intimate relationship
with the natural world

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.170 align:middle line:90%
in every respect.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.970 align:middle line:84%
People understood the
pattern of seasons.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They understood the pattern
of weather formationd.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:37.230 align:middle line:84%
They understood, intuitively,
the different characteristics

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and personalities almost of
animals they worked with,

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.790 align:middle line:90%
depended upon, lived from.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.565 align:middle line:84%
They were an intimate
part of the human economy,

00:33:45.565 --> 00:33:47.940 align:middle line:84%
as they still are, in a sense
in some parts of the world.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But in recent years with
the growth of industrialism

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and consumerism and the
systems of mass food production

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and consumption, we've
become distanced from them.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And now, our
relationship with animals

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.680 align:middle line:84%
is reduced to, often, this
rather exaggerated sense

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of affection for
individual pets.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
And many are people who have
become tremendously sentimental

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:15.060 align:middle line:84%
about pets, household
pets, will nonetheless

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.260 align:middle line:84%
sit by and watch the mass
slaughter of animals for food

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that eat burgers at the
table and feed bits of them

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:25.920 align:middle line:84%
to their pets with a kind
of dewy-eyed sentiment

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and not recognize the
carnage that's being wrought

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:90%
on the planet as a consequence.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.239 align:middle line:84%
So Toni Morrison's
point was that we

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:84%
used to have this very intimate
relationship with animals

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.560 align:middle line:90%
in our ecosystem.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And part of my point
is in most respects,

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:48.090 align:middle line:84%
we are just like the
rest of life on Earth.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Most of the
creatures, the mammals

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
especially and
what we think of as

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:84%
the higher-order
animals, ones like us.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not ones that live
in shells all the time.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.880 align:middle line:90%


00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We know they have
feelings, sensibilities.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.150 align:middle line:84%
They have affections,
they mourn, they grieve.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:90%
They exalt, they raise children.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The fact they're a
different form of life

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.408 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean they're
separate from us

00:35:16.408 --> 00:35:17.700 align:middle line:90%
or that we should despise them.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.860 align:middle line:90%
We may know this to be true.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.140 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
respects-- and a big part

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:84%
of what I'm arguing for
is that we should restore

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.792 align:middle line:84%
those connections, or at least
restore our sense of compassion

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:30.000 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of life on
Earth rather than wreak havoc

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.412 align:middle line:90%
against it that we're doing.

00:35:32.412 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:84%
But there are
clearly some respects

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.105 align:middle line:90%
in which we are different.

00:35:35.105 --> 00:35:36.563 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
silly to deny them.

00:35:36.563 --> 00:35:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, on the contrary, it
behooves us to understand them

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:90%
and to cultivate them.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
are sitting here,

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by
advanced technology.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.038 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not being
interviewed by a llama.

00:35:50.038 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that there are other
creatures outside holding

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.420 align:middle line:84%
conferences and got their
own version of the iPad.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:84%
There are some things
that human beings

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.325 align:middle line:84%
are capable of that no other
species has showed itself,

00:36:00.325 --> 00:36:01.450 align:middle line:90%
at least so far as we know.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And among them is that, I
mean, well, for example,

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
my wife and I have recently
become grandparents.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And we have a granddaughter
now who is 16 months.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, we're very pleased,
because we feel very blessed

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:84%
by this, because
it turns out she's

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:24.640 align:middle line:84%
the most beautiful, gifted
child ever to be born.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.815 align:middle line:84%
So we're feeling a bit
privileged by that.

00:36:26.815 --> 00:36:28.690 align:middle line:84%
I feel sorry for all
these other grandparents

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.732 align:middle line:84%
who are dealing with these
second-order kids, so.

00:36:30.732 --> 00:36:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But we look at our grandchild
and you look at any baby.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.768 align:middle line:84%
Think of your own children
when they're born.

00:36:40.768 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Think of yourself
when you were born.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:47.870 align:middle line:84%
As human beings, we have
boundless capacities.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:84%
We're capable of the most
extraordinary things.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Most other creatures, so far as
we can tell, live in the world

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:57.160 align:middle line:90%
pretty much as they find it.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.090 align:middle line:84%
They adapt to the
world around them.

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
They are evolved to live
in the environment they

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:90%
find themselves in.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.540 align:middle line:84%
They only function in
certain sorts of environment.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.800 align:middle line:84%
You move them out of
those environments,

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.430 align:middle line:84%
they don't function
very well at all,

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
which is why we're facing
the next big extinction,

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:11.742 align:middle line:84%
because we're
diligently destroying

00:37:11.742 --> 00:37:14.200 align:middle line:84%
the environment that all these
other creatures depend upon.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:14.840 align:middle line:90%
They can't decide.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, look.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.945 align:middle line:84%
I think what we'll do
is we'll move to Sydney

00:37:16.945 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and see how things
work out there.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.280 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, we adapt
to our environments,

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and we also change them
and construct environments.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And among the reasons
are that as human beings,

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:34.360 align:middle line:84%
we have an entirely
different order

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:84%
of intellectual and
emotional capacities.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.180 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most
obvious one to mention

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.850 align:middle line:84%
is we have an extraordinary
capacity for speech.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here we are using it.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Children aren't born speaking.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.040 align:middle line:84%
They don't come out of the
womb saying, that was close.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go through
that again in a rush.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.370 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't happen.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They sit, then they
burble, and they babble.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And that goes on
for about 18 months,

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and they start to form
words here and there.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But most kids in
ordinary circumstances,

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.470 align:middle line:84%
by the time they're
two or three,

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:13.990 align:middle line:90%
have got the hang of speech.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can see they're
straining to get it as well.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.805 align:middle line:84%
But nobody teaches
them how to do it.

00:38:18.805 --> 00:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
As a parent, you don't sit
your child down and say,

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.370 align:middle line:84%
look, we need to talk, and tell
them how it's going to work.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.800 align:middle line:84%
They figure it out, and they
do it because they want to

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and they can.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:28.870 align:middle line:90%
I know people--

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to
somebody last night,

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:84%
for example, who speaks seven
languages comfortably, not

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.710 align:middle line:84%
because she's
linguistically gifted,

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.870 align:middle line:84%
but because that's
how her life fell out

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.250 align:middle line:84%
over the course of
the first 20 years.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're all capable of
learning multiple languages.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.220 align:middle line:90%
No other creature is.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Not language as we know
it, not sophisticated,

00:38:53.650 --> 00:39:00.160 align:middle line:84%
interactive language that convey
a host of innumerable meanings.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Kids learn quite
quickly the noises

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.710 align:middle line:90%
we make aren't meaningless.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.630 align:middle line:90%
They refer to things.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
words that do that.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.070 align:middle line:90%
Images do it.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Musical sounds do it.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.400 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world
invested with meaning.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And as the great Clifford
Geertz once said,

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:84%
a cultural anthropologist,
"As human beings,

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.550 align:middle line:84%
we are suspended in
webs of significance

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.560 align:middle line:90%
that we ourselves have spun."

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the world
directly as we grow.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.080 align:middle line:84%
We learn to speak well
and not only to speak

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:84%
but we learn other
cultural systems.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.310 align:middle line:90%
We learn mathematics.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.020 align:middle line:90%
We learn behavioral codes.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.780 align:middle line:84%
We learn what's OK
to do round here.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.550 align:middle line:90%
We learn values, belief systems.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:90%
We learn about food.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:84%
We learn how to dress
ourselves, all these things.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And then if we have access to
education in the right way,

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.300 align:middle line:84%
we learn that the world
exists before we got here,

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.940 align:middle line:90%
that there's a history to it.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.120 align:middle line:84%
There have been thousands of
generations before we got here.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.030 align:middle line:84%
With luck, there'll
be thousands more.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.020 align:middle line:84%
That we live in a
huge, unending cosmos.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And our minds and
conscious become expanded,

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and we start to learn
the skills to move around

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and to connect
with other people.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.140 align:middle line:84%
All of that is available
to us when we're born,

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:13.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's not in us
when we're born.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.870 align:middle line:90%
We have to cultivate that.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that human
resources, to use the term,

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.270 align:middle line:84%
are just like the world's
natural resources.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:90%
They are highly diverse.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.730 align:middle line:84%
We all have multiple
talents, many of which

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:28.720 align:middle line:90%
we never discover.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll all go to our
graves unaware of things

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that we might have been able to
do had the opportunity come up.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:37.930 align:middle line:90%
I often think about this.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:39.970 align:middle line:84%
In the Pacific,
there are kids who

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.890 align:middle line:84%
go diving for pearls who
can hold their breath

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.260 align:middle line:90%
underwater in minutes on end.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Any kid living in Los Angeles
could learn to do that,

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that they would
have the capacity.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.900 align:middle line:84%
It's just that pearl diving
isn't a big calling round here.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.650 align:middle line:90%
It's just not something--

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Any kid in the
17th century could

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.010 align:middle line:84%
have learned to rap or to
play the electric guitar,

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:90%
but there wasn't a call for it.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
extraordinary capacities.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:84%
What becomes them depends
on opportunity, disposition,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and circumstance, a big
part of which is education.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And in a very literal
sense, creativity

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:90%
is how we compose our lives.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Among these capacities, the root
of it, I think, is imagination.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Imagination is a power we
completely take for granted,

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.145 align:middle line:84%
for it's the capacity to bring
to mind things that aren't

00:41:30.145 --> 00:41:33.390 align:middle line:84%
present, to
anticipate the future,

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to anticipate possible
futures, to revisit the past,

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.620 align:middle line:84%
to try and see things from
other people's points of view.

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:84%
We can compose in
our minds things

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.830 align:middle line:90%
that are entirely improbable.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.240 align:middle line:90%
They are imaginary.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.490 align:middle line:84%
We can come up with
ideas for things

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:48.900 align:middle line:90%
that weren't around before.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.760 align:middle line:90%
We can be imaginative.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.730 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts of ways
in which we use this capacity.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is the
executive wing imagination.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.350 align:middle line:84%
It's putting your
imagination to work.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we learn to
speak, but then we

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.910 align:middle line:84%
start to compose
novel sentences.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And the best example,
I think, of creative it

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:90%
is our own lives.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.100 align:middle line:90%
We all compose our own lives.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.490 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know, there have
been somewhere around 100

00:42:11.490 --> 00:42:13.620 align:middle line:84%
billion human beings
like us who've

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:16.770 align:middle line:84%
drawn breath and lived on this
Earth over the past 200,000

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean
prehistoric creatures.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean groovy people
like you and me,

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.380 align:middle line:84%
people with our sensibilities
and our capacities,

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.630 align:middle line:90%
about 100 billion of us.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And every single life has
been different, unrepeatable,

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.280 align:middle line:90%
unique.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Every biography is original
to the person who's living it.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we all do,
that we create the lives

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that we live through
the possibilities we see

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:47.755 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunities we take,
or the ones we step away from.

00:42:47.755 --> 00:42:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wrote the
book a few years back

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:90%
called "The Element--

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.875 align:middle line:84%
How Finding Your Passion
Changes Everything."

00:42:51.875 --> 00:42:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's how people's
lives are transformed

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.760 align:middle line:84%
by discovering a talent and
the passion and purpose that

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.962 align:middle line:90%
goes with it.

00:42:57.962 --> 00:43:01.480 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Gillian
Lynne story's about.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And creativity, in other words,
isn't some exotic byproduct

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that happens to be
present in a few people.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.270 align:middle line:84%
We've come to think of it
that way, but it's not true.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is the
pulse of human life.

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:23.940 align:middle line:84%
We live in a city that wasn't
here 150 years ago like this.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.490 align:middle line:84%
This has been created
by the interplay

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:29.800 align:middle line:84%
of millions of minds working
together, collaborating.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Where all of us now are based in
the great net of the World Wide

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:38.067 align:middle line:84%
Web and all of its works,
this is new to our generation.

00:43:38.067 --> 00:43:39.150 align:middle line:90%
This didn't happen before.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.800 align:middle line:90%
It didn't come into being.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.870 align:middle line:84%
It didn't come around
like the oceans.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.288 align:middle line:90%
We made this.

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Somebody designed the
clothes that we wear.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Creativity is what contributes
to the nature of our humanity.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.880 align:middle line:84%
We can use it and
we can misuse it.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I'm saying that
education should cultivate

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:08.400 align:middle line:84%
children's creative capacities
isn't kind of an appeal

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.930 align:middle line:84%
to have some extra hour of
free-play-based activities

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.910 align:middle line:84%
on a Friday afternoon,
though I think

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:17.550 align:middle line:84%
we should have free-play-based
activities on a Friday

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:18.510 align:middle line:90%
afternoon.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:22.110 align:middle line:84%
It's to recognize that there
is a set of capacities here

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:23.580 align:middle line:84%
which isn't separate
from, but it's

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.190 align:middle line:84%
integrated with everything
else that we do.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But it is both the gift
and the peril of humanity,

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.480 align:middle line:84%
because all the crises that
we currently face on Earth

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:84%
are the product of our various
preoccupations, culture

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and otherwise.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.117 align:middle line:84%
We have created these
crises, and we're

00:44:45.117 --> 00:44:47.700 align:middle line:84%
going to have to get even more
creative working to solve them.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.770 align:middle line:84%
We've created the
food crisis, and we've

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:90%
created the economic crisis.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.020 align:middle line:84%
We've created the
climate crisis.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we were to
solve them, we have

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.330 align:middle line:84%
to get even more
creative, not less.

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:00.600 align:middle line:84%
But what's true of our behavior
as a species is true for us

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.870 align:middle line:90%
as individuals.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:03.075 align:middle line:90%
So it's not incidental.

00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:04.450 align:middle line:84%
It's why I'm so
interested in it.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not because I think
it's a footnote to humanity.

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:09.535 align:middle line:90%
It's the main text.

00:45:09.535 --> 00:45:10.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES: Interesting.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating how
you weave together

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.600 align:middle line:84%
this concept of creativity
and also manifestation

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.580 align:middle line:84%
of visualization,
this concept to think

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.390 align:middle line:84%
about other alternative futures,
to visualize an outcome.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's a skill
that sometimes people

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:27.883 align:middle line:84%
are not taught or learn until
much later in life, when

00:45:27.883 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:84%
they're doing their
own, say, personal--

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.050 align:middle line:84%
it's called personal
development now.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:33.217 align:middle line:84%
It seems like in a lot of
personal development work,

00:45:33.217 --> 00:45:35.130 align:middle line:84%
learning about
these creative ideas

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:37.020 align:middle line:84%
about manifesting
your life or creating

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:84%
things are things
that people go through

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.580 align:middle line:90%
during a midlife crisis.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.830 align:middle line:90%
And they're not really taught.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN: I think part of this
is that when we learn to speak

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and when we learn languages--
not just being able to write

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.510 align:middle line:90%
and to read and so on--

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:55.400 align:middle line:84%
when we become
participants in a culture,

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.370 align:middle line:84%
as we all do eventually,
we don't just

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.002 align:middle line:90%
learn to convey ideas.

00:46:00.002 --> 00:46:01.460 align:middle line:84%
We're learning ways
of having them.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.660 align:middle line:84%
We use concepts
that are embedded

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.310 align:middle line:84%
in the language or
relationships that

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:08.660 align:middle line:90%
are embedded in the language.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I always find it
interesting to ask people

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.370 align:middle line:84%
who speak several languages
if they think differently

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.300 align:middle line:90%
in these languages, and they do.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.100 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.163 align:middle line:84%
They think definitely
about things.

00:46:18.163 --> 00:46:19.580 align:middle line:84%
They think about
different things.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And they often will flip
from one language to the next

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to say something, which isn't
as easy in the language they

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.990 align:middle line:90%
were speaking at the time.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And embedded in our language
for all kinds of categories.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
feature to me

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that the things that we're
using language describe

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.130 align:middle line:84%
are different from the words
we're using to describe them.

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:44.290 align:middle line:90%
We're approximating.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
philosopher who

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I think is too neglected
now, but her name

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:53.810 align:middle line:84%
was Susanne Langer, an
American philosopher.

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.060 align:middle line:84%
She was a student
of Ann Whitehead

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.527 align:middle line:84%
and published a lot
in the '40s and '50s.

00:46:58.527 --> 00:47:00.610 align:middle line:84%
She wrote a book called
"Philosophy in a New Key,"

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's about how language
provides not just language,

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:07.250 align:middle line:84%
but our capacity for
representational thought.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:10.010 align:middle line:84%
It provides templates to which
we organize our experience.

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:11.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a subtle
and dynamic process.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.700 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.012 align:middle line:90%
But she says, for example--

00:47:15.012 --> 00:47:16.970 align:middle line:84%
she talks about the
difference between language

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:21.320 align:middle line:90%
and visual art.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we're speaking, we're
using a systematic process

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.520 align:middle line:90%
of representation.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think of this as
systemic and schematic symbols.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But what she was saying,
and she's not alone

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:38.870 align:middle line:84%
to have said this, is that
when we're using words,

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.038 align:middle line:90%
words have particular meanings.

00:47:41.038 --> 00:47:42.830 align:middle line:84%
They're not confined
to them, because words

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:44.180 align:middle line:90%
have all kinds of resonances.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, all sorts
of shades, and nuances,

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:46.970 align:middle line:90%
and reverberations.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.890 align:middle line:84%
But at the heart of it,
words mean this and not that.

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And some word
means other things.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell, if you
come across in your words,

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.238 align:middle line:84%
you can look it up
in a dictionary.

00:47:55.238 --> 00:47:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And it says, this
is what this means.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And it can mean something
more if a poet's using it

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:04.340 align:middle line:90%
in a particular setting.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:07.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's a systematic
symbolism, and some things

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:10.525 align:middle line:84%
mean things in certain
sequences and not in others.

00:48:10.525 --> 00:48:12.650 align:middle line:84%
There was a lovely book
published a number of years

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:14.608 align:middle line:84%
ago that became a bit of
a sensation in the UK.

00:48:14.608 --> 00:48:17.240 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Eats,
Shoots, and Leaves."

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about the kind of
fabled debate about the Oxford

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.730 align:middle line:84%
comma, whether you need the
comma in there or you don't.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But it there's a comma in
there after the shoots, then

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.290 align:middle line:84%
the whole sentence starts
to mean something else.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.990 align:middle line:90%
"Eats, Shoots, and Leaves."

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:37.505 align:middle line:84%
Well, they'd probably
describe that

00:48:37.505 --> 00:48:39.770 align:middle line:84%
as something that
happened in the bar

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.920 align:middle line:84%
or in a restaurant where there
was some violent altercation.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.930 align:middle line:84%
But if it's just "Eat,
Shoots and Leaves,"

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:47.950 align:middle line:84%
you're probably describing
the dietary habits of one

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:49.500 align:middle line:90%
of the larger primates.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.870 align:middle line:84%
So but you know that this is
a systematic symbolism that

00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:56.450 align:middle line:84%
has encoded meanings
that mean certain things,

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's unlikely they
would mean something else.

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And the whole point
about speech is you're

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.050 align:middle line:90%
trying to be precise about it.

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But as Susanne Langer says,
and others have said it, too,

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.037 align:middle line:84%
some ideas go perfectly well
into words and some don't.

00:49:11.037 --> 00:49:12.620 align:middle line:84%
There are some things
you can't really

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.600 align:middle line:90%
put into words quite so easily.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Poets can try it, but it's
not a literal meaning.

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.540 align:middle line:84%
We turn to metaphors and
analogies to capture this.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And so she said, so putting
some ideas into words

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.097 align:middle line:84%
is a bit like seeing
clothes on a washing line.

00:49:28.097 --> 00:49:29.680 align:middle line:84%
You string them up,
but the experience

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.267 align:middle line:84%
is of wearing them all wrapped
up inside of each other.

00:49:32.267 --> 00:49:33.350 align:middle line:90%
That's not the experience.

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:36.620 align:middle line:84%
That's a way of thinking
about the experience.

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at a painting,
all the information's

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.350 align:middle line:90%
there right now.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Where as if you're
listening to a sentence,

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.340 align:middle line:84%
you have to hear
where it's going to.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.770 align:middle line:90%
It's time based, like music.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a time-based symbolism.

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Where a painting is all or not.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.100 align:middle line:84%
There's no more information
in the painting than what

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:90%
you can see right now.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.310 align:middle line:84%
This contextual information,
you learn about it.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:54.175 align:middle line:84%
But the paintings
right there right now.

00:49:54.175 --> 00:49:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But that's another
example of how

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:58.130 align:middle line:84%
we try to render our
experience intelligible

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.170 align:middle line:90%
through representation.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And part of the way we
tend to think in English--

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's true of a lot of the
traditions of Western thought--

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is to therefore make
distinctions between things.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.835 align:middle line:90%
It's this, its not that.

00:50:13.835 --> 00:50:14.960 align:middle line:90%
It's how dictionaries work.

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.600 align:middle line:90%
It means this, not that.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the work
in academic philosophy,

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:26.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of work and academic
activities in general,

00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:28.430 align:middle line:84%
is based on a certain
type of reasoning,

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:30.860 align:middle line:84%
a logical, deductive reasoning,
making clear distinctions.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.240 align:middle line:90%
It's this, it's not that.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.570 align:middle line:84%
This is how this
differs from that.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like the great adventures
in the encyclopedic movement

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that began in Europe
which led to an attempt

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.330 align:middle line:90%
to classify all human knowledge.

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And it led to taxonomic
systems in natural history.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So we developed the idea of
different genera, and species,

00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.620 align:middle line:90%
and subspecies.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.965 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you go to the
natural history museum in any

00:51:01.965 --> 00:51:04.590 align:middle line:84%
of our great cities-- and I was
in one in London a little while

00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:05.443 align:middle line:90%
ago--

00:51:05.443 --> 00:51:07.860 align:middle line:84%
you walk through all these
different halls, and pavilions,

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.660 align:middle line:90%
and exhibitions.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:11.292 align:middle line:84%
And you see all these
different species all laid out.

00:51:11.292 --> 00:51:12.750 align:middle line:84%
I was writing about
it a while ago.

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:13.770 align:middle line:90%
So you can go into one.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a roomful
of butterflies,

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and they're all in
cases, organized

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:24.120 align:middle line:90%
by species, subspecies.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And they're arranged
beautifully in these cases.

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Large ones at the top,
small ones at the bottom,

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.960 align:middle line:90%
pinned, dead.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And you go to the next room.

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And there were beetles,
arachnids, all organized

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:39.360 align:middle line:90%
species by species, dead.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
way to understand

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:48.990 align:middle line:84%
the nature of species
and different genera

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:53.250 align:middle line:90%
from a biological point of view.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a good way to
study it, but it's not

00:51:55.290 --> 00:51:58.850 align:middle line:84%
how it is when you walk out
of the natural history museum.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.930 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the
countryside, you

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:05.160 align:middle line:84%
don't see rows of
flying butterflies

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.800 align:middle line:84%
kept in strict military
sequence with the large ones

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.510 align:middle line:84%
at the front, the
small ones at the back,

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and all the spiders
walking around over there,

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.110 align:middle line:84%
keeping their distance
and keeping themselves

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:14.010 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.710 align:middle line:84%
In nature, everything's
wrapped up in itself.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's similar
to me in the way

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:21.593 align:middle line:84%
we begin to discuss
human affairs,

00:52:21.593 --> 00:52:23.010 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
distinguish things

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:24.713 align:middle line:90%
about to talk about them.

00:52:24.713 --> 00:52:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
careful where we

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:31.660 align:middle line:84%
make that where we put the
dotted and the unbroken lines.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, people
talk about is creativity

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.060 align:middle line:90%
as important as academic work?

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.885 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally
false distinction.

00:52:40.885 --> 00:52:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most
creative people I know

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.120 align:middle line:90%
are writing academic treatises.

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Science has an academic
component to it.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:51.000 align:middle line:84%
That's to say, academic
work is about a certain type

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.948 align:middle line:84%
of logical deductive
reasoning and propositional

00:52:54.948 --> 00:52:57.240 align:middle line:84%
knowledge for the most part,
and knowledge of something

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.677 align:middle line:90%
is the case.

00:52:58.677 --> 00:53:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But knowledge takes
many forms, as you know.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we talked about
something being the case.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.380 align:middle line:84%
We can know that
something is true,

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.390 align:middle line:84%
or we can contend that
something is true,

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:10.920 align:middle line:90%
that this is a factual--

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.830 align:middle line:84%
like Elizabeth II is
the queen of England.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:15.210 align:middle line:90%
That's a proposition.

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.933 align:middle line:84%
We take it to be true,
we can verify it.

00:53:16.933 --> 00:53:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And we can go call
her up and say,

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:21.450 align:middle line:90%
is that what's still going on?

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.067 align:middle line:90%
We agree that's the situation.

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of education is
full of proposition knowledge,

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.672 align:middle line:84%
historical knowledge,
scientific knowledge,

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and other forms of knowledge.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Artistic, cultural knowledge.

00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:33.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's a whole
other area of work

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:35.850 align:middle line:90%
which is not knowing that.

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:37.090 align:middle line:90%
It's knowing how.

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:39.820 align:middle line:90%
How do you make this work?

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.640 align:middle line:90%
How do you put this together?

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I know this painting is by van
Gogh, but how did he do that?

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.992 align:middle line:84%
How could-- how
would you do that?

00:53:47.992 --> 00:53:49.200 align:middle line:90%
We know you're making a film.

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.000 align:middle line:90%
How do you do this?

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.057 align:middle line:84%
So the application of ideas
and the dialogue between theory

00:53:54.057 --> 00:53:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and practice is intimate in the
growth of human civilizations.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Education.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.160 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
has become focus

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:01.950 align:middle line:84%
on the theoretical
aspects, knowing that.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:04.470 align:middle line:84%
That's what academic
work tends to do.

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It works more at the theoretical
level than the practical level,

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.310 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact the world
is a very practical place,

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and we need to put
ideas into practice,

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:13.710 align:middle line:90%
and see the feedback loop.

00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:17.340 align:middle line:84%
There's also another way of
knowing, which is knowing this,

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.410 align:middle line:84%
knowing what's happened
now between you me.

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Knowing what happens when you
hold your child, knowing what

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.940 align:middle line:84%
happens when you're
feeling hungry.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Knowing what happens when you
lose somebody that you love,

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.350 align:middle line:90%
the nature of human experience.

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's not dealt with
by the academic world.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:32.820 align:middle line:90%
In fact, on the contrary.

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the false
distinctions that's

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:37.223 align:middle line:84%
made very often in education
is between knowing and feeling,

00:54:37.223 --> 00:54:38.640 align:middle line:84%
when they're
intimately connected.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.170 align:middle line:84%
This is like the
butterfly on the wall.

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I think we know things
because we feel them.

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:44.587 align:middle line:84%
And we feel certain
things because

00:54:44.587 --> 00:54:45.900 align:middle line:90%
of what we know about them.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
talk about creativity,

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:53.220 align:middle line:84%
is it important as
well as academic work?

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to unscramble
the whole equation.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.120 align:middle line:84%
So what we've now found
ourselves in a situation

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.265 align:middle line:84%
where kids in school
are being forced

00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:04.140 align:middle line:84%
to do all kinds of dreary
work which teachers

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.640 align:middle line:90%
don't want to do either.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.750 align:middle line:84%
They're preparing
themselves for tests.

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:12.230 align:middle line:84%
These tests are consequential,
foolishly and unnecessarily.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:15.920 align:middle line:84%
They're creating all
kinds of stress in kids.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.120 align:middle line:84%
They're creating
problems of retention.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.000 align:middle line:84%
The kids are being
medicated as a consequence.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.500 align:middle line:84%
We're being told
there, the problem,

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.750 align:middle line:84%
that they have a learning
disorder when actually, what

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:27.330 align:middle line:84%
they're being asked to
learn is itself inherently

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:29.190 align:middle line:90%
tedious and stressful.

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:32.713 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I find recently,
people have started to say,

00:55:32.713 --> 00:55:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I think what we really now
ought to be paying attention to

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:37.507 align:middle line:84%
are children's social and
emotional development.

00:55:37.507 --> 00:55:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're having
programs on a Thursday

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:42.280 align:middle line:84%
afternoon in social and
emotional development.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.790 align:middle line:90%
And all these things are--

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:47.920 align:middle line:84%
many of these things--
are the consequence

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:52.510 align:middle line:84%
of false conceptions about how
people work, how they connect.

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:55.782 align:middle line:84%
And if you remove
those sorts of ideas--

00:55:55.782 --> 00:55:57.490 align:middle line:84%
people have social
and emotional problems

00:55:57.490 --> 00:56:00.710 align:middle line:84%
if they don't connect with each
other or if they're kept apart.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:02.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like social
media at the moment.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.880 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a total misnomer.

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.080 align:middle line:90%
These are not social media.

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.450 align:middle line:84%
These are, for the most
part, anti-social media.

00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:09.760 align:middle line:84%
They're not helping
people connect.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.620 align:middle line:84%
They're disabling
people's capacity

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:13.520 align:middle line:90%
to connect on a personal level.

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's one of the
reasons I say I think

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:22.060 align:middle line:84%
we need to rethink education,
because trying to improve it

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:29.380 align:middle line:84%
based on misconceptions of how
a human mind, a human organism

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.760 align:middle line:84%
operates, how we are in
the world, how we relate

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to each other, how we
relate to the planet

00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:38.180 align:middle line:90%
is part of the problem.

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And unless we get
to the root of that

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and start to think in a more
integrated, more holistic, more

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:49.690 align:middle line:84%
humanistic way about our
place in the order of things,

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:54.012 align:middle line:84%
then we'll simply continue
refining a system that's

00:56:54.012 --> 00:56:56.470 align:middle line:84%
run its course and has created
all the problems that we now

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:58.144 align:middle line:90%
scratch our heads about.

00:56:58.144 --> 00:56:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES: Mm.

00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:02.535 align:middle line:84%
Interesting analogy
around the language.

00:57:02.535 --> 00:57:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I can empathize
with that deeply.

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:05.380 align:middle line:90%
My wife speaks five languages.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.660 align:middle line:90%
I speak half-English, really.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:09.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not really the
Queen's English.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.077 align:middle line:90%
>>KEN: I noticed that.

00:57:10.077 --> 00:57:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES: [LAUGHS] And I
learned Dutch recently,

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:16.180 align:middle line:84%
which is the most useless
language to learn,

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.500 align:middle line:84%
because they all
speak perfect English.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:18.180 align:middle line:90%
My wife's Dutch.

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, look,
I've heard it enough.

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:20.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll learn it.

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And I learned it,
and I realized I'm

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:24.640 align:middle line:84%
a completely different
person when I'm Dutch.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KEN: Is that right?

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.145 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES: I talk about
different things.

00:57:27.145 --> 00:57:28.510 align:middle line:90%
I joke about different things.

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:30.850 align:middle line:84%
People talk to me
about different things.

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I join conversations
in a unique way.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I make remarks about other
things that I would in English,

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.685 align:middle line:90%
and it's a fascinating concept.

00:57:40.685 --> 00:57:41.485 align:middle line:90%


00:57:41.485 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we compartmentalize
our whole experience of life

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:44.860 align:middle line:90%
based on our language.

00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And languages have
different set--

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.310 align:middle line:84%
because my wife will
switch from Dutch,

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to German, to English,
then to fluent French,

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.403 align:middle line:84%
and she changes
when she does that.

00:57:52.403 --> 00:57:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>KEN: You see it too?

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JAMES: Yes.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.600 align:middle line:84%
She's much more emotive,
much more in her heart

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.590 align:middle line:90%
when she's speaking French.

00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:58.423 align:middle line:84%
And when it's German
and English, it's here.

00:57:58.423 --> 00:58:00.890 align:middle line:90%
It's like, very precise.

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:02.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like she's a lawyer.

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
fascinating concept.

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KEN: It really is.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Terry and I were talking a
while ago with a young guy.

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:12.382 align:middle line:90%
He was driving a car for us.

00:58:12.382 --> 00:58:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And he's American.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.190 align:middle line:84%
We're in Hawaii, and
telling us about his life.

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.990 align:middle line:90%
He's a surfer.

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, Terry, my
wife, she speaks French.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
speak to me in French,

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:23.920 align:middle line:90%
and he picked up on that.

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out his
mother was French,

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and he was educated in
France as well as in America.

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:30.660 align:middle line:90%
So he switched to French.

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:31.250 align:middle line:90%
He was in the front of the car.

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:33.700 align:middle line:84%
But he not only switched to
French, he became French.

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.580 align:middle line:90%


00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.180 align:middle line:84%
He went from being
a surfing dude,

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.480 align:middle line:84%
this kind of groovy, kind
of swept back here in Hawaii

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:47.940 align:middle line:84%
to lounging around, [LAUGHS]
driving with one hand

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:48.970 align:middle line:90%
and being chic.

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:50.960 align:middle line:90%
It was just very just like that.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:52.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the language.

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:54.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the whole sensibility
that goes with it.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:55.770 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it's very interesting.

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:56.305 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:58:56.305 --> 00:58:57.763 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES: There's
this idea you have

00:58:57.763 --> 00:58:59.350 align:middle line:84%
about diversity
versus conformity,

00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and that in order
to succeed, we must

00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:04.630 align:middle line:90%
conform by all means possible.

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who really
breaks away from that

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:09.490 align:middle line:90%
is going to struggle.

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's conditioned, in
many ways, by our parents.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my father
was an accountant.

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.910 align:middle line:84%
He's like, go to school,
go to university.

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:16.935 align:middle line:90%
Get a good job.

00:59:16.935 --> 00:59:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And once you have a good
job and a steady paycheck,

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:20.200 align:middle line:90%
then good luck.

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Off you go.

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.918 align:middle line:90%
And I love playing music.

00:59:22.918 --> 00:59:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I love playing in a band.

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.710 align:middle line:90%
My dad would say, well--

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:28.328 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't say it, but
you knew what he meant

00:59:28.328 --> 00:59:29.620 align:middle line:90%
when he looked at you that way.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't be a musician.

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.870 align:middle line:90%
That's not possible.

00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:35.980 align:middle line:84%
All the musicians, all
artists are starving.

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Go get a good job.

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
this subtle mantra

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that's sort of beaten into us
either with verbal language

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.710 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So conformity is important.

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the whole
mid-life crisis situation where

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:48.850 align:middle line:90%
people are like, oh my god.

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:50.225 align:middle line:84%
I've been a lawyer
my whole life,

00:59:50.225 --> 00:59:51.740 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't want
to be a lawyer.

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:52.870 align:middle line:90%
I just hate that.

00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:54.200 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in a Jewish family.

00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.630 align:middle line:84%
My parents said you're going
to be a doctor or a lawyer.

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I ended up a lawyer.

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:58.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the dangers of
repeating this mantra,

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and how can we sort
of maybe be more

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.800 align:middle line:84%
proactive in our communication
with our children,

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.170 align:middle line:84%
or young adults,
or in our society

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:06.580 align:middle line:90%
to open up more possibilities?

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Because there's YouTube
stars earning 10 times,

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:13.090 align:middle line:84%
what, even the
most active person

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:15.420 align:middle line:90%
can earn following a good path.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN: Well, diversity is
the hallmark of human life,

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:26.390 align:middle line:84%
whereas diverse is
the natural world.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.190 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Individually, it's an admixture
of talent, disposition,

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.415 align:middle line:84%
personality, passions,
and interests.

01:00:33.415 --> 01:00:35.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, by passion, I
don't mean going around

01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
with a rose clamped between
your teeth and sweating

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:38.980 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, but knowing that we're
all drawn to different things,

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that we all love to
do sorts of things.

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I know people in all kinds of
occupations who live for it.

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
This book I did, "The
Element," was about that.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
To be in your
element is not only

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:02.128 align:middle line:84%
about doing things you're
good at, but it is that.

01:01:02.128 --> 01:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, things that
you're naturally good at.

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
If you start it
from a point of view

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
with a narrow
conception of ability,

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
then you automatically
cut people off

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
from all sorts of other
diverse talents and interests

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.890 align:middle line:90%
they could have.

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It's why I rail against the
academic bias of education

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.430 align:middle line:84%
not because I'm
against academic work.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:27.610 align:middle line:90%
On the contrary.

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I was a university professor.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
I did a PhD.

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:31.170 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I write books, but it's
not like I'm against it.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's not for everybody.

01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:41.515 align:middle line:84%
It would be like a
soccer player saying,

01:01:41.515 --> 01:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
nobody should play
any game but soccer.

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.610 align:middle line:90%
We should ban tennis.

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:46.885 align:middle line:84%
We should revile people who
are into playing baseball.

01:01:46.885 --> 01:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be
a ridiculous thing.

01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's a
very, very important set

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.045 align:middle line:90%
of cultural and personal skills.

01:01:54.045 --> 01:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And some people have it
in different degrees.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
somebody may not

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
be interested or be especially
good at conventional academic

01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
work doesn't mean that's the
end of the story in terms

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.760 align:middle line:90%
of their talent and interest.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.802 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that's
the end of their value

01:02:07.802 --> 01:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
or that somehow, they're
second-rate because of it.

01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:12.190 align:middle line:90%
On the contrary.

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this is
about liberating our

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.515 align:middle line:90%
set our conception of ability.

01:02:16.515 --> 01:02:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And being in "The
Element," I wrote that book

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:21.450 align:middle line:84%
because it's clear that people
have all kinds of talents

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and that there you have
great personal and social and

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.250 align:middle line:84%
cultural value, too, and we
should be cultivating them.

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:28.958 align:middle line:84%
But being good at
something isn't enough.

01:02:28.958 --> 01:02:31.458 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of people
who do things they're good at,

01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
really care for it.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's true in the sciences,
and the arts, and all the rest.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was very funny
once with a book editor

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:43.770 align:middle line:84%
who had previously been a
concert pianist who gave it up

01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.577 align:middle line:90%
because she didn't like it.

01:02:45.577 --> 01:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
She was doing it because
she had to be good at it.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And nobody had stopped to ask
her whether she wanted to do it

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.500 align:middle line:90%
or not.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And she really wanted
to be a book editor.

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
She loved the world of books,
and so she changed track

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.900 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, to be in your
element, you have

01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:00.020 align:middle line:84%
to not only be good at
something, you have to love it.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you love
something, then you'll

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:03.660 align:middle line:90%
never work again, as they say.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's important
to me, because when

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.975 align:middle line:84%
we talk about fulfillment
of an individual,

01:03:09.975 --> 01:03:11.850 align:middle line:84%
there's an important
difference, isn't there,

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:15.453 align:middle line:84%
between physical energy
and spiritual energy?

01:03:15.453 --> 01:03:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean spiritual
in the religious sense.

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:18.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't not.

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But I mean that sense of mature
in high spirits or low spirits.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And you can see the difference.

01:03:25.850 --> 01:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
If you do something
that you love to do,

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:34.230 align:middle line:84%
you can be physically
exhausted by it but buzzing.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:36.900 align:middle line:84%
You see people who run marathons
or they play sports games.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.520 align:middle line:84%
They're whacked
at the end of it,

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.010 align:middle line:84%
but they're exhilarated
by what they've done.

01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
If you do something
you don't care for,

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:48.190 align:middle line:84%
you can be physically fine,
but on the ground spiritually.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I know when I was working
at the universities,

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Terry always knew what I'd
been doing during the day.

01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:55.733 align:middle line:84%
I could tell with
her, too by the way.

01:03:55.733 --> 01:03:57.400 align:middle line:90%
But I'd come through the door.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And if I'd had a day of
meetings, and boards,

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and paperwork, I aged
about 20 years, she said.

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd be heading straight
to the drinks cabinet.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I had a spiritual
crisis in that sense.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But after I've been working with
students or hanging with people

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and running workshops
or projects,

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of ready to
party when I came in.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:20.953 align:middle line:90%
And it's true for all of us.

01:04:20.953 --> 01:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
If you do something
that you love to do,

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:23.700 align:middle line:90%
it gives you energy.

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:25.590 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the critical
ways you can tell.

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You look at other
people doing work.

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I see politicians
flying around the world.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think, how do
they stay upright?

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.800 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is they
get energy from it.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you do something you
love, it gives you energy.

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:36.217 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take it from you.

01:04:36.217 --> 01:04:37.320 align:middle line:90%
It feeds you.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It keeps charging
your batteries.

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's true of any
type of activity.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.910 align:middle line:90%
There are people who would--

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:47.452 align:middle line:84%
the thing that you love, other
people hate it and vise versa.

01:04:47.452 --> 01:04:48.660 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.920 align:middle line:90%
You think, how do you do that?

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I know people who look
at teachers and think,

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you would
get to work in the morning.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.500 align:middle line:90%
How do you motivate yourself?

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And teachers who live
for what they do.

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:04.095 align:middle line:84%
And not only teaching,
but certain age groups.

01:05:04.095 --> 01:05:07.620 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who live
for working with kindergarten

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and grown men and
women who would

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
run a mile in the
opposite direction

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
if they were faced with
15 kids under three.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:15.630 align:middle line:90%
These are monsters.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
to do with them.

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So finding that match
between talent and energy

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:25.170 align:middle line:84%
is a very important
part of our journey

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:26.250 align:middle line:90%
to personal fulfillment.

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
our communities need

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:29.367 align:middle line:90%
all of these things as well.

01:05:29.367 --> 01:05:31.617 align:middle line:84%
We need people to be fulfilling
these different roles.

01:05:31.617 --> 01:05:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
educational system that's

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
based on a narrow
view of ability,

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
on conformity in
that sense-- and I

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
don't mean social conformity,
and I'm not saying

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
we should all go on the
streets and riot all the time.

01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a nice
idea in principle,

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
but it is also really nice when
the trains turn up on time.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.260 align:middle line:90%
We know this to be true.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:53.485 align:middle line:84%
That's a different discussion
about social conformity.

01:05:53.485 --> 01:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
conformity that's built

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.238 align:middle line:90%
into our conception of ability.

01:05:58.238 --> 01:05:59.530 align:middle line:90%
So it's important to push that.

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's also important
to recognize that this

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:08.080 align:middle line:90%
is true of our life trajectory.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
When your dad says
be an accountant,

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
or when anybody's parents
says don't do this, do that.

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:15.430 align:middle line:90%
You won't get a job doing that.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.990 align:middle line:90%
You should do this instead.

01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They're standing these
days on very shaky ground,

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:20.300 align:middle line:90%
and it's true for two reasons.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that no life
goes that way, necessarily.

01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:25.300 align:middle line:90%
We all make our lives up.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.410 align:middle line:90%
They're all inventions.

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.760 align:middle line:90%
We all create them.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.213 align:middle line:84%
And if I've learned anything
from speaking to people,

01:06:30.213 --> 01:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
it's that most
people end up doing

01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:34.005 align:middle line:84%
something they never thought
of when they were in school.

01:06:34.005 --> 01:06:35.140 align:middle line:90%
I ask whole rooms for this.

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.015 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot of events.

01:06:36.015 --> 01:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And the other week, I was in
a room with about 5,000 people

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:39.265 align:middle line:90%
there.

01:06:39.265 --> 01:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them,
how many of you

01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
now are doing what
you thought you'd

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:42.780 align:middle line:90%
be doing when you were 15?

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:43.795 align:middle line:90%
Like, two hands go up.

01:06:43.795 --> 01:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're people
who might say,

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
well, I always wanted to
be a doctor, and I am one.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.502 align:middle line:84%
But even then, they
couldn't have anticipated

01:06:49.502 --> 01:06:51.460 align:middle line:84%
the work they've done,
the places they've been,

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.835 align:middle line:84%
the life they've actually had,
what their CV really looks

01:06:53.835 --> 01:06:54.860 align:middle line:90%
like.

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, life
is a constant process

01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.640 align:middle line:90%
of improvisation.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's a kind of dance of
the opportunity, and interest,

01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and circumstance, and
choices, and luck.

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, luck happens.

01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:09.868 align:middle line:90%
Serendipity happens.

01:07:09.868 --> 01:07:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Random things get
thrown into the mix

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:14.110 align:middle line:84%
that you just didn't
expect, good and bad.

01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And you deal with
that as best you can.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And along the way, you
compose a biography.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.632 align:middle line:90%
And all of them are improbable.

01:07:23.632 --> 01:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
As I say, you don't
get your resume

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:26.040 align:middle line:90%
with your birth certificate.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
You make this up
as you go along.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:29.402 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you try to make
it look like a plan

01:07:29.402 --> 01:07:31.100 align:middle line:84%
when you write in
to apply for a job,

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
because you don't want to
convey the chaos you're actually

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:35.230 align:middle line:90%
living through.

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So you try to impose
an order on it.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.870 align:middle line:90%
So what that's line?

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it about God
laughing at our plans?

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But that is, I think,
certainly true.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:48.820 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:54.067 align:middle line:84%
It was always true that people
who achieve great things

01:07:54.067 --> 01:07:56.650 align:middle line:84%
in life-- and I don't mean that
they have to be great forever,

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:58.733 align:middle line:84%
but live a life they become
content with and happy

01:07:58.733 --> 01:08:01.330 align:middle line:90%
they've lived--

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
not always, but very often
take the road less traveled

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and find themselves
on a path they hadn't

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.173 align:middle line:90%
anticipated when they set out.

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's why I did a book called
"Finding Your Element."

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about it there is
a quest, and it's a good word.

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Because a quest is a
journey of intention

01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:24.064 align:middle line:84%
but with no clear
sense of the path.

01:08:24.064 --> 01:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'll be
heading back, no doubt,

01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:31.069 align:middle line:84%
to your home in the next few
days, and that's not a quest.

01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:33.130 align:middle line:90%
You know where it is.

01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:35.680 align:middle line:84%
You'll be pretty amazed if you
didn't show up there ready.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you may get
delayed on the way,

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:38.797 align:middle line:84%
but it's not like
you're looking for it.

01:08:38.797 --> 01:08:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Just, it's a journey
you're going to take.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:45.163 align:middle line:84%
But a quest is one where you
set out in hope and expectation

01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
but you may not know
that you're going to find

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.160 align:middle line:90%
what you're looking for.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.260 align:middle line:84%
But your journey is
intentional, and you're

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
prepared to do what
it takes to get there.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.689 align:middle line:84%
It's the hero's journey
that we all end up taking.

01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:57.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's true anyway.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:08:58.859 align:middle line:90%
That was always true.

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think, given how
short and uncertain

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:08.319 align:middle line:84%
our lives are, then recognizing
that we have responsibilities

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:12.189 align:middle line:84%
for other people, that we want
to live responsible lives as

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:15.282 align:middle line:84%
well as adventurous ones,
we owe it to ourselves

01:09:15.282 --> 01:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
to live a life that
adds up to something.

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:19.228 align:middle line:84%
I did an event a while
ago with the Dalai Lama.

01:09:19.228 --> 01:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And he said something
to that effect.

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:23.410 align:middle line:90%


01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
As he said, "to be born
at all is a miracle.

01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:28.069 align:middle line:84%
So what you going to
do with your life?"

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:28.899 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:32.160 align:middle line:84%
The chance of you being
here are vanishingly small,

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.899 align:middle line:84%
and far fewer people
make it than don't.

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:38.207 align:middle line:84%
So we've got 80, 90 years with
a falling wind at the moment.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.540 align:middle line:90%
So what you going to do with it?

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.901 align:middle line:84%
And that's what "The
Element" books are about.

01:09:41.901 --> 01:09:43.359 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
reason just now

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:46.750 align:middle line:84%
which is the old certainties
are broken down for all of us.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
The idea that if you do well
at school, get a degree,

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and then follow a
sensible occupation,

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that will lead you in
due course to a pension

01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and a life of comfort
and three cruises a year

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:03.550 align:middle line:90%
is simply not true.

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a short-lived
fiction for a small group

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
of people in a particular
moment in our history.

01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:12.468 align:middle line:84%
Simply not true now, and
there were reasons for it.

01:10:12.468 --> 01:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that we are a 7
and 1/2 billion people heading

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:19.000 align:middle line:84%
for 10 billion, that we don't
know if the planet can sustain

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:19.960 align:middle line:90%
us as we live now.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.240 align:middle line:90%
The chances are it won't.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.730 align:middle line:84%
We have bigger issues to be
contending with right now

01:10:24.730 --> 01:10:25.790 align:middle line:90%
than that.

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, a lot of these
occupations are disappearing.

01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And the original
Industrial Revolution

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
has given way to a new one,
artificial intelligence.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a misconception,
but artificial intelligence

01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
will, in all probability,
wash away millions of jobs

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.357 align:middle line:84%
that we thought previously only
human beings could do, jobs

01:10:46.357 --> 01:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that the current educational
system is preoccupied

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.300 align:middle line:90%
with preparing people for.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that you'll have
a secure job as an accountant

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
is simply tenuous
at the very best.

01:10:56.930 --> 01:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So if people want to be
realistic about our career

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.640 align:middle line:84%
chances and the
lives we might lead,

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
that is part of what
I'm arguing for.

01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not arguing for a bigger
emphasis on creativity,

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and curiosity, and
diversity, because I

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
think these are fanciful,
romantic notions

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:13.070 align:middle line:90%
and want to be nice.

01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:15.278 align:middle line:84%
I think these are also
hard-headed economic arguments

01:11:15.278 --> 01:11:16.880 align:middle line:90%
now as well as social ones.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:19.190 align:middle line:84%
If we want people to
live a life of some kind

01:11:19.190 --> 01:11:23.735 align:middle line:84%
of economic security
and social stability,

01:11:23.735 --> 01:11:25.610 align:middle line:84%
we need to look at how
the world is shifting,

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's shifting
radically and quickly.

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And this education system
wasn't designed for this world.

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It's why we have to rethink
and go back to basics.

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a very
pragmatic argument now as well

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:40.100 align:middle line:84%
as a principled one to say that
we should put people in touch

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.020 align:middle line:84%
with their real
talents, and then

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.200 align:middle line:84%
let them make the life that
they are best able to make.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES: It's a
beautiful statement.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.773 align:middle line:84%
Then probably my
last question here

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:52.190 align:middle line:84%
as we wrap up, because you've
touched on all of the points

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:54.110 align:middle line:84%
that I've covered
here, is practically

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.940 align:middle line:90%
speaking, how do we do it?

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Do we meditate?

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Do we go out and do
more of what we love?

01:11:58.310 --> 01:12:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Do we find space for
the things that we love?

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:02.235 align:middle line:84%
What is a real, practical
application for somebody?

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Because in theory,
I get the concept.

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KEN: Yeah, which
is buy my books.

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:07.460 align:middle line:90%
It's all sorted at that point.

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.260 align:middle line:90%
Just do that.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:17.120 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Well, firstly,
people have often

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:21.023 align:middle line:84%
said to me that they
like my theories,

01:12:21.023 --> 01:12:22.190 align:middle line:90%
but what about the practice?

01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:24.307 align:middle line:84%
And I have a couple
of responses to that.

01:12:24.307 --> 01:12:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of them is
they're not theories,

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and they're not mine,
[LAUGHS] if they were.

01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:36.255 align:middle line:84%
I've worked in education
all my adult life.

01:12:36.255 --> 01:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't
something I've just kind

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.770 align:middle line:90%
of turned my attention to.

01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been sitting in
a library thinking about it.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with school
systems, schools, teachers, run

01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:49.370 align:middle line:84%
projects, traveled the
planet, worked in school

01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:51.630 align:middle line:90%
districts of every sort.

01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I've worked alongside
teachers, trained teachers,

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:59.043 align:middle line:84%
worked with kids groups,
taught in universities,

01:12:59.043 --> 01:13:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and thought about it, and
talked a lot of people about it,

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:02.770 align:middle line:90%
and seen a lot.

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm told about what works.

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
forms of education

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
which are rooted in our
best understanding of how

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:16.550 align:middle line:90%
people flourish.

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty clear to
say now a lot of people

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.080 align:middle line:90%
are not flourishing.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:28.270 align:middle line:10%
We're living in a time when one
of the most Sirius epidemics,

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:30.140 align:middle line:10%
one the most serious
threats to human health

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:34.520 align:middle line:10%
and well-being around
the world is depression.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Depression at a time when
we are materially better

01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:43.092 align:middle line:84%
off than at any time in
the history of our species.

01:13:43.092 --> 01:13:44.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're all better off.

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.500 align:middle line:84%
We're not all living
at the same level.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part, certainly
in the developed countries

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and in many of the
developing countries,

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:59.720 align:middle line:84%
a great majority of
people are living

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:04.340 align:middle line:84%
at a level of
material comfort that

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
was inconceivable at the
beginning of the Industrial

01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Revolution for the vast
majority people on the planet.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm think about mostly
my grandparents, who did not

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:19.520 align:middle line:84%
have the devices, the gadgets,
the access to the comforts,

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to electricity, to the
things that we simply

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.340 align:middle line:90%
take for granted.

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.400 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a time when
we've been materially better

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.930 align:middle line:90%
situated than we are now.

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I know that the
wealth gap is obscene.

01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I know that more and more
wealth is concentrated

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
in fewer and fewer hands, and
we face all kinds of perils

01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
as a consequence of that.

01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
for most people,

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.750 align:middle line:84%
the material challenges of
being alive on the planet

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and knowing what to eat when
are much lighter than they

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.910 align:middle line:90%
used to be.

01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But our spiritual lives
are a mess in most cases,

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and there are all kinds
of reasons for it.

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But people lack a
sense of well-being,

01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:59.300 align:middle line:90%
lack of sense of fulfillment.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, seems to be
one of the greatest challenges

01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:07.070 align:middle line:90%
that we currently face.

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And education isn't going to
be the answer to all of it,

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:12.600 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be part
of that solution.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.388 align:middle line:84%
So what I've been looking
at are the conditions

01:15:15.388 --> 01:15:16.430 align:middle line:90%
in which people flourish.

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are various
of them out there,

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and one is doing work that we
find satisfying, fulfilling,

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and we think has a value,
not just to ourselves,

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
but to other people that's
inherently interesting,

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:29.210 align:middle line:90%
and valuable, and worthwhile.

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Another is having some
sense of financial security,

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:34.670 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
personal wealth

01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:37.760 align:middle line:84%
or collective social
responsibility.

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.780 align:middle line:84%
One is having an overall
sense of purpose in our lives,

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:45.833 align:middle line:84%
that we have a reason to be
alive and to continue living.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And that often comes
from serving other people

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
serving ourselves.

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Another is having a sense
of physical well-being,

01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:58.440 align:middle line:90%
feeling physically fit.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, as
you know better than most,

01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
are living their
lives which are bathed

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:07.010 align:middle line:84%
in toxins of various sorts
and created a hostile chemical

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:09.930 align:middle line:90%
environment for ourselves.

01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So these aren't theories
in the sense of it's

01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:18.560 align:middle line:84%
a hypothesis I've been
kind of figuring out

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.440 align:middle line:90%
on some retreat somewhere.

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I have thought what I
think for a very long time.

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:26.240 align:middle line:90%
I keep challenging it.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.850 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen schools that
have transformed themselves.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:32.687 align:middle line:84%
I get messages from people,
I meet people at events.

01:16:32.687 --> 01:16:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I travel around the
world, and I see schools

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.650 align:middle line:90%
that have been transformed.

01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
People who come up,
whole districts.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:39.253 align:middle line:84%
And I was recently at a school
district where they said,

01:16:39.253 --> 01:16:42.230 align:middle line:84%
we will change
everything that we

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.780 align:middle line:84%
are doing now based
on stuff we have read

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:46.010 align:middle line:90%
that you've been promoting.

01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Not just me.

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm acting as a voice, I think,
for a lot of other people

01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:52.260 align:middle line:90%
in this respect.

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just for odd reasons,
I find myself in that position

01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.260 align:middle line:90%
and set out to do it.

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:01.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to
promote conditions

01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:05.570 align:middle line:84%
that I think are time-tested
under which people flourish.

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Not conditions
under which people

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:10.190 align:middle line:84%
can be guaranteed,
therefore, to get

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:13.400 align:middle line:84%
great academic qualifications,
get PhDs, and go off and do

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.900 align:middle line:90%
a postdoc someone.

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
conditions that we

01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:21.530 align:middle line:84%
know are conducive
to human well-being.

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, there is no
single way to do it.

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:26.780 align:middle line:84%
There are principles
on which to do it.

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:29.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't replace a standardized
system with another one.

01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
If we're serious
about diversity,

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:35.510 align:middle line:84%
there are a million
routes to success.

01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
But there are a couple
of core principles here.

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
One of them is that education
has to be personalized.

01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:46.670 align:middle line:84%
By that, I don't mean by people
sitting in front of a computer,

01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
going through like rats, as
a friend of mine once put it,

01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
"rats down a maze,
individualized."

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:55.730 align:middle line:10%
Education has to be
rooted in relationships.

01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It has to be one in which
the experiences that we offer

01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:01.940 align:middle line:84%
are a conduit to the
person we're dealing with.

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Medicine is becoming
more personalized.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.880 align:middle line:90%
I have a car outside.

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.245 align:middle line:84%
I've had it for a couple of
years now, quite a few years.

01:18:11.245 --> 01:18:12.620 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
unusual about it,

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
except it's probably the only
one of its type in the sense

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:18.620 align:middle line:90%
that it's an off-the-rack car.

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:21.350 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I tell them
all the triddles that I wanted,

01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
out of all the
choices they gave me,

01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
this color, that upholstery,
this sound system,

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.442 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff that's
in the catalog,

01:18:27.442 --> 01:18:29.650 align:middle line:84%
it turns out there are a
million versions of the car.

01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:31.612 align:middle line:90%
So you can customize your car.

01:18:31.612 --> 01:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
We ought about to
customize our education

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.452 align:middle line:90%
system to meet the needs.

01:18:34.452 --> 01:18:35.660 align:middle line:90%
So it should be personalized.

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.322 align:middle line:90%
It should be customized.

01:18:37.322 --> 01:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
to say about it

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.110 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a huge
amount of room for innovation

01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:45.350 align:middle line:90%
in the system as it is.

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of what goes on
in our school systems

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
is not the result
of legislation.

01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:54.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the result of
habit and ritual.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing anywhere,
really, in most of our systems

01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that requires that we
educate kids by age group.

01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:02.502 align:middle line:84%
We just do, because we think
you have to, but you don't.

01:19:02.502 --> 01:19:07.137 align:middle line:84%
And outside of schools, we
wouldn't think of doing that.

01:19:07.137 --> 01:19:08.720 align:middle line:84%
When kids leave
school at 3:00 o'clock

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.250 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon
or 4:00 o'clock,

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
we don't say, now, all
the four-year-olds,

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:13.938 align:middle line:90%
be sure to go over there.

01:19:13.938 --> 01:19:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Keep away from eight-year-olds.

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Bad things happen, we know.

01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Communities are
intergenerational.

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to divide
the data subjects.

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:26.090 align:middle line:90%
We just do.

01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:27.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.083 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of great
schools that don't do that

01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and having wonderful
success as a result.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.602 align:middle line:84%
So my answer is that we need
to look at the principals,

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and then we need to look at
examples of good practice

01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:40.460 align:middle line:84%
around the world and where
it's not only feasible,

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.897 align:middle line:90%
but it is already happening.

01:19:41.897 --> 01:19:42.980 align:middle line:90%
There is change happening.

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of whether we
can make it happen long enough.

01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:47.153 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think
of your own work,

01:19:47.153 --> 01:19:48.943 align:middle line:84%
you could look at
the food industry.

01:19:48.943 --> 01:19:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
well, they're

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:51.777 align:middle line:84%
throwing their
hands up about this

01:19:51.777 --> 01:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and say, how can you
possibly change this?

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact is, you can
if you give people a better

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
argument, if you open their
eyes to more profound principles

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.400 align:middle line:84%
of human welfare
and flourishing,

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
if you persuade them
in the right way

01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that this is a better way to
do things, and then show them

01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:11.300 align:middle line:84%
how it can be done, how
the people are doing it.

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
depend on people's goodwill

01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and their own determination to
do things better for themselves

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.050 align:middle line:90%
and the people they work with.

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
But then movements start to
happen, and they do happen.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.002 align:middle line:90%
And you can see it now.

01:20:24.002 --> 01:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in
the environmental

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
with Greta Thunberg
and the rest.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
One person becomes--
a dozen people

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
becomes several thousand,
and then you have a movement.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think if there's
the appetite for change,

01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:41.023 align:middle line:84%
and the impulse for change,
and I feel it happening,

01:20:41.023 --> 01:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
then the idea is right,
that the practices are there

01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:45.970 align:middle line:90%
to help make it a reality.

01:20:45.970 --> 01:20:47.150 align:middle line:90%

Ken, you're a gentleman,
scholar, and a force for good.

Appreciate your time so much.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.230 align:middle line:84%

sharing with us.

the right stuff?

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>>JAMES: We covered
so much great stuff.

01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:56.380 align:middle line:90%
Very happy.
