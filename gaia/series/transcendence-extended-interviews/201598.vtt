00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.340 align:middle line:10%


00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from Food Matters.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.810 align:middle line:10%
And today I'm with a dear
friend, Mike Sherbakov.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.220 align:middle line:10%
He is a former Marine.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.340 align:middle line:10%
He has studied kinesiology
and psychology.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
He is the founder of the
Greatness Foundation,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.010 align:middle line:84%
and also the meme
Do Great Things.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.057 align:middle line:84%
He is a force for
good on planet Earth.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited to
chat with him today

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:84%
about how conscious business
can shape the future of humanity

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and how you and I can play
a part in that future.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Mike.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> James, thanks for
having me, brother.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm excited to chat.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And like most
interviews, I'm really

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
interested in the personal
story behind the person

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and what it took to create you
and the work that you do today.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So was there an impetus that
sort of set you on this path

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:84%
towards sort of helping
philanthropic organizations,

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.190 align:middle line:84%
creating your own, doing
good work in the world,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
helping people find more
purpose and meaning?

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Or if there wasn't a
particular catalyst,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:84%
what was it just like
growing up in your life,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:90%
in your household?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I grew up with
very strict parents.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I was born in Russia.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
We moved to the States
when I was five years old.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And growing up in
my household, it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
was all about
following the rules.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.170 align:middle line:84%
My oldest sister
went to Stanford.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
My sister after that got her
doctorate in neuroscience.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of the
black sheep in the family.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I was the one that was
always asking questions.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.990 align:middle line:84%
At the time, my parents
would have thought

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and seen it as rebellious.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But now looking
back, it was really

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.692 align:middle line:84%
just me questioning, why are
we doing the things we do?

00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Why do we think the
things that we think?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Why do we-- that's a question
that always fascinated me.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Why do we do the things
we do in general?

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And so while
everyone in my family

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:84%
was on a certain path,
when I turned 18,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I decided to join
the Marines, which

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:90%
was totally outside the norm.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, no one in my friend
group, no one in my family,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
no one had any
military experience.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
It was just one of
those things that I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:90%
knew was the right path for me.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think when-- to answer
your question, that's really

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
the first time in the
hero's journey, I would say,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that there was this
separation, where there

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.125 align:middle line:84%
was a certain path I
was on and I realized,

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take a
different path, one

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:90%
that's entirely true to me.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And now that I look back,
it all starts to make sense

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:90%
and the dots connect.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I learned
really early in the Marines

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:84%
was, when I thought that I
had reached my potential,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
I was only a fraction
of the way there.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Where I felt like I couldn't
do a single push up more,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and there's 85 other people in
the platoon that are relying

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.542 align:middle line:84%
on me to do one more, I could
do one more, and then one more,

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and one more after that.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So it got me fascinated
with this idea of potential,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and why do we limit ourselves,
and later in my life realizing,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.365 align:middle line:84%
why do we limit the businesses
that we create with this glass

00:02:58.365 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:84%
ceiling of what we think
they're capable of, when they're

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
truly capable of a
lot more than that?

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So the natural transition
for me was after the Marines,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I needed to study it.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.678 align:middle line:84%
So I went and
studied kinesiology,

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
how the body works, because
I was fascinated with that.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And then psychology
is how the mind works.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
How do those things
integrate, and really,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:90%
why do we do the things we do?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I came back to that
question always,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.907 align:middle line:90%
questioning life in general.

00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:90%
You know, where do we come from?

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do what we do?

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And so never studying
entrepreneurship or business

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
or anything like that, after
I graduated from university,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.850 align:middle line:90%
I started to notice a pattern.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.580 align:middle line:84%
In the Marines, I had
understood my potential

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:90%
from a physical standpoint.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
In college, I started
to understand potential

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
from a mental
standpoint of, well,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I am capable of a lot more
than I think I'm capable of.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Then I started going into
yoga teacher training

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the
spiritual evolution

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and how much potential
there was there.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.497 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
my first business.

00:03:54.497 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
everything really clicked,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.030 align:middle line:84%
how it all came together
is I started to realize,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
as individuals, we are capable
of a certain amount of impact.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:84%
We can go out and
create great impact

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.390 align:middle line:84%
with our immediate family,
our friends, our community.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:90%
But that's limited.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I started to
realize how business

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.742 align:middle line:90%
can be this force for good.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
A huge catalyst
for me was actually

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:84%
reading "Start Something That
Matters" by Blake Mycoskie,

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.723 align:middle line:90%
who's the founder of Toms.

00:04:19.723 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I had
a business that

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.557 align:middle line:84%
was already running
and generating

00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
a good amount of revenue.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't have a
strong mission to it.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The mission at the time
was strictly revenue-based.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So after reading "Start
Something That Matters,"

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I ended up selling that
business and starting

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Karuna Towels, which
was a blend, for me,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:90%
of impact and income.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It was-- I had partnered with
the Against Malaria Foundation.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
were selling these yoga mats

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
that you would put
on top of yoga towels

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
that you put on
top of yoga mats.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.472 align:middle line:84%
And for every one
that we sold, we

00:04:53.472 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:84%
would provide a bed net
for a family in Africa.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:90%
So we do this one-for-one model.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was really my first
understanding or my first dip

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
into social entrepreneurship
and realizing how business

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:90%
can be a force for good.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of
the short version

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:90%
of about 10 years of my life.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So interesting
journey and foray.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I want to touch on

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned in particular
was this idea of separation.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I can really
empathize with that,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
because my journey began by
choosing something completely

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:90%
different, as well.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't that Marines.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:90%
I was a merchant seaman.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So I worked on ships--
container ships,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:90%
tankers, passenger ferries.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
I used to drive them,
was a navigator, and then

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:90%
private yachts.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And that took me
away from everything.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
completely isolated.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really
formative part of my journey.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain to me, what
was that separation like?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.922 align:middle line:84%
How did that help you sort of
identify some of these things

00:05:50.922 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that you wanted to
focus on in your life?

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And did that time in
that very different phase

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
of your life in the Marines
help you really develop

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what you
decided to work on today?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:90%
I want to go deep into that.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
I would say a common
question that I

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
get is, what made me join
the Marines at the time?

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And other than knowing that
that was what I needed to do,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.667 align:middle line:84%
I really don't have
a great answer to it.

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I remember walking in
the recruiter's office

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:84%
for the first time and they
have this recruiting tool

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
where they put out all these
placards in front of you.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And they each have
a word on them--

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
camaraderie, adventure,
challenge, brotherhood,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
patriotism, all of these
different qualities that you--

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
or experiences that one
might have in the Marines.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
recruiter saying, you know,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.300 align:middle line:84%
put them in the order that
it's most important to you.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.925 align:middle line:84%
And I remember looking
at all of them--

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:90%
there were probably 12 or 15--

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and said all of these
things are important to me

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:90%
right now in my life.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.600 align:middle line:84%
At 18 years old, it was
exactly what I was looking for.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And it just felt aligned with
what I knew I needed to do.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.038 align:middle line:84%
Again, my parents
didn't even know

00:07:04.038 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I was going to the recruiters
office at the time.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.310 align:middle line:90%
It was just, this is the path.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:90%
This what you need to do.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
This is what your
sisters have done.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
This is what our family's
done for generations.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:84%
You just-- you know,
you go to high school.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.120 align:middle line:90%
You go to college.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:90%
You get a good job.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.942 align:middle line:90%
And you stay in that job.

00:07:14.942 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:90%
And you retire.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.667 align:middle line:90%
And that was the path.

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm not
going to take that path.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally, looking at
these placards in front of me,

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I knew that that was-- that
was what I needed to do.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
joined, it was--

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
the skills I learned
from the experiences

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:84%
are invaluable-- leadership,
confidence, courage.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I grew up playing sports,
and so I felt comfortable

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:90%
in leadership roles.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But I generally would allow
other people to be leaders.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I would kind of silently
let them do their thing.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the Marines, it was
really this first opportunity

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
where I started to step
into the kind of leader

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:84%
that I always knew
I was capable of,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
but maybe a role that I didn't
consciously and intentionally

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:90%
step into.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think through
that experience,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I did really well
in the Marines.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I got meritoriously promoted
several times, which

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:90%
is very rare.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even in a
general Marines career,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
maybe one meritorious
promotion in 20 years

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:84%
is something that's a
really great accomplishment.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:90%
And I had several of those.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I set some records
through, you know,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
the physical, mental,
fitness areas.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that my
leadership and my courage

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
was developed through
that whole process.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's awesome.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.017 align:middle line:84%
That's cool that you
mentioned Blake, as well,

00:08:32.017 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
because I think he really
helped put conscious business

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:84%
on the road map for at least in
the more modern sense of, you

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:90%
know, one for one ideology.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got some
interesting theories

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.150 align:middle line:84%
on the history and the
evolution of conscious business,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
around these sort of four Ps
that we've spoken about before.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd love it if you
could share with me sort

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:84%
of what they are
and sort of if there

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
was any sort of
historical point in time

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that-- to give people some
reference of how that unfolded.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I found the evolution of
business to be fascinating,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
understanding that
business first was--

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
in understanding the primary
fundamentals of business,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
which is this voluntary exchange
between someone offering

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.027 align:middle line:84%
a product or service
and that person

00:09:14.027 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
receiving value from
that product or service

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.450 align:middle line:90%
and exchanging money for it.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So initially, the
point of business--

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:90%
what I call business 1.0--

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:90%
was just profit.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.967 align:middle line:84%
It was, I'm going to give
you this product or service.

00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And in exchange, I'm
going to receive money.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's really the
only thing I care about.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.212 align:middle line:84%
From a business owner, from a
business creation standpoint,

00:09:32.212 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and really what it comes
down to is the consciousness

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.962 align:middle line:84%
or the intention
behind the business.

00:09:35.962 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It was solely, how
can I generate income

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:90%
from what I'm creating.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a bad
thing, by any means.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's just what the
principles of capitalism

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.703 align:middle line:90%
are built upon.

00:09:46.703 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And then all the
sudden, we start moving

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.965 align:middle line:90%
into caring more about people.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't just people
within our organization.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But these are actually
the customers, as well.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.785 align:middle line:84%
So because with capitalism
it drives innovation--

00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:01.818 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.818 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
as long as someone
doesn't have a monopoly,

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.652 align:middle line:84%
it drives-- the prices
continue to kind of lower.

00:10:05.652 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
So it forces people to come up
with products and services that

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.910 align:middle line:84%
are better, and also
caring for people

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.703 align:middle line:84%
within their company
and their customers.

00:10:13.703 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden, we
move into this generation

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of business 2.0, which
is now not only profit,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.580 align:middle line:84%
but we're starting to care
about people, as well.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we fast forward
into around the time

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.130 align:middle line:84%
"An Inconvenient Truth"
came out and Al Gore's

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:90%
talking about climate change.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And people are just
more mindful of what's

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:90%
happening on a global scale.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And people start being
concerned about the planet.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.068 align:middle line:84%
They're worried about
wildlife conservation.

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
They're worried
about climate change.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.027 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to just be
aware of these things that are

00:10:39.027 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:90%
happening on a global level.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
So we move into business 3.0,
which is now including planet.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So we have what people call
triple bottom line, which

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
is you have your profit,
people, and planet-- or people

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:90%
say people, planet, profit.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And now it's an exciting
time in our lives

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.080 align:middle line:84%
because we're seeing a
shift into business 4.0.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's the fourth
P, which is purpose.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And we start to feel
it as individuals,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
we start to feel it
collectively, as well,

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking to not only
create businesses, but align

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
ourselves and be consumers
of businesses that

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:90%
have purpose tied into them.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So this rise of
conscious capitalism,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
this rise of the for-benefit
movement, this rise of not

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:84%
only being concerned about the
profits-- because the profits

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.060 align:middle line:84%
are the lifeblood of the
business, absolutely.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.053 align:middle line:84%
Not only taking care of your
employees and your consumers

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and customers that
you're serving.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Not only being
mindful of the type

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.810 align:middle line:84%
of impact we're
having on the planet,

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.095 align:middle line:84%
but also being aligned
with a purpose.

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
believe coming down

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:84%
to our individual purpose
is more important than ever,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:84%
because yes, can you take a
huge organization and a company

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and start to slowly move it more
into an alignment with purpose?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.812 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:46.812 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:84%
My sister is a wonderful
example of that.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.270 align:middle line:84%
She does consulting in
the for-benefits space.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
One of her clients
right now is Versace.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.880 align:middle line:84%
So you take this huge brand
and it's taking a long time

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to take a company
like that that wants

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.697 align:middle line:84%
to become for-benefit
and start to steer

00:12:01.697 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that ship in a slightly
different direction that's

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:90%
more aligned with purpose.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
The reason I'm so passionate
about entrepreneurship

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is because if we start
from inception being clear

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:84%
on our purpose, which
I really believe

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.750 align:middle line:84%
is the intersections of our
passions, our strengths,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:84%
and our connection to
the world, with all

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
the social and environmental
challenges our world is facing,

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.080 align:middle line:84%
which one do we feel
most connected to?

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So just like a seed,
it's a lot easier

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.768 align:middle line:84%
to focus on what that seed that
we're planting in the ground

00:12:26.768 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
is and then water it
and give it everything

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to
nurture and grow.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So much easier to
do that than to try

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.560 align:middle line:84%
to change this big huge tree
that's already been grown

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.563 align:middle line:90%
for years, or maybe decades.

00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I believe
it's ultimately so important

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
our purpose is,

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and then create something
meaningful from that, which

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
is one of the things that we
do at Greatness Foundation, why

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited and passionate
about this purpose-driven

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:90%
entrepreneurship.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell people,
start a business that

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:84%
matters as you move into this
new model of business 4.0.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:02.505 align:middle line:84%
How is this relevant
for individuals that

00:13:02.505 --> 00:13:03.630 align:middle line:90%
might not be entrepreneurs?

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I really
believe that we have--

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
we're inherently-- we
voted in a top down system.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:90%
We said no to feudalism.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:90%
We said no to communism.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:84%
We said no to
dictatorships, obviously.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, we sort of voted
in this idea of democracy.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And now we live in what we
refer to as this Western,

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Industrialized, Educated, Rich,
and Democratic society, which

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.910 align:middle line:90%
is a WEIRD acronym--

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:90%
literally.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.995 align:middle line:84%
In that framework,
it's not everybody

00:13:33.995 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that starts a
conscious business,

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
but people want
to effect change.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:90%
So can that happen?

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.217 align:middle line:84%
How can people sort of
find out or interact

00:13:41.217 --> 00:13:42.300 align:middle line:90%
with conscious businesses?

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And how can that be a landscape
for change in the world?

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:84%
As you mentioned,
I don't believe

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
everyone is designed
to be an entrepreneur.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The beautiful thing, though,
about asking the questions--

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I am a firm believer in
the quality of our life

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.470 align:middle line:84%
depends upon the quality of
the questions we ask ourselves.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.198 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that when someone
asks, what is my purpose?

00:14:02.198 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
am I passionate about?

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
am I great at?

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:84%
What do I feel a
connection to in the world?

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's down the path
of entrepreneurship,

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:84%
but maybe just by getting
clear on what your purpose is,

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:84%
you find an organization,
a company, a nonprofit,

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
some kind of entity that
aligns with those same values.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's really no better
answer than intuitively

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and energetically we feel that.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.375 align:middle line:84%
We know, for instance, when
someone walks in the room

00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and after a few
minutes of having

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:84%
a conversation with them, the
kind of energy that they carry,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.818 align:middle line:84%
we say things like, you
know, they've got good vibes.

00:14:31.818 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:90%
They've got bad vibes.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, we may not be
able to explain all of it.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we feel
these things, just

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:84%
like we do with
people and situations

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:90%
and experiences we're in.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we walk
down a dark alley.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:84%
We go, something
about this feels off.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Let me go this other way.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.510 align:middle line:84%
The same exact thing
happens with organizations

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and who we choose to
spend our time with

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and the kinds of things we
spend our time thinking about.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I think a really great
example of this is--

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend,
Dr. Jeremy Goldberg.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I remember doing a podcast
interview with him.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Mike, you're going
to suffer one way or another.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And by suffering,
he meant that you're

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
going to go through
challenges in life.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
In the hero's journey, we
would call this the initiation.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So he says you're exchanging
your time for something,

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
so why not suffer or exchange
your time for something that's

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:90%
meaningful to you.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.995 align:middle line:84%
And so the prerequisite
to doing something

00:15:21.995 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that's meaningful to
you is to realize,

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:90%
what is meaningful to me?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
do I care about?

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Do I care about
wildlife conservation?

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, do I care about
providing this kind of product

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:90%
or service to someone?

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:90%
And absolutely.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:84%
It may not be you
that's creating

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
that thing from the ground up.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But you'll align
with other people

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
who are doing the same things,
this being a great example.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
We start with a
conversation-- oh, wow,

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.527 align:middle line:84%
we're both passionate
about conscious capitalism,

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
about purpose-driven
entrepreneurship,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:90%
about creating a better world.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And so whether it's
mine or yours or ours,

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:51.970 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, we get
to come together

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and share resources that
are ultimately compounding.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:90%
1 plus 1 doesn't equal 2.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:84%
1 plus 1 equals 11
in this case, right?

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> That idea of synergy, right?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:84%
This understanding
essentially probably invited

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
you to start Greatness
Foundation, in a way,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.435 align:middle line:84%
and this ideology
of, do great things.

00:16:17.435 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what was the inception
of that, and some of the things

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.352 align:middle line:84%
that you do, because I know
you do a lot of great work.

00:16:22.352 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, personally you
do philanthropic work.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.263 align:middle line:84%
But then as part of
this organization,

00:16:26.263 --> 00:16:30.380 align:middle line:84%
you lead groups to go and do
work building houses or schools

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
How has this understanding
helped inspire that movement?

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it is the foundation
for the foundation.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is, I
was in a workshop about seven

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
years ago and they asked us
this very important question of,

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.540 align:middle line:84%
what would you do if you had
all of the money and the time

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:90%
in the world?

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You wake up tomorrow morning
and you have $100 million

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:84%
in your bank account and
you've got all the freedom.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.847 align:middle line:84%
After you-- if someone wants
to buy the things they want

00:16:58.847 --> 00:17:00.680 align:middle line:84%
to buy or go on the
trips they want to go on

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and then things
kind of slow down,

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:84%
how do you spend the
rest of your days?

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And the kinds of things
that came to mind,

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.932 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of things I
started writing down,

00:17:07.932 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:90%
was, well, I want to travel.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.685 align:middle line:90%
I want to give back.

00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to learn
as much as I can.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to surround myself
with amazing people.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.012 align:middle line:90%
I want to create content.

00:17:15.012 --> 00:17:16.290 align:middle line:90%
I want to teach.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.319 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I don't want to
wait until the end of my life

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:90%
to do all this.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the studies that
completely transformed my life

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.569 align:middle line:84%
was Dr. Bronnie Ware, the
Australian palliative care

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
nurse who studied patients
as they were dying.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And she realized that the number
one regret that everyone had

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:84%
across the board--
men, women, all ages--

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
was that they wish they'd
had the courage to live

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%
a life true to themselves,
not the life others

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:40.575 align:middle line:90%
expected of them.

00:17:40.575 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:90%
I took that to heart.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be
at the end of my life

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:84%
wishing I'd had the courage
to live a life true to myself.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in this workshop
and I realize, why don't I

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:90%
start doing that now?

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And right about
that same time, I

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
was actually invited on my first
house build project to Mexico.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been passionate
about impact and travel

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:90%
and making a difference.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.612 align:middle line:84%
So I go on this
weekend experience.

00:17:59.612 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
We build a home
from the ground up.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
The families prior
to us coming were

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.570 align:middle line:84%
living on dirt-- sticks for
walls, tarps for a roof.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm driving back in
the van on Sunday, Sunday

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
afternoon, I'm
crying my eyes out.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm having this incredibly
emotional experience.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I don't know
why I'm having the experience.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that I need
more of that in my life.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:90%
This was about seven years ago.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
So I come back to San Diego
and I just put a message out

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
on social media and I say, I
just had an amazing experience.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I want to go back and do this.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:90%
Does anyone want to join me?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And one person
raised their hand.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Two people raised their hand.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.452 align:middle line:90%
Three people raised their hand.

00:18:35.452 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And now here we are
seven years later

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
where this is a huge
milestone for us.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Just the other day, on
Monday afternoon, we

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.170 align:middle line:84%
put up a post opening
up a new project,

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:84%
because all our projects are
full for the rest of the year--

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.500 align:middle line:84%
in 36 hours raised $12,000 and
filled up the entire weekend.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and this just
speaks to the excitement

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:84%
that there is behind
making a difference.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.498 align:middle line:84%
So seven years ago, the
community starts building.

00:19:00.498 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I actually approach
business a bit backwards,

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.240 align:middle line:84%
because instead of offering
a product or a service

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and then sharing
it with a market,

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.072 align:middle line:84%
we created and built
a community first.

00:19:09.072 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I had these other businesses
that were running,

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
so I kind of had the freedom
to be able to do that of,

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.030 align:middle line:90%
build this community.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.245 align:middle line:84%
And then start to ask
them what it is they want.

00:19:17.245 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And the kinds of
things that came

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
to the surface and
the kinds of people--

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
the kind of things that people
said that they wanted were they

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.980 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know how
to start a business.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to start something
that matters to them.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
They wanted more
community events.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And so really,
Greatness Foundation

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:35.430 align:middle line:84%
has grown to become this-- what
we call an impact accelerator.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It's focused on life,
business, and impact.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So it has the personal
development side,

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
because I've seen that as
integral to any business.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Anytime I work with companies--
and I do work with lululemon,

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:84%
with Qualcomm, with Fitbit, with
some of these billion dollar

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:90%
brands.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm going in there
to work with their teams,

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
it always comes
down to individuals.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
It's individuals behind and
underneath the organizations.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we can change
their mindset,

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:84%
if we can understand
what their goals are,

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.630 align:middle line:84%
what their purpose
is, it ultimately

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:84%
steers the ship of the
larger organization.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So this personal development
we're deeply focused on.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
We launched a
business incubator,

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.500 align:middle line:84%
which now actually walks
people through step by step

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:84%
how to start
businesses that matter.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And then on the impact
side, we allow them

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:90%
to join us for these projects.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So we've been building homes
for the last seven years.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So we've done a lot
throughout Mexico.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
We helped open a
school in Nicaragua.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We're building a
children's home in Kenya.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're taking all this
and we have a deep focus now

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
on what we call the Do Great
Things project, which is

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:90%
educating high school students.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is a deep,
deep passion of mine,

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.017 align:middle line:84%
because I realize all of these
things we've been teaching

00:20:40.017 --> 00:20:42.350 align:middle line:84%
to our community over the
years on personal development,

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.308 align:middle line:84%
on business development,
how to make an impact,

00:20:44.308 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:90%
mindfulness entrepreneurship--

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
I start to think of, what if
I learned that in high school?

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
These are the classes
that I wish I had.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.923 align:middle line:84%
So our amazing impact
and community director

00:20:53.923 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
within Greatness Foundation
came up with this idea--

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%
I can't take credit for it--

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
but said, why don't we take
everything we've been teaching,

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
boil it down into an
easy-to-understand curriculum,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.367 align:middle line:84%
and start to teach
it to high schools--

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:84%
high school students
all across the country,

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
and eventually around
the world, and offer

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.173 align:middle line:90%
them different incentives.

00:21:09.173 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Teach them about the UN
sustainable development goals

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and how to create
projects and missions

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.932 align:middle line:90%
that are aligned with that.

00:21:14.932 --> 00:21:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really
exciting thing for me.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're doing
and deeply committed to

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:90%
at Greatness Foundation.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Do great things, man.

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Do great things.

00:21:23.425 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Do great things.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:90%
That's really inspiring.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
where you've created

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
a really good intersection
between meaning and business

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
is wrapping it in this
philanthropic idea, you know,

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and really bringing
light to the fact

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.923 align:middle line:90%
that it feels good to give back.

00:21:45.923 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Can I touch on the schooling
thing for a little bit?

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Please.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We created a schooling
system in the Victorian era

00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate our capability
to put graduates from those

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:84%
particular ideologies
into industrial age--

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
or into an industrial
age workforce.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.770 align:middle line:84%
We're using a very similar
system now, 253, 300 years on,

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're not saying, I believe,
great success with that,

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
merely by looking at the markets
for happiness in our society.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.180 align:middle line:84%
We have over 100
million prescriptions

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
written for anti-depressants
annually in the US,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and about 22 million people
taking SSRI antidepressants

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.360 align:middle line:90%
daily.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So something is wrong
with our culture,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
with our culture
scape, with the way

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.205 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing things as
modern, domesticated humans.

00:22:41.205 --> 00:22:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you think our schooling
system is part of the problem?

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.997 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
the big failings

00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
of our modern
schooling system are?

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Our current schooling system
is spitting out people

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
to be ready for
industrial era jobs

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's not going
to solve the problem.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
What is the big challenges with
our current education model?

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The biggest challenge with
our current education model is

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that it's an archaic
and old system.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's not taking
into consideration

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:11.085 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of things that people
are actually passionate about.

00:23:11.085 --> 00:23:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'll elaborate
on that a little bit.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:15.730 align:middle line:90%
The school bell rings.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The children get up out of their
seats and they go to lunch.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:84%
The school bell rings
again and they leave lunch

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and they come back and
sit down in their desks.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:90%
And they follow the rules.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And they memorize what's
needed to be memorized.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're taught,
essentially, to be robots.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
society as a whole,

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:84%
look at how someone operates
Monday through Friday.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Wake up to an alarm clock.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:90%
They sit in their car.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:90%
They drive to a job.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And not to sound insensitive to
anyone in any job that they do,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:84%
but they're essentially trained
like a monkey or a robot

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to simply push
whatever buttons or say

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
whatever you need to
say for x amount of time

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back in
your car and you go home

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:52.335 align:middle line:84%
and you kind of do the
same thing over again.

00:23:52.335 --> 00:23:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we've evolved
past factory jobs,

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.430 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
original school was designed

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.847 align:middle line:84%
to do-- follow the bell, work
at the factory, go to lunch,

00:23:58.847 --> 00:23:59.647 align:middle line:90%
come back.

00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But we're essentially
doing the same things.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're becoming very robotic
in everything that we do.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.692 align:middle line:84%
You look at someone's
Monday through Friday

00:24:05.692 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:90%
and it's very robotic.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately--
and fortunately--

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:84%
people are realizing that
this isn't what life's about.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.033 align:middle line:84%
Life is not about going to
work, paying bills, and dying.

00:24:18.033 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And people are starting
to wake up to the fact

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:23.610 align:middle line:84%
that there's so much more
to life than just this job

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for retirement
at the end of the road.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:26.853 align:middle line:90%
So what does that require?

00:24:26.853 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
It requires an
entire overhaul of

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:90%
our current educational system.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not about becoming a robot
and memorizing and following

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
the rules and listening
to a bell schedule.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It's actually about problem
solving and creative thinking.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.955 align:middle line:84%
And so why is it that
when I was growing up,

00:24:40.955 --> 00:24:42.830 align:middle line:84%
we never learned about,
what is your purpose?

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.970 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things are
you passionate about?

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to pursue?

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't I have
any choice in that?

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.605 align:middle line:84%
Why did I have to
sit in this classroom

00:24:50.605 --> 00:24:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and follow a certain curriculum
that someone else decided

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:53.940 align:middle line:90%
was important to me?

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And this comes back to
my always questioning.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I questioned that in
high school all the time.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I followed the rules because
that's kind of what I did.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But I was always
questioning, why?

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this?

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And so what I love seeing is
that there's this new model

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:90%
of education being born.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:84%
There's wonderful schools
here in San Diego.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.453 align:middle line:90%
We have one called SOUL School--

00:25:13.453 --> 00:25:16.632 align:middle line:84%
School Of Universal Learning--
where at a very early age

00:25:16.632 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:84%
they're asking them,
what kinds of things

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:90%
are you passionate about?

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Of all the problems that
you see in the world,

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:84%
how could you see yourself
solving one of those problems?

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.143 align:middle line:84%
They're teaching them
about entrepreneurship

00:25:25.143 --> 00:25:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and intrepreneurship and
interpersonal communication.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know, beyond even
the kinds of things we do,

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
to rewind and think

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:90%
about how we're being.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I really believe in this
model of be, do, give.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.690 align:middle line:84%
There's a framework
that some people

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:90%
teach that's be, do, have.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a fan of that.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I've played
the game of having.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.330 align:middle line:90%
I've climbed that mountain.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's the least fulfilling.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's the least
purposeful journey

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I've ever been on is
focused on what I have.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I started to realize
that greatness in our lives

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
is not about what we
have but what we give,

00:25:59.010 --> 00:25:59.997 align:middle line:90%
my entire life changed.

00:25:59.997 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we start to plant
that seed a little bit earlier?

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Imagine teaching kids at
a very young age, what

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.348 align:middle line:90%
if we started to give more?

00:26:06.348 --> 00:26:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a
cultural thing, even

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:09.815 align:middle line:84%
beyond just our
educational model

00:26:09.815 --> 00:26:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and the curriculum
that we teach.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But what if on our birthdays--
this is one thing I love to do.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:90%
I have a 14-year-old son.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Instead of gifts, what
if you thought about ways

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.220 align:middle line:90%
you can give?

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
What if on holidays we weren't
excited about the things

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that we were getting, but we
were excited about ways that we

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:90%
can give to other people.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it comes
down to just a radical shift

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.625 align:middle line:84%
collectively, culturally,
in our mindset of,

00:26:30.625 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:84%
it's not about the
things that we have.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all
on the same page.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
We realize it's not
about what we have.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:84%
How can we start to collectively
understand that life

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.700 align:middle line:90%
is about what we give?

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Dude, that was really good.

00:26:44.605 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:90%
That was really good.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.280 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm inspired deeply.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:90%
One of the things you talk to--

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's part of this sort
of educational program,

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.627 align:middle line:84%
and also part of
helping people identify

00:26:56.627 --> 00:26:58.710 align:middle line:84%
purpose, which I think is
an important discussion,

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:84%
because people
need some framework

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and massaging in order
to sort of develop

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.860 align:middle line:90%
what their purpose might be.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.567 align:middle line:84%
And even though that
might change, that's OK.

00:27:10.567 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:84%
You've got this framework
which is based on what are you

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.358 align:middle line:84%
passionate about,
and I don't think

00:27:14.358 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:84%
people take the time to really
think about that very often.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Or-- and I'm not sure if
you want to speak to this--

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
what we're passionate about
may be conditioned onto us

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.382 align:middle line:90%
or into us by our parenting.

00:27:26.382 --> 00:27:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And I want to just talk to
something here and let you

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:31.050 align:middle line:84%
jam on it if you
think it's relevant.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.050 align:middle line:84%
When we're growing up, we have
all these parts of who we are.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And Artie Wu, this
particular psychotherapist,

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
has a fantastic way
of referencing it.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.640 align:middle line:84%
He says, we have a board
of directors inside of us.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's like our
soul board, right?

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And one might be
really artistic.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.010 align:middle line:84%
One might be really
childish and creative,

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.256 align:middle line:90%
like me out on the surf.

00:27:49.256 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
One might be really determined
and business-centric

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:90%
and really by the numbers.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:90%
And another one might be this.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But then as we grow
up, our parents

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.462 align:middle line:84%
are loving to us in ways
that are conditional.

00:27:59.462 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:84%
We're all familiar
with conditional love.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.340 align:middle line:84%
You get good grades,
I'll love you.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
You get good grades,
I'll get you this.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And so we start to lock up
some of these board members

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.420 align:middle line:90%
that we have a relationship to.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Like, maybe it's the artist.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.990 align:middle line:84%
We've got to lock that bad
boy away for a few years,

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:middle line:84%
because that's not
where I'm getting

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.120 align:middle line:90%
rewarded for love in my home.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.680 align:middle line:90%
And then we hit out--

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and we strengthen our
other board members

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and we go and do the business
thing and we go do that.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
sort of not happy.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.138 align:middle line:90%
We're like, oh, that's right.

00:28:26.138 --> 00:28:27.127 align:middle line:90%
I love classical music.

00:28:27.127 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I forgot about that.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Or I love aqua or I love
watercolor painting,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.540 align:middle line:84%
or I love language
and philosophy.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And so later on
in life, we start

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to figure those out again
and sort of reestablish

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:90%
our connection to them.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So what I wanted to ask you
is, when you're guiding people

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.340 align:middle line:84%
or businesses-- but let's
maybe center it on people--

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.370 align:middle line:84%
through a process of discovering
their purpose in a deeper

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
way, shape, or form,
and you say to them,

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:90%
what are you passionate about?

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:53.820 align:middle line:84%
How do you really get to the
bottom of that for people

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and sort of skip over
the superficialities of,

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.822 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm passionate about, you
know, consulting with companies

00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and helping them break through
profit barriers or whatever.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.880 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hang on,
that's your brain talking.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.422 align:middle line:84%
What are you really
passionate about?

00:29:05.422 --> 00:29:07.868 align:middle line:84%
Actually, like, I'm passionate
about helping foster kids.

00:29:07.868 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
How do you break through
that, and is there

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:84%
a process around
helping people identify

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.110 align:middle line:84%
more deeply with their
intersection of finding

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.550 align:middle line:90%
this purpose.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Finding your purpose
comes down to two things.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.840 align:middle line:84%
The first one is dropping
from the head into the heart.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to do
that is through meditation

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and mindfulness and actually
taking the time to be quiet

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:90%
and to listen.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And the second one is
asking the right questions.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier that
the quality of our life

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.898 align:middle line:84%
depends upon the quality of
the questions we ask ourselves.

00:29:42.898 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So if asking, what are
you passionate about,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.850 align:middle line:84%
doesn't resonate with you, there
are so many deeper questions

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:48.810 align:middle line:90%
we can ask.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.000 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of
things do you enjoy?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.920 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
are you curious about?

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
are you interested in?

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.310 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
did you like as a child,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.770 align:middle line:84%
do you remember really
enjoying as a child,

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:00.980 align:middle line:84%
that you maybe haven't
even thought about,

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.900 align:middle line:84%
like playing the guitar
or the piano or singing?

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
bring you joy?

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.230 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
makes you come alive?

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.510 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things, when
you think about doing,

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.400 align:middle line:90%
make you smile?

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these
kinds of questions,

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.780 align:middle line:90%
if we just start asking them--

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.085 align:middle line:84%
I'm a huge fan of Marcus
Aurelius, the famous Roman

00:30:19.085 --> 00:30:20.085 align:middle line:90%
emperor and philosopher.

00:30:20.085 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And he says, the
soul becomes dyed

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:90%
with the color of its thoughts.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So what kinds of things
are we thinking about?

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always thinking about,
what am I passionate about?

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.023 align:middle line:90%
What makes me come alive?

00:30:30.023 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Howard Thurman says, don't
ask what the world needs.

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Ask what it is that
makes you come alive,

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
because what the world needs
is people who have come alive.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not about arriving
at the answer right away.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It's about asking
better questions.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And so passions are--

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.500 align:middle line:84%
it can be so many
different things.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
with your strengths.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.910 align:middle line:84%
As we find that intersection
of passions, strengths,

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and our connection to
the world, strengths

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.230 align:middle line:84%
can be seen the exact same
way, as what kinds of things

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.083 align:middle line:90%
are you good at?

00:30:56.083 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of
things would you say

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.770 align:middle line:90%
are your God-given abilities?

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.323 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of things
are people telling you

00:31:01.323 --> 00:31:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that you're good at that
you may not even recognize,

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.267 align:middle line:84%
that people can
always be saying, wow,

00:31:05.267 --> 00:31:06.600 align:middle line:90%
you're such an amazing listener.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.290 align:middle line:90%
You're an amazing listener.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.540 align:middle line:84%
But it never really
registers until you take

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.860 align:middle line:90%
the time to think about it.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, coming down to
this practice of meditation,

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:84%
mindfulness, yoga,
whatever that is,

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:84%
it's time to be alone
with our thoughts.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.470 align:middle line:84%
I think as a society, we're
constantly conditioned

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:90%
to chase the next thing.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And take it from me,
this goal-oriented

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.515 align:middle line:90%
achievement-driven person--

00:31:28.515 --> 00:31:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and I call myself a
recovering perfectionist,

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.320 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as I hit one
goal, I'm setting the next one.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.237 align:middle line:90%
And I'm onto the next.

00:31:33.237 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
This is why when yoga
came into my life,

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.900 align:middle line:84%
it completely
transformed my life,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.780 align:middle line:84%
because for the first time,
I was forcing myself to just

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:90%
be with myself.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.940 align:middle line:84%
I used to be really
uncomfortable

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.820 align:middle line:84%
even taking myself to the movies
or taking myself to dinner.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I do that all the time.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm an INTJ at heart.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I love my
time by myself.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So I think what it comes
down to fundamentally

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.990 align:middle line:84%
is for the individual to
spend time with themselves.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful
thing about this

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:84%
is it removes any
of the conditioning.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
It removes any of the
board of directors

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:90%
that maybe have been shut down.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:84%
It allows everyone
to come to the party

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and play the game because
when you're by yourself,

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:14.980 align:middle line:84%
there's no one else telling you
what the answers need to be.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.740 align:middle line:84%
So I often do this exercise for
individuals and organizations.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And I ask them,
what kinds of things

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.780 align:middle line:90%
are they passionate about?

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, let's
play pretend for a second.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's play pretend that
those things aren't just

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:90%
a coincidence.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the beautiful
thing about life

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:84%
is not only are we destined
for something great,

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.980 align:middle line:84%
not only are we
here to do something

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:84%
incredible with our lives, but
we're also given the blueprint

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.130 align:middle line:90%
on how to do it.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.540 align:middle line:90%
That's the beautiful part.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you get quiet
enough and you ask yourself,

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:43.980 align:middle line:90%
what are you passionate about?

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And really ask yourself
and just sit with it.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.112 align:middle line:84%
This is it right
now in this moment.

00:32:50.112 --> 00:32:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And what kinds of
things are you good at.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:52.825 align:middle line:90%
And really sit with it.

00:32:52.825 --> 00:32:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this is
right now in this moment.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.150 align:middle line:90%
That's not anyone else.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:90%
That's not your parents.

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:57.950 align:middle line:90%
That's not society.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.670 align:middle line:84%
That's not anyone else telling
you what you need to do

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.337 align:middle line:84%
or what you need to
be passionate about.

00:33:02.337 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So you get to take
that as an individual

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and follow that
as your blueprint.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I say,
let's play pretend,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:84%
even if this sounds
crazy to you,

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.540 align:middle line:84%
even though it
sounds so out there,

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.832 align:middle line:84%
just try it on for a minute
that the things that you're

00:33:12.832 --> 00:33:14.873 align:middle line:84%
passionate about, the
things that you're good at,

00:33:14.873 --> 00:33:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and the connection you
feel to the world--

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.300 align:middle line:84%
the thing that you want
to change in some way

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.340 align:middle line:90%
or fix or have an impact with--

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.170 align:middle line:84%
pretend like that
isn't a coincidence

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's an actual
blueprint for you to follow.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.083 align:middle line:90%
So it gives life meaning.

00:33:27.083 --> 00:33:28.000 align:middle line:90%
It gives life purpose.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.493 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a north star that
we continue to move towards.

00:33:30.493 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
great feeling,

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.600 align:middle line:84%
because it just comes
down to progress then.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
We spoke about school
and education earlier.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.153 align:middle line:84%
School and education
is someone else

00:33:39.153 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:84%
putting a north star for
us and saying, follow this.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:90%
This is your path.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Finding your purpose
is deciding what

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.750 align:middle line:84%
your path and making
progress in that direction.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Tony Robbins says,
progress equals happiness.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But what he forgot
to say is progress

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.200 align:middle line:84%
in the area that's
most meaningful to

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.520 align:middle line:90%
you equals happiness.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.103 align:middle line:84%
If we make progress on
a path that's not ours,

00:33:57.103 --> 00:33:58.270 align:middle line:90%
that's not meaningful to us.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.070 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I've been on that path, doing
what's not meaningful to me.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
individually decide

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.180 align:middle line:84%
what it is that's
meaningful to us,

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.540 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully create
something-- with business

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:84%
or maybe be involved with an
organization or something that

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.159 align:middle line:84%
can scale that kind
of impact that's

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:14.710 align:middle line:90%
aligned with our purpose.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Magical.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:16.830 align:middle line:90%
I love how you put it.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.330 align:middle line:90%
You make it sound simple.

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.436 align:middle line:90%
>> It is simple.

00:34:19.436 --> 00:34:19.780 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.789 align:middle line:90%
It's simple, but it's not easy.

00:34:20.789 --> 00:34:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm empathizing with you
deeply, going yes, I agree.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And I really reflect on
my journey in many ways.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, in 2006,
2007, you know,

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:36.179 align:middle line:84%
I remember being on
this private yacht.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:38.219 align:middle line:84%
We were driving
through the Red Sea.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.130 align:middle line:84%
It was three days after an
attempted piracy boarding.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a pretty
crazy area of the world,

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.719 align:middle line:84%
and handing out resignation
in and then getting

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:50.310 align:middle line:84%
to Monte Carlo, ordering some
film equipment from BNH New

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:52.940 align:middle line:84%
York and starting-- interviewing
people that we loved.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, and it was just
such an awesome thing to do.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.170 align:middle line:84%
We felt so driven
and just enlightened

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.200 align:middle line:90%
by the whole process.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's guided us ever since.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a lot to be said

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:90%
for following your passion.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
stories of people--

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:08.280 align:middle line:90%
short of your own, of course--

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that have gone through this
transformative process,

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.250 align:middle line:84%
or that you've seen
just have a new part

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:16.860 align:middle line:90%
of them awoken through this--

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.170 align:middle line:84%
through engaging
in deepening what

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.900 align:middle line:84%
it means to live a
more purposeful life,

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.287 align:middle line:84%
or even in the process
of giving back?

00:35:24.287 --> 00:35:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Are there people that stand out?

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Any stories that stand
out that you're like--

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.640 align:middle line:90%
that you like sharing?

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The honest answer
is, right now,

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.170 align:middle line:84%
everyone in my life
is that example.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And my goal-- one of
the goals I have is

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:41.740 align:middle line:84%
is to share more
of those stories,

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that's why I
do the Do Great Things podcast.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It's why I have the kinds of
conversations that I have,

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:48.130 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.547 align:middle line:84%
and share them as often as
possible-- because what it does

00:35:50.547 --> 00:35:55.210 align:middle line:84%
is it provides a possibility
to someone, someone that's

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:84%
going through the
hamster wheel, someone

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that's on the path that's
not meant for them.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
When they see someone
else who has separated,

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.220 align:middle line:84%
who has gone on their own
hero's journey, hopefully

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.810 align:middle line:84%
all of the sudden it shows
them now that's possible.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And everyone has a different
story that they connect with.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- let's
say that they've

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:16.452 align:middle line:84%
been in the military--
can connect with my story.

00:36:16.452 --> 00:36:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And they go, oh, I
was a Marine, too.

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:19.302 align:middle line:90%
And I thought I had to stay in.

00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But now I have this
different path I can take.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Someone else might connect
with a musician that's

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:84%
heard the story
of them following

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:84%
their passion for music
and art and creating

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.390 align:middle line:84%
a life and a
business around that.

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And so at this point in
my life, I intentionally

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:39.195 align:middle line:84%
surround myself with people who
are amazing examples of that.

00:36:39.195 --> 00:36:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm constantly
telling them--

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly inspired and in
awe of the people in my life.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And so there's no shortage
of examples in the world.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just the kinds of things
that we're looking for.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You're an amazing
example of that,

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.390 align:middle line:84%
what's being created
by people who

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.820 align:middle line:84%
are in alignment with their
purpose and their passion.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I think more of those
stories need to be shared.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.310 align:middle line:90%
Agree.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to help invoke
more recruits to the cause

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:09.690 align:middle line:84%
of living a purpose-driven life
and improving the quality of--

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.100 align:middle line:84%
or our capability to
stay even on this planet

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.500 align:middle line:90%
for a little longer.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.530 align:middle line:84%
You spoke and you keep speaking
about Joseph Campbell's

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.760 align:middle line:90%
work and the hero's journey.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.420 align:middle line:84%
To me, I love this, especially
from a filmmaker's perspective,

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.160 align:middle line:90%
especially as a storyteller.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.200 align:middle line:84%
My sort of role in the
world is to help give light

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.140 align:middle line:84%
to stories that can improve
the quality of the fabric

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.150 align:middle line:90%
of society that we have.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.065 align:middle line:84%
And you've mentioned
this multiple times.

00:37:36.065 --> 00:37:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And I'm glad you did.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain to
me in your words

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:41.080 align:middle line:84%
this sort of idea of
the hero's journey

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and how people
could connect with--

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:84%
connect with that, because they
might think, oh, I'm a failure.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.358 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm not ready yet.

00:37:49.358 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you connect
to the hero's journey,

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.260 align:middle line:84%
you're like, oh wow,
I'm just here right now.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Or I'm out here.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Or I've separated.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Or I've made this
amazing discovery.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So what is the hero's journey
and how can people relate

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.190 align:middle line:90%
to that in their own lives?

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so the hero's journey
is this famous narrative that

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.652 align:middle line:90%
really applies to all of us.

00:38:06.652 --> 00:38:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And there are three main
parts of the hero's journey.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a separation,
initiation, and a return.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing
about the hero's journey

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.080 align:middle line:90%
is it's cyclical.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.140 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
happens on macro cycles.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And it happens on micro cycles.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's not at one point we've
just reached it and we're done

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:90%
and we've finished.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.380 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we're
always moving through.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And so here are a
couple interesting parts

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:84%
of the hero's journey that I
feel that we, as individuals,

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.880 align:middle line:84%
can relate to being somewhere
on the journey at any given

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.680 align:middle line:90%
point in our lives.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
happens is we're on a path--

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.570 align:middle line:84%
a path that maybe
someone else decided

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.940 align:middle line:84%
was ours to take--
parents, society, school,

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.032 align:middle line:90%
whatever we decide.

00:38:44.032 --> 00:38:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And we realize we're meant
to be on a different path.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.173 align:middle line:84%
And so when we first realize
we're meant to be on a path,

00:38:49.173 --> 00:38:50.590 align:middle line:84%
this is what Joseph
Campbell would

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.890 align:middle line:84%
call the CTA, the Call To
Action or the Call To Adventure.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:84%
He would say that
the phone is ringing.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating about
this part of the hero's journey

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.230 align:middle line:84%
is most people don't pick
up the phone right away.

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.840 align:middle line:84%
This is where it actually
gets a little bit sad,

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.570 align:middle line:84%
because some people will wait an
entire lifetime not picking up

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:09.370 align:middle line:90%
the phone.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:11.580 align:middle line:84%
They'll hear the phone ringing
but they won't pick it up.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And those are the people that
are on their deathbed saying,

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:16.335 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd had the courage to
live a life true to myself.

00:39:16.335 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:84%
What they're saying is,
I wish I had the courage

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.990 align:middle line:90%
to pick up the phone.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So when we do pick
up the phone and we

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.350 align:middle line:84%
answer that CTA,
that Call To Action

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:84%
or Call To Adventure,
Joseph Campbell would say,

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:84%
we cross the threshold and we've
officially made the separation.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And we move from the first
part into the second part,

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.412 align:middle line:90%
which is now the initiation.

00:39:34.412 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we're
going through the fire.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.840 align:middle line:90%
We start to meet allies.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We start to connect with other
people who share our values,

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:84%
the people who stand for
the same kind of things

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.905 align:middle line:84%
we stand for, the
people who believe in us

00:39:45.905 --> 00:39:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and that we believe in, the
people that are inspiring us,

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:84%
the people that we want
along this journey, that we

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.380 align:middle line:90%
want on this ride with us.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
start to fight our dragons.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And dragons can
be family members

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.757 align:middle line:90%
that don't believe in us.

00:39:59.757 --> 00:40:01.840 align:middle line:84%
They can be friends that
we've had for a long time

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.210 align:middle line:84%
that we think we need to
stay friends with just

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.460 align:middle line:90%
because that's been so long.

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.920 align:middle line:84%
It can be our own
personal beliefs

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that we've had about ourselves
for a long time, to include,

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.180 align:middle line:90%
I am not enough.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Here I go again.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Who am I to be doing this?

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:84%
All the self-doubt that
creeps in our minds--

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.050 align:middle line:90%
those are the dragons.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's external
or internal dragons

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.530 align:middle line:84%
that we fight going
through the fire.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And we all have to
experience that.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we're done
going through this fire,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:90%
that's not the end.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we've
gone into the abyss.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:90%
We've discovered our gifts.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.880 align:middle line:90%
And end of story.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.387 align:middle line:90%
No, now is the return.

00:40:35.387 --> 00:40:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is the beautiful
part about the hero's journey,

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.992 align:middle line:84%
because we've gone
separation, initiation.

00:40:39.992 --> 00:40:41.200 align:middle line:90%
Now it's time for the return.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.900 align:middle line:84%
It's actually time to take
the gifts that you found

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.577 align:middle line:84%
about yourself, about
what your purpose is,

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:48.160 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
here to do, and it's

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.720 align:middle line:90%
time to bring them to the world.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not about going
to the top of an ashram

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:84%
off into a mountain somewhere
and meditating there

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.360 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:84%
If that's your hero's
journey, then great.

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But for most of us
it's about finding

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.060 align:middle line:84%
what our gifts are,
finding how they're

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.280 align:middle line:84%
impacting humanity's
civilization, culture,

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.640 align:middle line:90%
other people.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And again, this model of be,
do, have-- be, do, give--

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000 align:middle line:84%
it's about finding what
it is we're here to give

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing
that to the world.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So the return is
the exciting part,

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.642 align:middle line:84%
because we actually
get to take those gifts

00:41:14.642 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and now share them
with the world.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So here is this famous
narrative that we

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.890 align:middle line:84%
can see applied
across the movies

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:24.880 align:middle line:84%
that we watch, the books that
we read, and also in our lives.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.582 align:middle line:84%
And what I found by
interviewing amazing people who

00:41:27.582 --> 00:41:30.040 align:middle line:84%
are doing great things in the
world, what I found by having

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.590 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of
conversations is, everyone

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:84%
who is doing something
great in the world

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:36.700 align:middle line:84%
has a hero's journey that
they've been through.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of them has had
a point where they separated.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.325 align:middle line:90%
They were on a certain path.

00:41:41.325 --> 00:41:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And they knew they needed
to take a different path.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:45.940 align:middle line:84%
They answered the call to
action or call to adventure.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of them
experienced challenges

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:49.060 align:middle line:90%
throughout the way.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Every single one
of them discovered

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.447 align:middle line:84%
what their gifts are and
is bringing them back

00:41:52.447 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:90%
to the world in some way.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beautiful
thing is because it now

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:90%
gives meaning to life.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.340 align:middle line:84%
It gives us an exciting reason
to wake up every single day,

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.040 align:middle line:84%
because we're living
into the hero's journey.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.460 align:middle line:84%
We get to live this
adventure that we're on.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You spoke to meaning just
recently about how, you know,

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Victor Frankl was even able
to find meaning amidst dire

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:90%
situations.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.230 align:middle line:84%
How is meaning
and why is meaning

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.350 align:middle line:84%
so important to
people in this life?

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, essentially, we
are meaning-making machines.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Every moment,
event, or experience

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.640 align:middle line:84%
is just an event, a
moment, or an experience.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we as human beings
are wonderful at placing

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.723 align:middle line:84%
negative meanings on certain
situations then replaying those

00:42:37.723 --> 00:42:40.390 align:middle line:84%
over and over in our minds, like
stepping into a really bad film

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and watching it
over and over again.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:84%
What we realize is, everything
that we've experienced in life

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what we
needed to experience.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.665 align:middle line:84%
Everything we've been through
has been divinely orchestrated

00:42:52.665 --> 00:42:55.040 align:middle line:84%
in some way to bring us to
this present moment right now.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you are grateful
for this moment,

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.740 align:middle line:84%
you must, by
definition, be grateful

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.198 align:middle line:84%
for every single
moment that you've

00:43:01.198 --> 00:43:03.100 align:middle line:84%
been through that got
you to this moment,

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and every single one
that unfolds beyond that.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the meaning is
something that we can place

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:09.460 align:middle line:90%
on events and experiences.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.587 align:middle line:10%
So if we feel like
something negative happened

00:43:12.587 --> 00:43:14.920 align:middle line:10%
to us in our lives, we don't
have to see it as negative.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.337 align:middle line:84%
If we feel like we're going
through something challenging,

00:43:17.337 --> 00:43:19.840 align:middle line:84%
we get to actually apply
this meaning making principle

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.670 align:middle line:84%
to what we're going
through right now,

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.070 align:middle line:90%
because it's not good or bad.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:90%
We get to decide what it is.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And so every single challenge we
experience-- which, newsflash,

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.000 align:middle line:84%
you will continue to
experience challenging things

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:31.800 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:90%
Every single person does.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Nothing great has ever been
accomplished without someone

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.360 align:middle line:84%
going through
extreme challenges,

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.328 align:middle line:84%
extreme adversity,
extreme criticism

00:43:39.328 --> 00:43:40.870 align:middle line:84%
by people who didn't
believe in them.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:42.537 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we get to
take all those things

00:43:42.537 --> 00:43:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and put our own meaning on it.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So my meaning for everything
I've experienced in my life

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is it's been beautifully,
divinely orchestrated.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.640 align:middle line:84%
When I wake up and I feel
a bit of a dissonance--

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I call it a divine discomfort--
between where I am right now

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and what I know I am
capable of, the meaning I'm

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.950 align:middle line:90%
placing on that is beautiful.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.623 align:middle line:84%
I'm not upset
about that feeling.

00:44:01.623 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm grateful that
it's there, because now I

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.440 align:middle line:90%
get to step fully into that.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I didn't
have something

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that I felt like I was
working towards or moving

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.850 align:middle line:84%
into or becoming or doing
or giving in some capacity,

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that would
lose the purpose of life.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there's
always something

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:84%
that we as human
beings are striving

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:22.230 align:middle line:90%
to do in this lifetime.

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.030 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.960 align:middle line:90%
I believe in you.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.627 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I want
to go to your church.

00:44:26.627 --> 00:44:29.430 align:middle line:90%


00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:84%
How-- give me some
more examples of how

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:middle line:84%
you're enabling this into the
modern framework of society.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.110 align:middle line:84%
So you're taking your
lessons that you've

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.862 align:middle line:84%
discovered in many ways through
doing philanthropic work

00:44:39.862 --> 00:44:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're guiding people
through this process.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Now you're guiding
organizations.

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:50.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, what hope do you have
for the world in this work?

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:51.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you hope that
more people wake up

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.100 align:middle line:90%
to finding their purpose?

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that that's
the most important work

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.640 align:middle line:90%
that we can do?

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.140 align:middle line:84%
How do we solve some of the
biggest problems on the planet

00:44:59.140 --> 00:44:59.940 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.023 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are big
questions, but how does that

00:45:02.023 --> 00:45:06.030 align:middle line:84%
tie into sort of the whole
honey of our conversation?

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll share
a story with you.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's the story of
a boy and a starfish.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:12.870 align:middle line:90%
And the story goes like this.

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:16.260 align:middle line:84%
One morning, an old man
is walking on the beach.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And he looks down and sees
in the distance what looks

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:90%
like a dancing silhouette.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And as he gets
closer, he realized,

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.670 align:middle line:90%
it's not a dancing silhouette.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.142 align:middle line:90%
It's actually a little boy.

00:45:26.142 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And what the little
boy is doing is

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.640 align:middle line:84%
he's picking starfish
up from the beach

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and he's throwing them into
the ocean one at a time--

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.008 align:middle line:84%
picking up a starfish and
throwing it in the ocean.

00:45:35.008 --> 00:45:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And the old man, he's
lived kind of a rough life.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:84%
He kind of sees
things a certain way

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and he's a little bit cynical.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And he says, boy,
what are you doing?

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And the boy says, you
can't see what's happening?

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.010 align:middle line:84%
He said, the sun's out
in the middle of the sky.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.390 align:middle line:90%
The tide's gone out.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.647 align:middle line:84%
There's starfish
lining the beach.

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't pick them up
and throw them in the ocean,

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.920 align:middle line:90%
they're going to die.

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:55.810 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
burn up and die.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And the old man looks
and looks, and says,

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.610 align:middle line:84%
boy, there's miles of beach this
way, miles of beach that way,

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:06.030 align:middle line:84%
there's thousands if not tens
of thousands of starfish.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:09.390 align:middle line:84%
You can't possibly
make a difference.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.785 align:middle line:84%
And the little boy
picks up a starfish,

00:46:13.785 --> 00:46:17.730 align:middle line:84%
throws it in, and says, it
made a difference to that one.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And what I feel is I am
that little boy that's

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:84%
picking up one starfish at
a time and throwing it in.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think this story is a
powerful illustration of, yes,

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.893 align:middle line:84%
there are miles
of beach this way

00:46:28.893 --> 00:46:30.060 align:middle line:90%
and miles of beach that way.

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.270 align:middle line:90%
There are countless challenges--

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.970 align:middle line:84%
environmental, social,
financial, political-- so many

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.560 align:middle line:90%
challenges our world is facing.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.728 align:middle line:84%
And yet, most people will
be the old man and say,

00:46:40.728 --> 00:46:42.270 align:middle line:84%
you can't possibly
make a difference.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Why even try?

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there are some of us--
and there are more and more.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.810 align:middle line:84%
This community is
growing of people

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:50.518 align:middle line:84%
who are just going to
say, you know what,

00:46:50.518 --> 00:46:53.550 align:middle line:84%
let me pick up what my starfish
is to pick up and throw in.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And just by doing
that, just by being

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.320 align:middle line:84%
in that process of
picking up our starfish

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and throwing it in, it's
inspiring other people.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And so here I am, seven years
later, on this Greatness

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Foundation journey
and I realize,

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.920 align:middle line:84%
we have this community
of tens of thousands,

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.400 align:middle line:84%
if not hundreds of thousands of
people who, all of the sudden,

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.170 align:middle line:84%
I've just been picking up
one starfish at a time,

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.040 align:middle line:90%
throwing it in.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I look back behind me or
next to me or in front of me

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:16.122 align:middle line:84%
and people are picking up
starfish and throwing them in

00:47:16.122 --> 00:47:17.630 align:middle line:84%
because they've
watched me do it.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And so my goal is just to
continue to pick that up,

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.570 align:middle line:90%
whatever my starfish is.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.290 align:middle line:90%
And everyone has their own.

00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:26.217 align:middle line:84%
And as other people
join this collective--

00:47:26.217 --> 00:47:28.800 align:middle line:84%
figuring out what their starfish
and putting it in the ocean--

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.410 align:middle line:84%
it inspires other people
to do the same thing.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
I really believe

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:35.250 align:middle line:84%
that we, as a collective
consciousness,

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.930 align:middle line:84%
as humanity, will
tip the scales.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.930 align:middle line:84%
We're going to reach a
tipping point where there

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.092 align:middle line:84%
are more people who are doing
the picking up of the starfish

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and throwing it in than that
are standing there criticizing

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and wondering and
saying, we can't possibly

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.697 align:middle line:90%
make a difference.

00:47:47.697 --> 00:47:49.530 align:middle line:84%
So I believe if every
single person actually

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.072 align:middle line:84%
connected with what
their purpose is,

00:47:51.072 --> 00:47:52.750 align:middle line:84%
what their starfish
is, and just said,

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do it, one
at a time, one at a time--

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.667 align:middle line:84%
that's how it's going
to shift humanity.

00:47:56.667 --> 00:47:59.370 align:middle line:84%
That's going to solve
every single problem

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:01.890 align:middle line:84%
or challenge, opportunity,
that our world is facing.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So it comes down, absolutely,
to an individual level.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:08.940 align:middle line:84%
We each have our purpose and
our greatness to step into.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In our society, the way that
we've incentivized the modern

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:19.800 align:middle line:84%
world is really an ROI based
or a GDP-based ideology.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's this Gross
Domestic Product.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So we've created a
for-profit incentivization

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.060 align:middle line:90%
system for our world.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.920 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
this is something

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that helps us improve our
scoring metric as a developed

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.660 align:middle line:90%
country--

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.750 align:middle line:84%
more car crashes and more
accidents and more emergency

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.300 align:middle line:90%
care improves our GDP.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.860 align:middle line:84%
More sick people going into
hospitals improves our GDP.

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Moms going back
to work with haste

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and putting their
child into childcare

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.790 align:middle line:84%
increases their
economic capability.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.290 align:middle line:84%
They're spending
money on childcare.

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.873 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
workforce earning money

00:48:53.873 --> 00:48:55.450 align:middle line:90%
and then spending more money.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And yet, staying at home to
care for the emotional health

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.950 align:middle line:84%
of that child is not
recognized as improving GDP.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:04.740 align:middle line:84%
The surfer who walks out
of the water is like, woo.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And you see that person, you're
like, why is he so excited?

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.370 align:middle line:90%
He's just lit up my day.

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:14.700 align:middle line:84%
He's not adding to Gross
Domestic Product or GDP,

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and so therefore
they're not economically

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:17.860 align:middle line:90%
valuable in our society.

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Your mother tending
to her horses

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and being a really
heart-centered gardener

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.130 align:middle line:84%
is caring for the microbes
and making an improvement.

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's not impacting
GDP, our metric.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.520 align:middle line:84%
How do you think our
metrics have screwed up

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.870 align:middle line:90%
what we do in the world?

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And how would you
explain that people

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.670 align:middle line:84%
doing the most basic,
simple, heart-centered things

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.190 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
thing they can do?

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, everything
comes down to incentives.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
in the Western world,

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:45.690 align:middle line:84%
we are incentivized
by profits and we're

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:46.900 align:middle line:90%
incentivized by money.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, you see the
kind of systematic challenges

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.650 align:middle line:84%
that our world is facing,
including higher levels

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:55.320 align:middle line:84%
of depression and suicide
than ever before, including

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.225 align:middle line:84%
overmedication,
overprescription.

00:49:57.225 --> 00:49:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at
all of the problems

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and they really stem
from incentives,

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to include the education model
and the curriculum that's

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.430 align:middle line:90%
being taught.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:08.430 align:middle line:84%
All of this is because of the
incentives that are placed.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So Bucky Fuller has this
amazing quote about,

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.450 align:middle line:84%
don't try to change
the current model.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Create a new one that
makes the old one obsolete.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And I love just thinking
about new models that can make

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:22.765 align:middle line:84%
the old one
obsolete, including--

00:50:22.765 --> 00:50:24.890 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking at GDP,
Gross Domestic Product--

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.330 align:middle line:84%
what if we looked at things like
gross purpose product or gross

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:27.630 align:middle line:90%
happy--

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:28.230 align:middle line:90%
GHP.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.230 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at what
makes people the happiest?

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:32.310 align:middle line:90%
What makes people most alive?

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I've seen some
fascinating ideas for this,

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:38.160 align:middle line:84%
down to wearing some
kind of trackable device

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.400 align:middle line:84%
that tracks the kind of
energy that you're emitting.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's put 0, you know, love
or hate, anger, fear, 1,000

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.320 align:middle line:84%
being love, joy, and peace,
and where you feel most in flow

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:50.230 align:middle line:90%
and alive.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if we
were incentivized

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.635 align:middle line:84%
to be in that kind
of energy space more.

00:50:54.635 --> 00:50:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
these can probably

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:57.870 align:middle line:84%
sound like really crazy
ideas and concepts,

00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:59.662 align:middle line:84%
but what if we start
moving closer to that?

00:50:59.662 --> 00:51:02.160 align:middle line:84%
What if we change the incentives
so people are in alignment

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.250 align:middle line:90%
with their purpose?

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.670 align:middle line:84%
This is why I'm passionate
about providing for basic needs

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:08.220 align:middle line:84%
because I feel like when people
are in a scarcity mindset

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and they're concerned
about how to pay the bills

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.083 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that the
lights stay on in their home

00:51:13.083 --> 00:51:15.000 align:middle line:84%
or putting food on their
table for their kids,

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.833 align:middle line:84%
when you're operating
in a scarcity mindset,

00:51:16.833 --> 00:51:19.440 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to even think about
what your creative passions

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:20.318 align:middle line:90%
and pursuits are.

00:51:20.318 --> 00:51:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what if all of
those needs were met?

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:24.930 align:middle line:84%
What if we found a way to meet
everyone's basic needs so we

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:27.480 align:middle line:84%
can start to move up
Maslow's hierarchy of needs

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.610 align:middle line:90%
into the very peak?

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The very top of Maslow's
pyramid of hierarchy of needs

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:90%
is self-actualization.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.690 align:middle line:84%
He says, "what one
can be, one must be."

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:38.970 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that
we're here to become?

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And so what you'll
notice in a society

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.140 align:middle line:84%
where people do have
those basic needs met

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:45.997 align:middle line:84%
is they start to follow more
of those passionate pursuits,

00:51:45.997 --> 00:51:47.580 align:middle line:84%
the things that
they're curious about,

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:48.955 align:middle line:84%
the things they're
interested in.

00:51:48.955 --> 00:51:52.260 align:middle line:84%
People re-engage with the
arts and poetry and music.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that it comes
down to not only meeting

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.140 align:middle line:84%
basic needs but creating an
entirely new incentive model

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.170 align:middle line:84%
where people are now
encouraged to go pursue what

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:02.865 align:middle line:90%
it is they're passionate about.

00:52:02.865 --> 00:52:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm really glad I
asked you that question,

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.240 align:middle line:84%
because that was
an amazing answer.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.150 align:middle line:84%
What are some examples
of people doing

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:12.480 align:middle line:84%
something that's important, that
is not necessarily recognized?

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Like the mother
deciding, you know what?

00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be here
and really consciously

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally
engage with my child

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.870 align:middle line:84%
during the early
stages of its life.

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Or your mother, for
instance, how she's

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.710 align:middle line:84%
diving deep into
that simple practice

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of just caring for her alpacas,
her one llama, her horses,

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:27.110 align:middle line:90%
and her garden.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, can you give
people permission--

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.370 align:middle line:84%
is it OK to give people
permission for them

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:35.760 align:middle line:84%
to do these simple pursuits
that might seem trivial,

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.160 align:middle line:84%
but are actually deep dives
into really connecting

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.620 align:middle line:84%
with the importance
of being human?

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only do I give people
permission to do that,

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I believe it's necessary.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.810 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
poet must make poetry.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:50.490 align:middle line:90%
The artist must make art.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.410 align:middle line:90%
The musician must make music.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:55.830 align:middle line:84%
The gardener must take
care of the garden.

00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:57.600 align:middle line:90%
What one can be, one must be.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.780 align:middle line:84%
We must become what
we're here to become.

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the beautiful thing
is we get to figure that out

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.780 align:middle line:90%
on our own what that is for us.

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And yet, every
single one of those

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:11.430 align:middle line:90%
is crucial to the bigger whole.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:13.770 align:middle line:84%
There's this fascinating
study that was done in

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:15.090 align:middle line:90%
and coin that was termed--

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:18.090 align:middle line:84%
a term that was coined
called the overview effect,

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:21.900 align:middle line:84%
which is when astronauts go to
outer space and they come back,

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.112 align:middle line:84%
their families and their friends
start to go, something changed.

00:53:25.112 --> 00:53:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Fundamentally, there's something
different about this human

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:28.260 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.177 align:middle line:84%
And as they've done these
longitudinal studies

00:53:30.177 --> 00:53:32.730 align:middle line:84%
on astronauts and figuring
out what exactly shifted,

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:35.430 align:middle line:84%
they came up with this term
called the overview effect.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:37.290 align:middle line:90%
What it boils down to is this--

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.540 align:middle line:84%
when you're in space
looking down on the Earth,

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:44.160 align:middle line:84%
you see the Earth as a
living, breathing organism.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And we, as humans, as
part of this organism,

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.010 align:middle line:90%
are like the cells in our body.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.890 align:middle line:84%
We are a small part of
a much bigger puzzle.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.585 align:middle line:84%
And yet, just like we
need every single cell

00:53:55.585 --> 00:53:57.960 align:middle line:84%
to come together to make tissue
and tissue to make organs

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and organs to make up the
body, every single human being,

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.180 align:middle line:84%
when they're alive
and on purpose,

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.030 align:middle line:84%
gets to be the cell that is
functioning at its highest

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:08.700 align:middle line:84%
capacity in order to
make this organism, which

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:09.750 align:middle line:90%
is planet Earth.

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:11.670 align:middle line:84%
They see it as a
living, breathing being.

00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:12.920 align:middle line:90%
We're just a part of it.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a great
opportunity for us

00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:18.575 align:middle line:84%
to feel insignificant
and extremely significant

00:54:18.575 --> 00:54:20.700 align:middle line:84%
at the exact same time--
insignificant in the sense

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.720 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, we are a small
piece of a much bigger puzzle,

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and incredibly significant
because what we do matters.

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Whether we take up that starfish
and put it in the ocean,

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.390 align:middle line:84%
whether we step
into our purpose,

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:33.450 align:middle line:84%
whether we do what
we're here to do,

00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:35.490 align:middle line:84%
every single one of
those cells needs

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:37.420 align:middle line:84%
to be functioning
the best possible way

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.420 align:middle line:84%
that it can be in order
for the whole to operate

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.720 align:middle line:90%
the way that it needs to.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I knew you had more to say.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.010 align:middle line:90%
I knew you had to say that.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:44.610 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.410 align:middle line:90%
That was perfect.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.970 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what I also
wanted you to contribute to,

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.920 align:middle line:84%
so thank you so much
for your contribution.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.810 align:middle line:90%
Mike, you're a force for good.

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:53.790 align:middle line:90%
You're a force for God.

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.800 align:middle line:84%
You're a force for this
creative energy on planet.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful for the
work that you're doing.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for your time today.

00:54:59.250 --> 00:54:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, brother.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Grateful for you.
