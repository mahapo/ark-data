00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:14.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Fumbled across in practice.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking for better
solutions for heart disease.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:84%
My mom died of
sudden cardiac death.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.430 align:middle line:84%
She died a couple
of months after

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:90%
her two-vessel angioplasty.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what I did in my career.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I spent morning till night
working in the cath lab,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:84%
where we did heart
catheterizations

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and certain stents
and angioplasty,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:90%
those kinds of procedures.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And my own mother dies
a couple of months

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
after her procedure
in New Jersey.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, it got me thinking that
there were better answers than

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
just having people come to a
hospital-- a procedure room,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:90%
a cath lab--

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.690 align:middle line:84%
and then send them on their way
with their statin cholesterol

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
drug, advised to cut their fat,
eat more healthy whole grains.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.520 align:middle line:90%
And they're back.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So those efforts do not
put a stop to this disease,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:90%
nor do they even slow it.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
They have a very
minor effect, if any.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.040 align:middle line:90%
It's an odd thing.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical industry
has turned cholesterol

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:90%
into a huge revenue opportunity.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And it has very little
effect, to reduce cholesterol,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:90%
on reducing cardiovascular risk.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.707 align:middle line:90%
So I tried to find better ways.

00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:90%
I was seeking better ways.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to start looking
really hard for those answers,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:84%
because those answers
are just not out there.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, the number one cause,
the most common cause

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:90%
for a heart attack--

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
needing stents, bypass surgery,
those sorts of things--

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
the most common abnormality
is not high cholesterol.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I call that the kindergarten
version of heart disease

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.530 align:middle line:90%
causation.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:84%
The most common cause is an
excess of small LDL particles.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:90%
It's called LDL cholesterol.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:84%
But that's a really
dumbed-down version.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It's an excess of small
LDL particles coupled

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
with some other things, such
as inflammation and high blood

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:90%
sugars--

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:90%
very, very common abnormalities.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So I set out to
try to find better

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
solutions for my patients at
very large cardiology practice.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And I saw what
happened to people

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:90%
who needed these procedures.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.468 align:middle line:90%
And some die.

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:90%
It can be a fatal disease, too.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not a funny business.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:90%
It's not a light matter.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's only
two things that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:84%
cause an excess of small LDL
particles, that leads to heart

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:90%
attack and heart disease.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.068 align:middle line:90%
And that's grains and sugars--

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:90%
not my speculation, by the way.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
This science is quite
well sorted out.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:84%
It's been sorted out
for over 20 years.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:90%
But it's not talked about much.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
My cynical view is it's
not talked about much

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
because there's no pot of
gold for the treatment.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
It's treated, it's corrected--
not by a little bit,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:90%
but entirely--

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
in the majority of people by
eliminating those two causes.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:84%
No grains, no sugars,
and small LDL plummets.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.718 align:middle line:84%
A typical measure would be
1,800 nanomoles per liter.

00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:90%
That's how it's measured.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a particle
count per volume.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:84%
It drops to zero, or
some other low number.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not a little bit better.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a ton better.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:90%
And you do it for free.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:90%
So I did this in my patients.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
To my great surprise-- so I
watched their small LDL values

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.202 align:middle line:90%
plummet, as you'd expect.

00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I watched other
good things happen,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
like triglyceride levels
drop and blood sugar drop.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But people came back me and
said, I don't understand.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Why did I lose 57 pounds?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:90%
I didn't try.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:90%
I didn't exercise.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:90%
I didn't cut my calories.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't cut my fat.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you told
me to eat more fat!

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:90%
And don't push the plate away.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Why did my rheumatoid
arthritis go away?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Why did my ulcerative colitis,
that plagued me for years

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and led to bloody diarrhea
and I needed transfusions

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.530 align:middle line:84%
every few months,
why did it stop?

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Why did my mind fog lift?

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Why did my migraines headaches,
that I had five times a week

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that were crippling and I
had to take multiple drugs,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:90%
go away after just a week?

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.968 align:middle line:84%
Why is my acid reflux
now gone after five days?

00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Why is my irritable
bowel syndrome symptoms

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:90%
gone within the first week?

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So I experienced this outpouring
of incredible stories.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And my first response
was, I don't know.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why you had these
transformations in your health

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:90%
and appearance.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But it became clear on a
large basis, face-to-face

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
in my practice, that there
was something fishy going on.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.378 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
try to understand.

00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:11.670 align:middle line:90%
What in the world was going on?

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I eliminated the
foods that we're told

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.029 align:middle line:84%
should dominate the
diet, right, a diet

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.720 align:middle line:90%
centered on whole grains.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
We're told now that
70% of all calories

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:84%
should come from grains,
preferably whole grains.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:90%
So we're told to eat this food.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:84%
When you take it out, all
these incredible things happen.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:90%
So I started to dig.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Why would removing the food
that is the darling of the US

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
dietary guidelines for
Americans, The American Heart

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Association, its counterparts
in Australia and the UK,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
the favorite of the American
Diabetes Association,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.528 align:middle line:84%
the thing that's held
up as a perfect food

00:04:47.528 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
by the Academy of
Nutrition and Dietetics--

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
we take that food out and
wonderful things happen.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:90%
What happened in this thing?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started to poke around--

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
into agribusiness and
agricultural genetics-- to see,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
what happened to
wheat, in particular?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:90%
This applies to more than wheat.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:90%
But I picked on wheat.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:90%
I call it the ring leader.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the worst of the
worst among all grains.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, digging, it
became clear that what

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.740 align:middle line:84%
we're being sold
today as modern wheat

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
is something entirely different
than what it was 40 years ago.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
very noble effort--

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:84%
not a dishonest or evil
effort, but a noble effort

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to increase the yield per
acre to help feed the world's

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:90%
hungry.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:90%
A noble effort.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But in those efforts,
they bred wheat

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over
again, with various strains.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:90%
They bred wheat.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Wheat is a grass.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.530 align:middle line:84%
They bred wheat with
other wild grasses

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to extract certain
genetic characteristics.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they started to
subject wheat to other methods,

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:84%
such as the methods
of mutagenesis,

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
the purposeful
induction of mutations

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
using toxic
chemicals, radiation,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:90%
gamma rays, et cetera.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Problem-- you can't control
the mutations you get.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.300 align:middle line:84%
You can't order up
the mutation you want,

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:84%
say for better pest
resistance or reduced height.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
You just get dozens, perhaps
hundreds of mutations.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
If they're not fatal,
the plant survives.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.025 align:middle line:84%
But you've induced
numerous mutations.

00:06:19.025 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
this all occurred

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
prior to the age of
genetic modification,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:90%
genetic engineering.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And I point that out
because agribusiness,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.653 align:middle line:84%
who does not like
me very much, says

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing as
genetically modified wheat.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Davis is wrong.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:90%
No, there is no such thing as--

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:90%
that's right.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Wheat was changed by methods
that pre-date genetic

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:84%
modification, which
in many instances

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
are far worse than
genetic modification.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm no defender of
genetic modification.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an awful
practice, or at least

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:90%
the current versions are.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But believe it or not,
it's an improvement

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.310 align:middle line:84%
over the methods that were
used to generate modern wheat.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:90%
So wheat is now--

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:84%
it's no longer a 4 and 1/2
foot, five foot tall, two

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.675 align:middle line:90%
meter tall--

00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:90%
nearly two meter tall--

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:90%
traditional plant.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an 18-inch tall, short,
thick, stocky, semi-dwarf

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:90%
strain, they call it.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So that change in
appearance is accompanied

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
by multiple changes in its
genetics, in it's biochemistry,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and the proteins, in
particular, that are expressed.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And when products
made with high-yield,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.200 align:middle line:84%
semi-dwarf wheat were
put on store shelves

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.800 align:middle line:84%
around 1985, the
late '80s, that's

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
when we saw an explosion
in numerous problems.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't
prove cause and effect.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty well convinced it
is probably a cause and effect,

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:84%
because it coincides perfectly
with a dramatic increase

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:84%
in calorie intake in Australia,
the US, Western Europe, UK.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
It coincides perfectly
with an explosion

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
in autoimmune diseases and in
type 2 diabetes and obesity,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and because we see all those
conditions reverse promptly

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle line:90%
with grain elimination.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the problems arose
from these changes introduced

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.120 align:middle line:84%
into wheat-- and, to some
degree, other related grains,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.763 align:middle line:84%
too, though wheat being
the worst of the worst.

00:08:11.763 --> 00:08:14.178 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:14.178 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Even if viewers don't
accept this notion

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.948 align:middle line:84%
that there are unique proteins
created in modern wheat,

00:08:25.948 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:84%
like gliadin, wheat
germ and gluten--

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole question
of toxic proteins.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Even if we put all that aside,
there was the inarguable--

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could say I'm a genius.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.280 align:middle line:84%
But it's in every
textbook of nutrition.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:84%
If you looked up
the glycemic index

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
of foods made of wheat flour--

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
that is, how high
blood sugar ranges over

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.510 align:middle line:84%
90 minutes after
consuming a food,

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.900 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that the foods with
the highest glycemic index,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:84%
the highest potential to
raise your blood sugar,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:90%
are all grains.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:84%
They're all products made of
wheat flour and corn starch

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and corn meal and oats
and other related grains.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been told to
stack our diets heavily--

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
low in fat, right, rich
in healthy whole grains.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:84%
What we're being
told, in effect,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:84%
is follow a lifestyle
that guarantees

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:84%
that you gain weight and
express higher blood sugars,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're on your way
to type 2 diabetes.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Numerous changes.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
One thing that has not
occurred is an increase

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:90%
in the gluten content.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:90%
That's quite clear.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I mention that
because it's often

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
claimed that the source
of problems in wheat

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:90%
is an increase in gluten.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's simply not true.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.492 align:middle line:90%
You and I are after truth.

00:09:45.492 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want
to make up stuff.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:90%
So what is true?

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:90%
What has been changed?

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know lots of
things have been changed.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We know that the structure of
the gliadin protein in wheat

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:84%
is very different today
than it was 40 years ago.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:84%
This is about a lot more than
celiac disease, as you know.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:90%
But just the form of gliadin--

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
people say gluten, but
it's really gliadin--

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
that provokes celiac
disease, the most potent form

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:84%
of that protein is enriched
in modern strains of wheat

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
dramatically, compared
to wheat of 40 years ago.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:84%
There is something called
wheat germ agglutinin,

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:84%
which is a very toxic protein
to your gastrointestinal tract.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.923 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like gluten,
but it's agglutinin.

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It's unrelated, except it
comes from the same plant.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Farmers and geneticists
selected strains of wheat

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.060 align:middle line:84%
that expressed greater
quantities of wheat germ

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
agglutinin because
it's also a pesticide.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It kills pests.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:90%
It drives off pests.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So they select strains with
higher wheat germ agglutinin

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
content, more toxic to the
human gastrointestinal tract.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a very potent toxin.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:84%
It's also a very highly
inflammatory protein,

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.750 align:middle line:84%
the little small
quantities that are

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:90%
absorbed into the bloodstream.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
There's also something
called phytates

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:90%
that are very rich in grains.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And these are very
potent binders

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.230 align:middle line:84%
of minerals, particularly
calcium, magnesium, iron,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:90%
and zinc.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And so if I eat two slices
of whole wheat bread,

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.670 align:middle line:84%
say, in a sandwich, 90%
of the iron in my diet

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
is prevented from
being absorbed.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And the phytates have
been enriched in grains

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.140 align:middle line:84%
because they, likewise,
also provide pest resistance

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:90%
to the wheat plant.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:90%
There's much more.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.345 align:middle line:84%
But in other words, it's
not just about gluten.

00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So I have to remind people
over and over and over again--

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because they say, gluten--
the problem is gluten.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.627 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go gluten-free.

00:11:36.627 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to eat those
gluten-free foods.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to
encourage people

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
to get away from
that kind of thinking

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and accept that the
entire package is corrupt.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
The entire package of wheat and
other closely related grains

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
have a whole collection
of toxic components.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:90%
So don't think about gluten.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Think about the entire
package as being a flawed food

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:90%
for human consumption.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.085 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a whole
list of things that happens.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:84%
So the gliadin protein
is a direct toxin

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:90%
to the gastrointestinal tract.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:90%
It gets partially digested.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I should point out that
one of the problems

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.300 align:middle line:90%
we have with consuming grains--

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
the seeds of grass, as that's
what grains are, literally--

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
are they're largely indigestible
because humans are not

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
fit to consume the
grasses of the world.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- I don't
know if you guys have

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:90%
to cut your lawn every summer.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But I have to have my lawn cut
once a week in the summertime.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.952 align:middle line:84%
You'd think we could
save the clippings

00:12:40.952 --> 00:12:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and toss it on top of a
salad with a little Roquefort

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:90%
dressing.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:90%
But of course, you can't.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.072 align:middle line:90%
What if you did?

00:12:46.072 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:90%
That's been done, of course--

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:90%
people starving.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.530 align:middle line:84%
People have tried to eat
grasses in their various forms.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, you throw it up.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.085 align:middle line:84%
It's very painful--
bloating, diarrhea.

00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:58.790 align:middle line:90%
And it comes out undigested.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's because humans
cannot digest grasses--

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:84%
nor any of the components
of grasses, whether it's

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:90%
the stalk, the husk, the seed.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So grains are the
seeds of grasses.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And they are not entirely,
but largely indigestible.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's why so many
of the proteins in grains

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:84%
are so toxic to humans,
because we can't digest them.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So the gliadin protein
is directly toxic.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It's broken down partially
into small pieces-- peptides.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Those are also highly toxic to
the gastrointestinal system.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
That wheat germ agglutinin
protein we talked about

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
is very toxic to the
gastrointestinal system.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
For instance, it blocks the
hormone cholecystokinin.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, long word but
all it means is,

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.670 align:middle line:90%
I eat something containing fat.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And the fat provokes my
gastrointestinal tract

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:90%
to release this hormone, CCK.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And that causes your
gallbladder to spit out its bile

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
to emulsify fats
and your pancreas

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:84%
to release pancreatic enzymes
to break down the fats--

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
unless wheat germ agglutinin
is in the vicinity.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:90%
It blocks that path--

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:84%
thereby, can't
get your bile out.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Bile stasis--
gallstones over time.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Your pancreatic enzymes don't
get expressed like they should.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And you don't digest
food properly.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:90%
You get acid reflux.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%
You get heartburn.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.900 align:middle line:84%
You get irritable
bowel syndrome.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Undigested or partially
digested food,

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:84%
without enough bile
and pancreatic enzymes,

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
rots in your
gastrointestinal tract.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:90%
That has other reactions.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So you get changes in
bowel flora, dysbiosis.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
There are other reasons that
people consume grains and have

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:90%
toxic effects.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
There are numerous
other components,

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.092 align:middle line:84%
like alpha-amylase
inhibitors, and names

00:14:39.092 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to know.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Point being, it's
not just gluten.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:42.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not one thing.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It's really a whole
collection of things.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
think, oh, he's

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:90%
just making it up, exaggerating.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.950 align:middle line:84%
It all boils down to the fact
that wheat and related grains

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:90%
are the seeds of grasses.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And Homo sapiens is
just not equipped

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:84%
to consume grasses
nor their seeds.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.945 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:01.945 --> 00:15:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:90%
I think lots of reasons.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I won't pretend to be an expert
in sociology and anthropology.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But I could conceive
of a number of reasons.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I hate to admit
this-- it tastes good.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.515 align:middle line:90%
It can taste good.

00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But if something tastes
good, it doesn't mean

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:90%
it's therefore good for you.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's a thing
that can fool us.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:90%
It has an opiate-like effect.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So that gliadin protein,
upon partial digestion--

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:84%
so if I eat an
egg yolk or an egg

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
white that's rich in protein,
I break those proteins

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:90%
down to single amino acids.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.350 align:middle line:84%
That's how humans are supposed
to digest the proteins.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:84%
If you eat the proteins
in the seeds of grasses--

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:84%
wheat and grains--
they're not broken down

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.350 align:middle line:90%
into single amino acids.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
They're broken down into
pieces, and sometimes

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:90%
not digested at all.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Like that wheat germ agglutinin
is not digested at all.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:90%
It comes out intact.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Gliadin is partially digestible,
to small pieces-- about four

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
or five amino acids long.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But those little
proteins or peptides

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
have very unique
amino acid structures.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And that confers an opioid
or opiate-like effect.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
That is, it acts like a
morphine or a heroin effect

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:90%
on your brain.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:84%
It's actually been shown to
bind to the opiate receptors

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:90%
of the human brain.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it also
binds to the opiate receptors

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.682 align:middle line:90%
in your gastrointestinal tract.

00:16:24.682 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it causes
constipation, another reason it

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:90%
causes gastrointestinal upset.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.290 align:middle line:90%
But the opiate effect--

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:84%
so it causes an addictive
relationship with food.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And it stimulates appetite.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:90%
So it creates a need for itself.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Plus, it can yield
large quantities

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:90%
in a small plot of land.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's become
more and more true

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:84%
as agribusiness
got into the act.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And it worked into
tradition and habit.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a lot
of reasons why it's become

00:16:54.650 --> 00:17:00.270 align:middle line:84%
so deeply ingrained-- sorry,
"ingrained"-- into human life.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I think
it's sometimes hard to get

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
this message across,
because what I'm challenging

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:84%
is this notion that we
should ever consume grains.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's easy to show
that modern versions of wheat

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and grains have been
dramatically changed

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
at the hands of geneticists
and agribusiness.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.270 align:middle line:84%
But I'd push that
argument even farther,

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
that grains were always
a problem for humans.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:90%
So you know who does know this?

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:90%
The anthropologists.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.940 align:middle line:84%
They've known this
for several decades,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:84%
that when humans were largely
hunter gatherers or conducted

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
limited farming, like
growing fruit and those kinds

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
of plants, there was
almost no tooth decay.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
There was very
little bone disease.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And men were taller,
and likewise women.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:84%
When humans turned to the
seeds of grasses, grains,

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.390 align:middle line:84%
which they did so in desperation
at first, around 10,000,

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years ago-- that is
on a large systematic scale--

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:84%
there was an explosion
in tooth decay.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Prior to the consumption
of grains, 1% to 3%

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of all teeth recovered showed
decay or tooth loss or abscess.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
After the incorporation of
grains, 16 to 49% of teeth

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:84%
showed decay,
abscess formation, or

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.460 align:middle line:90%
some other destructive effect.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:90%
Men lost five inches in height.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Women lost three
inches in height.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
That was an effect that only
lasted several centuries.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:20.925 align:middle line:84%
There was a partial
accommodation

00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:23.630 align:middle line:84%
to the deleterious effects
of grains, but nonetheless,

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
evidence of some
very peculiar effect.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:90%
There was more bone disease.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
There was evidence for iron
deficiency anemia showing up.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:90%
It shows up in the bones.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The anthropologists call
it porotic hyperostosis.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
when humans turned

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
the seeds of grasses for
substance to survive,

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
an explosion of health
problems appeared.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
This is well-established in
the anthropological record.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We also see this very same
phenomenon, not so much today,

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
but in the last
two centuries, when

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.640 align:middle line:84%
primitive cultures, who
were hunters and gatherers,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in New
Zealand or Northwest Pacific

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
coast of the US and Canada or
remote areas of Africa or South

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.115 align:middle line:84%
America, whenever primitive
cultures that were hunter

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:84%
and gatherers traded or somehow
obtained grains and sugars

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:84%
from westernized
people, they likewise

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
showed an explosion in
diabetes, obesity, hypertension,

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
tooth decay, facial
malformations, tooth abscess.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the number
one cause for suicide

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:84%
among these primitive cultures
when exposed to modern foods,

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:84%
was a tooth abscess because
it erodes the surface.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:90%
It's very painful.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And so those people
didn't have the advantage

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
of 10,000 years of
partial accommodation

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:90%
to the toxic effects of grains.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So they show the most
serious ill-effects

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:84%
they they're exposed
to grains and sugars.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
We see this over and over
again in Pima Indians,

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:90%
in Southwest US.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:84%
We see it in other
primitive cultures

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
who are exposed to
our modern foods.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And then they express all
the diseases of civilization

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
that we all just
count is bad luck,

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:84%
but they develop
them explosively.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have lots of evidence that
grains, and in this case sugar,

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
are inappropriate for
human consumption.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds
cynical and dark

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:84%
but therein lies
an incredible key

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.640 align:middle line:84%
to reclaiming your
control over health.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't just mean weight
or just type 2 diabetes.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Those are big issues.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking about an
incredible landscape of health

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:90%
problems can be reversed.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Not because we're
treating them and making

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
lots of billions of dollars
for the drug industry,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
removing the things

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:84%
that create the situation
in the first place.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.052 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:48.052 --> 00:20:51.500 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's an
odd thing about grasses

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and that is,
they're promiscuous.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:90%
They share genes quite freely.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So rye was the weed
in wheat fields

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.890 align:middle line:90%
for many thousands of years.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And so they exchanged genes.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference, of
course, in taste and appearance.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at these
two plants genetically,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that they're nearly
identical, just like just

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
like a chimpanzee is nearly
identical to a human,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:90%
genetically.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.490 align:middle line:84%
It's embarrassing how little
difference there really is.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, here, rye
essentially equals

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.210 align:middle line:84%
wheat and vise versa, likewise,
barley, very extensive

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:90%
overlap in genetics.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:84%
As we get farther down
the line of other grains,

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:84%
we drift away from some of the
similarities, oats, amaranth,

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:90%
triticale, millet.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:90%
At the most benign end is rice.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Let me restate that.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
At the less harmful end
of the spectrum is rice.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to
fall under the same trap

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.050 align:middle line:84%
that most of the nutrition
community has fallen into.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
That is, if something
is less harmful,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:90%
it must, therefore, be good.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can't always
draw that conclusion.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Less harmful is
simply less harmful.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
So rice is less harmful because
it's less than 1% protein.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the toxic
effects of grains

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.060 align:middle line:90%
come by way of the protein.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Most modern strains of wheat
yield about 14% to 18% protein.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Rice is less than 1% protein
so its toxic protein components

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:90%
are in much lesser quantities.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But it also means that
it's mostly starch.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:90%
It's like eating sugar.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So eating rice is
like eating sugar.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.890 align:middle line:84%
People say, well, how come
people in Asia are so skinny.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know
if you know this,

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.063 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot more
diabetics, type 2 diabetes,

00:22:41.063 --> 00:22:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and obesity in Asia,
now, India, China,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.200 align:middle line:90%
than there is in North America.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.475 align:middle line:84%
They have gone way beyond
us in sheer numbers.

00:22:49.475 --> 00:22:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as if
they're walking

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:90%
around skinny and healthy.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.050 align:middle line:84%
They're developing all the
diseases of civilization

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
that we have now that they have
more free access to calories,

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.630 align:middle line:90%
much of which is rice.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So rice has this problem of
a very high starch content,

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.630 align:middle line:84%
thereby lots and lots of
potential to raise blood sugar.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.928 align:middle line:90%
It also has some other issues.

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:84%
One of the proteins
that is present in rice

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:90%
is that wheat germ agglutinin.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It's poorly named
because it's in rice,

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's still called
wheat germ agglutinin.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
how toxic it can

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.010 align:middle line:84%
be, to the human
gastrointestinal tract

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and to the human body, when
absorbed into the bloodstream.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:84%
There's also this
recently raised issue

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:90%
of the arsenic content of rice.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And we know there have been
instances of chronic arsenic

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
poisoning from consumption
of rice as a staple in diet.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
What's being explored now
is, are there more subtle

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:90%
acute toxic effects?

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Our own FDA and USDA
likes to deny that there

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.920 align:middle line:90%
are any acute toxic effects.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:90%
But they are exploring it.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.240 align:middle line:90%
So the question is open.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So rice is at the
more benign end.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's by no means
entirely safe and harmless.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.374 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:55.374 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So I would classify-- this
has to be a little bit

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:90%
scientific, though.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
The grasses of the earth
are in the family Poaceae.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:84%
The family of grasses are simply
unsuited for human consumption.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to
make oats healthy.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.090 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to
make it healthy.

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
All you have to
prove it to yourself

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:90%
is check a blood sugar.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:84%
30 to 60 minutes
after you have a bowl

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
of stone-ground, organic
oatmeal with no added sugar,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:84%
you'll see a
sky-high blood sugar.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Blood sugars of 150 to 500
milligrams per deciliter

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.128 align:middle line:90%
are very common after oats.

00:24:29.128 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what you do, you
can't make the seeds of grasses

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
healthy or not have some
horrible health consequence.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we get into these other
foods that look like grains

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:90%
but really aren't, like quinoa.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, I try to put things in
simple terms for my readers.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.737 align:middle line:84%
And that is jelly
beans are not grains.

00:24:50.737 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't necessarily
mean it's good for you.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to be really
clear in our thinking here.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to look at
all foods and ask,

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:90%
are they truly healthy for us.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Something like
quinoa, which people

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:84%
often turn to as a replacement,
or buckwheat, which

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
is not a grain, either.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But they raise blood
sugar substantially.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a problem.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:15.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, modern people,
UK, Australia, US,

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.430 align:middle line:84%
there are so many type 2
diabetics, prediabetics,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and people who I
call, pre-prediabetic.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
High blood sugars
are the norm now.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.380 align:middle line:90%
We've got to undo that.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Having a bowl of quinoa
provides about 51 grams of sugar

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
equivalents,
carbohydrates, which

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.990 align:middle line:84%
will send your blood
sugar sky high and provoke

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.990 align:middle line:84%
all the adverse consequence
of a high blood sugar,

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:84%
insulin resistance,
growth and belly fat,

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.420 align:middle line:84%
risk for dementia, cancer, and
heart disease just for a start.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't replace a
mistake, seeds of grasses,

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:90%
with another mistake.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Particularly in our day
and age, we're human.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.560 align:middle line:84%
We have managed to
corrupt our bodies

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and change numerous
factors that make

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:84%
us less tolerant to those
kinds of foods anymore,

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.853 align:middle line:90%
such as bowel flora.

00:26:06.853 --> 00:26:09.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
adventures I've had to go down,

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:84%
this Wheat Belly
experience is that, if you

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:84%
take wheat and grains
out of the diet,

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:84%
you don't recover perfect
health by tomorrow.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll be far
better off and you'll

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
recover better
health if you also

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:27.230 align:middle line:84%
addressed all the disruptions
that are left in their wake.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of those
great disruptions

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.780 align:middle line:84%
is bowel flora, the
composition of microorganisms

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.160 align:middle line:90%
in your colon.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And so, now we've, for
the last several years,

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:84%
made a very specific effort
to restore normal bowel flora.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Health gets even better.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.900 align:middle line:90%
You'll lose even more weight.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Your blood sugar
comes down further.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Your blood pressure drops.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Your dreams are deeper.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Your sleep is deeper.

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Anxiety is reduced.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:90%
There are many other benefits.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
correct that disrupted

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:90%
health effects of grains.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Part of that is not
to over-consume foods

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.990 align:middle line:90%
that raise blood sugar.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.910 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I've seen this play out
many, many, many times, that

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
is professional athletes,
non-professional athletes

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:84%
experience dramatic
improvement in performance.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have to qualify
that because there's

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.410 align:middle line:84%
an initial decrement
in performance.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.702 align:middle line:84%
So when you first
go gluten-free--

00:27:26.702 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:84%
but I would say a
smarter way to do

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.070 align:middle line:84%
it is to go grain-free
and sugar-free

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:90%
or limit your sugar consumption.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
The first week, I
should point out,

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:84%
there's an opiate
withdrawal syndrome.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So performance does not
improve in the first week.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:84%
It degrades in the first
week because you feel awful.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:84%
You'll be nauseated,
tired, depressed,

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:90%
crying, rolled up in a ball.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's not pleasant.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:90%
But everybody gets through it.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:90%
The first week is bad.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
For people who perform at a high
level of athletic performance,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:84%
your performance will degrade
for four to six weeks.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But then it will exceed
your prior level.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a curiosity
of human physiology.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
lots of athletes

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:84%
drink those energy drinks
and eat those bars.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.230 align:middle line:90%
You've seen all these products.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Eat these bars or drink those
energy drinks full of sugar,

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and they do that to
restore liver glycogen.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.750 align:middle line:84%
That's how sugar is
stored in the liver.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But you have to renew
it every 30, 60 minutes

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:90%
to keep that flow going.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.000 align:middle line:84%
That's why they do it all
through a match, competition,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.770 align:middle line:90%
race, whatever.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.380 align:middle line:84%
When you stop
that, you no longer

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.140 align:middle line:84%
have all that glycogen to
draw from in your liver.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.013 align:middle line:84%
It's depleted within
about 40 minutes.

00:28:44.013 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
find yourself hitting

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.460 align:middle line:84%
a wall very quickly if you
try to run or swim or bike.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And so your body has
to kind of retrain

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:90%
itself to draw energy from fat.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And that process takes about
four to six weeks to amp up.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you get through that
period of poor performance,

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.847 align:middle line:84%
your performance will exceed, at
least match and usually exceed,

00:29:06.847 --> 00:29:08.180 align:middle line:90%
your prior level of performance.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.790 align:middle line:90%
You'll run faster.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:90%
You'll run farther.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:90%
You'll bike faster.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.540 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Novak
Djokovic, you'll hit harder.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, he seemed to
have gone through this

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:90%
without that kind of interval.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Some people do.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But the majority
of people will have

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.698 align:middle line:84%
that obligatory four to six week
period of decreased performance

00:29:24.698 --> 00:29:26.240 align:middle line:84%
before they get to
that better place.

00:29:34.872 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Wonderful, you
know, we need people

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:84%
like that in the public
eye, who kids look up to

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and the public looks up to,
to say these kinds of things.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing for a doctor
to say these kinds of things.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:47.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole other thing
for a Hollywood figure

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:49.983 align:middle line:84%
or a sports figure to
say, because people

00:29:49.983 --> 00:29:51.150 align:middle line:90%
will listen to those people.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.890 align:middle line:90%
They're playing it out.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.973 align:middle line:84%
They're showing to us that,
look what happens when

00:29:54.973 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:90%
you do these kinds of things.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But it opens up a whole
new book of problems.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we've built this
world of 7 billion people

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:90%
reliant on grains.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Now those of us who can afford
to do this in the developed

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
world can say, we're
not going to eat grains.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.900 align:middle line:84%
But I fear it's not a luxury
that you can take advantage of,

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.150 align:middle line:90%
say in Ethiopia or the Sudan.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Those people will always
be reliant on grains

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.540 align:middle line:84%
until we somehow
figure out a way

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.430 align:middle line:90%
out of this mess we've created.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.840 align:middle line:90%
It was an error in judgment.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:84%
There's nobody here at fault.
There's nobody we can blame.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years ago
we made the mistake

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.550 align:middle line:84%
of turning to the seeds
of grasses for food.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:90%
We can't blame agribusiness.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:34.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not fond of them.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe
we can blame them

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:84%
for introducing these
changes that they introduced

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:84%
for their own purposes,
pest resistance, increase

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:90%
yield per acre, et cetera.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:46.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's no one person
or industry to blame.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a confluence of
incredible blunders.

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But at the bottom of that is
this spectacular realization

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.500 align:middle line:84%
that, if you understand
this basic principle

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.430 align:middle line:84%
that it was a mistake and
you undo that mistake,

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that you can find
incredible health.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.550 align:middle line:84%
That even to this day, I'm
astounded at the conditions

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:84%
that reverse with
this lifestyle.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And every day, it doesn't
cease to amaze me then.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I do with my day.

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.280 align:middle line:84%
I talk to people
who have done this.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.080 align:middle line:90%
And they even look different.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the
facial inflammation

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:84%
of grain consumption
disappear, typically

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.980 align:middle line:90%
within the first week.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And people will
say, I only lost--

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I only lost three to
five pounds, or whatever,

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:84%
the first week, not
cutting calories,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:84%
not exercising, just not eating
grains and limiting sugars.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.410 align:middle line:84%
But their facial
structure will change.

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:42.230 align:middle line:84%
You'll see a deflation
of their cheeks.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.943 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the puffiness
around the eyes reversing.

00:31:44.943 --> 00:31:46.610 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the eyes
actually get bigger.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's an actual
transformation in appearance.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, it
provides this kind

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:84%
of anti-aging our
youth-preserving effect.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And typically, we'll see
this in lots ladies who

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:84%
are more open to sharing
their photographs,

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
that they look 10,
20 years younger.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful effect.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think it's an
easier question than we think.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:14.270 align:middle line:84%
It's revert back to the style
of eating that humans have

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:17.420 align:middle line:84%
followed for the first 2.5
million years of our time

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:22.230 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, before we got
it wrong 10,000 years ago,

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:84%
which is less than one half
of 1% of our time on Earth.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So the time we've spent
consuming the seeds of grasses

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:33.050 align:middle line:84%
is really a very brief time,
speaking anthropologically.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.150 align:middle line:84%
What if we revert
back to those foods?

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:39.080 align:middle line:84%
What did humans eat for
the first 99.6% of our time

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:90%
on Earth?

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, we killed animals,
ate their organs,

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.680 align:middle line:84%
ate the fat, shellfish,
fish of course,

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.680 align:middle line:84%
eggs, poultry, or
we killed birds.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.730 align:middle line:84%
We gathered plants, but not
seeds of grasses, not grasses.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.280 align:middle line:84%
We knew, instinctively,
they're inedible.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:84%
If we saw a field of
grass, we wouldn't

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.130 align:middle line:84%
start salivating because
it looked so yummy.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Fruit, of course, digging in the
dirt with our sticks and stones

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
for underground tubers
and roots, berries, nuts,

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:84%
the things that humans
instinctively regard as food.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.270 align:middle line:84%
If we can return to
a diet like that,

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:21.555 align:middle line:84%
we return to the health
of primitive people.

00:33:21.555 --> 00:33:23.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a common fiction that
primitive people die young.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.977 align:middle line:84%
That can be true from
injury and infection,

00:33:25.977 --> 00:33:28.310 align:middle line:84%
but they don't die of diabetes,
heart disease, dementia,

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and cancer.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So we get rid of the
diseases of civilization

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.690 align:middle line:84%
by returning to a diet to
which you have adapted.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:84%
To illustrate, I
often tell people,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.990 align:middle line:84%
if you see a insectivorous
toad, a toad that likes

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.420 align:middle line:90%
to eat insects, he's happy.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:84%
If you see a cow
that likes to graze,

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that's what it's adapted to
eating, grass and fodder.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:84%
What if you gave it,
instead, shellfish to eat

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.120 align:middle line:84%
or something it's
unfamiliar with?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:84%
It'd probably very
sick, quite quickly.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.390 align:middle line:84%
What if you don't like
the fact that lions

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:06.620 align:middle line:84%
kill gazelle and wildebeests
and gore them, eat their organs,

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and eat their meat
to survive, and you

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.790 align:middle line:90%
made them eat spinach and kale?

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:90%
You'd have a dead lion.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Same with humans, we follow
an adaptive script and diet.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you veer off that
script, funny things happen.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:22.250 align:middle line:84%
That funny thing could
be called obesity,

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:25.040 align:middle line:84%
it could be called type
2 or type 1 diabetes,

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
it could be called autoimmune
disease, it could be dementia,

I don't think anybody knows.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting observation,
these little pockets

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.485 align:middle line:90%
of exception.

00:34:51.485 --> 00:34:52.360 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I suspect they'll prove
to be genetically unique,

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.940 align:middle line:84%
that this kind of-- because
they're often very small

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
pockets of inbred
with some inbreeding.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I suspect
that they somehow

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.925 align:middle line:84%
acquired a protective
mechanism, genetic mechanism.

00:35:04.925 --> 00:35:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But to my knowledge, no
one's figured that out yet.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:10.690 align:middle line:84%
What I don't think we should
do is regard the exception

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.990 align:middle line:90%
as disproving the rule.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Because the rule applies
99.9 of the rest of us

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:90%

to profit from these mistakes.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Those mistakes could
be the consumption

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.450 align:middle line:84%
of the seeds of grasses, it
could be the over-reliance

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:43.150 align:middle line:84%
on sugary drinks because
of the very poor science

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that prove-- never
did, by the way,

prove that we need sugars
to perform in sports.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:90%
That's simply not true.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:84%
That we need gluten-free
foods, if we go gluten-free,

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that we need billions
and billions of dollars

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:84%
of prescription drugs to
deal with the diseases

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.390 align:middle line:84%
of civilization,
none of that is true.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The dirty little
secret is a lot of this

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.790 align:middle line:84%
is sustained because it
is hugely profitable.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It is hugely profitable
to be wrong and follow

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:17.500 align:middle line:84%
a diet low in fat, rich
in healthy whole grains,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.320 align:middle line:84%
take your statin drugs,
your blood pressure drugs,

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.130 align:middle line:84%
your acid reflux drugs,
your anti-depressants,

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:26.410 align:middle line:84%
drink your sports
drinks for keeping up

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:90%
performance in sports.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we've
created entire industries

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
that thrive on our mistake
that we've made as a species.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, what I find
is, more and more,

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.170 align:middle line:84%
the things that really pack
a wallop in restoring health,

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:84%
all make evolutionary
or adaptive sense.

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So to illustrate, if I said
you, eating no wheat or grains

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.932 align:middle line:84%
provides incredible
outsized benefit.

00:37:00.932 --> 00:37:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Why would that be true?

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, we didn't eat grains for
the first 99.6% of our time

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.020 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.980 align:middle line:84%
What if we said, vitamin D seems
second only to wheat and grain

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:84%
elimination as this
wonderfully powerful--

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:90%
why is that?

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, modern people
wear clothes.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:90%
We work indoors.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.273 align:middle line:84%
We've migrated far
north and south

00:37:21.273 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:84%
of the equator, farther
and farther away

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.430 align:middle line:90%
from direct sun, year round.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And the older we get, the
more longevity there is,

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.000 align:middle line:84%
the more we lose the capacity
to activate vitamin D.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.958 align:middle line:84%
And we don't like to eat
the organs of animals,

00:37:32.958 --> 00:37:33.860 align:middle line:90%
like the liver.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So for a variety
of reasons, we've

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.820 align:middle line:90%
lost our vitamin D status.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And restoring vitamin
D worked because it

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.630 align:middle line:84%
was something we should
have been getting all along.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So the things that really
pack a wallop in health

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.960 align:middle line:84%
are things that make, what
I call, adaptive sense.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.490 align:middle line:84%
As compared to say something
like, ashwagandha or turmeric,

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:90%
they can be beneficial.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But the benefits
are teensy-weensy

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:01.550 align:middle line:84%
compared to the huge benefits
of these very simple, adaptively

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:90%
appropriate strategies.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Another thing
happens when you put

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
this handful of adaptive
strategies together.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:13.280 align:middle line:84%
These are the strategies I
talk about a lot, wheat grain

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.180 align:middle line:84%
elimination, limitation
on sugars and carbs,

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:19.650 align:middle line:84%
omega 3 fatty acids
from fish oil,

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:22.290 align:middle line:84%
vitamin D restoration,
iodine supplementation,

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and a couple of others, a
cultivation of bowel flora.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:26.090 align:middle line:90%
You do all these things.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a lot, but
it's really not a lot.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.720 align:middle line:84%
You do all these things,
something even more incredible

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.700 align:middle line:84%
There is a very,
very powerful synergy

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.530 align:middle line:90%
among all those factors.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.980 align:middle line:84%
That collection of factors put
together, I call it 2 plus 2

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.510 align:middle line:90%
equals 11 effect.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It combines this
powerful synergy

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.213 align:middle line:84%
in turning around numerous
health conditions.

00:38:47.213 --> 00:38:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And so there's something
magical and wonderful

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.672 align:middle line:84%
about that combination
of strategies.

00:38:50.672 --> 00:38:52.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I'm seeing.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm always on the lookout for
other strategies we should add.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.143 align:middle line:84%
But now my litmus
test in deciding

00:38:58.143 --> 00:38:59.560 align:middle line:84%
whether we should
add new strategy

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is, does this work
in primitive humans?

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Did it work for the first
99.6% of our time on Earth.

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.322 align:middle line:84%
Or is it something put
there by somebody else

00:39:09.322 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:84%
because they think it
might be beneficial

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:84%
or some government guideline
says they're beneficial

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:90%
or somebody's profits from it.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So let's do things
because they really work,

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:22.110 align:middle line:84%
not because some ulterior
motive's entered the picture.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.038 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:25.038 --> 00:39:29.430 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, it become very
clear, you're right,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.120 align:middle line:84%
in the last few
years that we have

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.558 align:middle line:84%
managed to screw above
bowel flora colossally.

00:39:36.558 --> 00:39:38.600 align:middle line:84%
We've managed to screw up
a lot of things, right.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean you and me.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking about us,
as a society, as a species.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So when I was a kid, when we're
kids, you go out to a field,

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.670 align:middle line:84%
the field was filled
with grasshoppers.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.770 align:middle line:84%
I haven't see a
grasshopper in decades.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.832 align:middle line:84%
We wiped them out, or
nearly wiped them out,

00:39:51.832 --> 00:39:53.790 align:middle line:84%
because of herbicides
and pesticides and things

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:54.960 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So we've corrupted our
environment, global climate

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.460 align:middle line:90%
change, et cetera.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.330 align:middle line:84%
We've done the same in
our internal environment,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.600 align:middle line:90%
our microbiome, our gut flora.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Grains disrupt bowel flora.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Sugars disrupt bowel flora.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:13.470 align:middle line:84%
How about, occasional
antibiotics?

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.330 align:middle line:90%
They disrupt bowel flora.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:19.680 align:middle line:84%
How about antibiotic residues
or chlorine and fluoride

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:90%
in your drinking water?

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.560 align:middle line:90%
They disrupt bowel flora.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:27.000 align:middle line:84%
How about just the chemicals
that are in water and in air

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.040 align:middle line:84%
because your neighbor
was spraying his lawn

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.300 align:middle line:90%
with herbicide?

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Or the groundwater is still
contaminated with dioxin.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.265 align:middle line:84%
All these things
have contributed

00:40:35.265 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:90%
to changing our microbiome.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And the composition
of microbiome

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:41.770 align:middle line:90%
is essential for health.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.770 align:middle line:84%
The most dramatic
illustration of how far

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.770 align:middle line:84%
we've drifted in
our gut flora is

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.860 align:middle line:84%
when our gut flora
has been compared

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to the two primitive societies
who have been unaffected

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.950 align:middle line:90%
by antibiotics, grains, sugars.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.745 align:middle line:84%
And that's the Hadza in
Africa and the Matsés in Peru.

00:41:00.745 --> 00:41:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Now those are two
different continents.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:03.880 align:middle line:90%
They don't know each other.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't go to stores.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.270 align:middle line:90%
They don't go on the internet.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Yet they have very similar
bowel flora entirely different

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:10.170 align:middle line:90%
from ours.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.420 align:middle line:84%
They have species
we don't even have,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.870 align:middle line:84%
like spirochetes, that we
barely have any at all.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Yet, they are filled with them.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.068 align:middle line:84%
So it suggests that's the
true Stone Age bowel flora.

00:41:21.068 --> 00:41:22.860 align:middle line:84%
When you compare their
bowel flora to ours,

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:84%
it's clear we've drifted
very, very far away.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.998 align:middle line:84%
And so what's not
clear is whether we

00:41:28.998 --> 00:41:31.290 align:middle line:84%
have to go back all the way
to that kind of bowel flora

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:32.168 align:middle line:90%
to be healthy.

00:41:32.168 --> 00:41:33.960 align:middle line:84%
What I've been doing,
as a practical matter

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:90%
for bowel flora is remove--

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.073 align:middle line:84%
I encourage people think of
their bowel flora as a garden.

00:41:39.073 --> 00:41:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm going to
have a spring garden,

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to prepare the soil.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to plant my seeds
for cucumbers or whatever,

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.327 align:middle line:90%
tomatoes.

00:41:47.327 --> 00:41:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to water and
fertilize it for the season

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and then have a
wonderful little garden.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happens
in your bowel flora.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Prepare the soil.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:58.530 align:middle line:84%
That is taking away the things
that disrupt the garden,

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.700 align:middle line:90%
like chlorinated water.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Filter you water.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat grains.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat sugars.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Plant the seeds.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Seeds come in two forms,
multi-species, high-potency

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:11.780 align:middle line:90%
probiotics, those are helpful.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Though we're still even
unclear what species

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.020 align:middle line:90%
should be in there.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.700 align:middle line:84%
But you still get very good
products on the market now.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And fermented foods,
lactate fermented foods,

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.490 align:middle line:84%
like sauerkraut, and other
fermented veggies, and kefir,

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.290 align:middle line:90%
and yogurts.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:29.040 align:middle line:84%
You can even make yogurt with
coconut milk, so it's no dairy.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Those reseed the intestinal
tract with new species,

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.100 align:middle line:84%
like lactobacillus,
bifidobacteria,

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:90%
and leuconostoc.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, you have to water
and fertilize your garden.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Those are the prebiotic fibers
that microorganisms consume,

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.970 align:middle line:90%
but you can't.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:45.840 align:middle line:90%
You can ingest them.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.490 align:middle line:90%
But you can't digest them.

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:48.655 align:middle line:90%
And the microorganisms do.

00:42:48.655 --> 00:42:51.030 align:middle line:84%
That's what gets a bit strange,
a little bit complicated.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:55.108 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know,
modern people don't

00:42:55.108 --> 00:42:56.650 align:middle line:84%
want to go out into
the forest to dig

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:59.920 align:middle line:84%
in the dirt for underground
roots and tubers.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.275 align:middle line:84%
So I tell people
that because when

00:43:02.275 --> 00:43:04.650 align:middle line:84%
we talk about the source of
prebiotic fibers, people say,

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:04.930 align:middle line:90%
what?

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:90%
These are crazy.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.880 align:middle line:84%
They're green, unripe bananas
and raw, white potatoes,

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and inulin, and
fructooligosaccaride powders.

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And the point is, we're trying
to recreate for convenience

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.910 align:middle line:84%
what we should have
been doing all along,

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:23.940 align:middle line:84%
which is digging in the dirt
for roots and tubers and then

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.950 align:middle line:84%
consuming them, just at the
Hadza and Matsés still do,

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:27.970 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:33.005 align:middle line:84%
But modern life, frozen ground,
right, pressures of your life,

00:43:33.005 --> 00:43:33.880 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to it.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So we recreate them by consuming
these prebiotic fibers.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And health is taken
to another level.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Performance is taken to a higher
level by taking these efforts.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Bowel regularity, effortless.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.400 align:middle line:90%
No other fibers required.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.160 align:middle line:84%
You surely don't need cellulose
fiber, like in bran cereal.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:52.960 align:middle line:90%
That's nonsense.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.760 align:middle line:90%
That's just bulk.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.160 align:middle line:90%
That's like eating sawdust.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.690 align:middle line:90%
HDL cholesterol rises.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:43:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Triglycerides drop.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Blood pressure drops.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Blood sugar drops.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Insulin levels drop.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Visceral fat is lost.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.680 align:middle line:90%
You feel better.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.580 align:middle line:90%
Your thinking is clear.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.455 align:middle line:90%
Your dreams are deep.

00:44:07.455 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Your sleep is-- in other
words, this whole landscape

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:14.050 align:middle line:84%
of wonderful effects develops,
compounding the benefits

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.490 align:middle line:90%
of grain elimination.

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say there's this
wonderful, wonderful synergy

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that develops when you do
the entire package of some

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.680 align:middle line:84%
of these, what I call, adaptive
appropriate strategies.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.506 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:26.506 --> 00:44:31.220 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.290 align:middle line:84%
People who craft
nutritional guidelines

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:36.830 align:middle line:90%
fell into a trap of poor logic.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if you replace
something bad, white flour

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.310 align:middle line:84%
products, with
something less bad,

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:46.503 align:middle line:84%
whole grains with B
vitamins and fiber intact,

00:44:46.503 --> 00:44:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and there's an apparent
health benefit--

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:49.550 align:middle line:90%
and that's true, by the way--

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.040 align:middle line:84%
there is less weight gain,
less type 2 diabetes,

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.340 align:middle line:84%
less heart disease,
less colon cancer.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:57.830 align:middle line:84%
They concluded that a whole
bunch the less bad thing

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:90%
must, therefore, be good.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's apply that flawed
logic to cigarettes.

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:84%
If I said to you, these
full-tar, unfiltered cigarettes

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.770 align:middle line:90%
are terrible for you.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:08.450 align:middle line:84%
These filtered,
low-tar cigarettes

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:09.830 align:middle line:90%
are less bad for you.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And we showed there was maybe
less lung cancer from it.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Should we conclude
by that exercise

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.660 align:middle line:84%
that smoking a whole bunch of
low-tar, filtered cigarettes

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.100 align:middle line:90%
therefore good for you?

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It sounds stupid when
you play it out that way.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's the logic,
the flawed logic,

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:84%
used in the epidemiological
studies used

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.458 align:middle line:84%
to support the consumption
of whole grains.

00:45:30.458 --> 00:45:32.750 align:middle line:84%
The real question, the next
question, should have been,

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:34.300 align:middle line:84%
what happens when
you remove grains?

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you see the
astounding, spectacular things,

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:40.395 align:middle line:84%
already published, by the
way, in clinical trials.

00:45:40.395 --> 00:45:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have
to make this up.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Those trials are out there.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:46.500 align:middle line:84%
They're often not
regarded as being a proof

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.380 align:middle line:90%
of this grain-free lifestyle.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you take all grains and
sugars out of the diet and type

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:84%
2 diabetes goes away,
that's pretty good proof.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.450 align:middle line:84%
No studies have been
done, by the way.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, people who
craft dietary guidelines

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.160 align:middle line:84%
took that flawed
logic and said, it

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.190 align:middle line:84%
must mean that lots and
lots of whole grains

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:09.230 align:middle line:90%
must therefore be good for you.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So they got it so
colossally wrong that we now

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:90%
have a worldwide epidemic.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Because, unfortunately, a lot
of other agencies in the UK,

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Australia, Western Europe,
looked at the US dietary

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:84%
guidelines set the pace
because a lot of the research

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.470 align:middle line:90%
came from here.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we have, in effect,
in the US, exported

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:33.620 align:middle line:84%
type 2 diabetes, obesity,
and autoimmune diseases,

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and other conditions,
to other countries

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.350 align:middle line:84%
by this colossal
mistake we all made.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, I don't think
we'll ever hear

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.790 align:middle line:90%
a retraction or an apology.

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we'll ever hear
the US Department of Health

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and Human Services that drafts
the US dietary guidelines,

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.410 align:middle line:84%
nor the USDA, nor the
Heart Association,

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.400 align:middle line:84%
nor the Academy of
Nutrition and Dietetics,

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we'll
ever hear this.

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:01.100 align:middle line:84%
We made a mistake
on a grand scale.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Not only was our diet
advice ineffective,

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.802 align:middle line:84%
it contributed to the world's
epidemics of diabetes, obesity,

00:47:07.802 --> 00:47:08.760 align:middle line:90%
and autoimmune disease.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.927 align:middle line:84%
We're never going to hear
that because, particularly

00:47:10.927 --> 00:47:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in the US, there's lots of
litigation-hungry people, not

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:18.140 align:middle line:84%
to mention lost revenues
and contributions

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.580 align:middle line:90%
to some organizations.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think we'll ever
hear a retraction or an apology.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:25.010 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing is
happening already, by the way.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:30.158 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a
step-by-step pulling back.

00:47:30.158 --> 00:47:31.700 align:middle line:84%
About a year and a
half ago, we heard

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.940 align:middle line:84%
that there's really no need to
limit cholesterol in the diet.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Because there really was never
any data to show that anyway.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's no reason to
limit total fat in the diet.

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Which was a big revelation,
but it was so quiet,

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.100 align:middle line:90%
almost no one heard it.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But the Institute of
Medicine said, well,

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.350 align:middle line:84%
there's no need to
limit total fat.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So little by little, all
that awful advice that

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.850 align:middle line:84%
became the food pyramid,
the food plate, et cetera,

00:47:57.850 --> 00:47:59.030 align:middle line:90%
is being pulled back.

00:47:59.030 --> 00:48:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's being
done very quietly,

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I think to not draw attention
and fire and litigation

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and lawsuits, and
those sorts of things.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It may turn out
that in 50 years,

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.410 align:middle line:84%
we may hear national
agencies say, you know,

00:48:15.410 --> 00:48:17.018 align:middle line:90%
we've reviewed the science.

00:48:17.018 --> 00:48:18.560 align:middle line:84%
We're not sure you
should eat grains.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.670 align:middle line:90%
They're pretty darn toxic.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:21.337 align:middle line:84%
And you certainly
should not be drinking

00:48:21.337 --> 00:48:23.300 align:middle line:84%
those sugary, sugary
sodas and soft drinks.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.670 align:middle line:84%
You should be eating
real foods, rich in fat,

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.910 align:middle line:90%
including rich in saturated fat.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Make it organic
whenever possible.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.460 align:middle line:90%
We might hear that in 50 years.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But I think most of us, who
are eager for high performance

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and health, aren't
willing to wait

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:84%
for government
and other agencies

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.240 align:middle line:90%
to own up to their huge mistake.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Because this is something
you can do on your own.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:48.417 align:middle line:84%
You don't need your doctor to
go grain-free and sugar-free.

00:48:48.417 --> 00:48:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It's something you
can do on your own.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.125 align:middle line:84%
In fact, your doctor's
probably not as smart as you

00:48:52.125 --> 00:48:53.210 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to diet.

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:55.940 align:middle line:84%
We live in this age of rapid
information dissemination

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and open discussion,
social media,

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.543 align:middle line:84%
and sharing experiences
is wonderful,

00:49:00.543 --> 00:49:02.210 align:middle line:84%
while the doctor still
follows the stuff

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:04.673 align:middle line:84%
he learned 20 years
ago, 30 years ago,

00:49:04.673 --> 00:49:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and still thinks that
drugs and procedures are

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:08.270 align:middle line:90%
the only solutions to health.

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
revelation is that many

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:13.160 align:middle line:84%
of the diseases of
civilization are

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.010 align:middle line:84%
nothing more than the
evidence of the mistakes we've

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:18.050 align:middle line:90%
made as a society.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:20.512 align:middle line:84%
Let's undo those simple mistakes
and just reclaim health.

00:49:20.512 --> 00:49:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you, having done
this many hundreds of thousands

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:24.920 align:middle line:90%
of times, it's as easy as that.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.818 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:27.818 --> 00:49:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about how
gliadin is partially digested,

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.800 align:middle line:84%
the small peptides
that have opioid

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.405 align:middle line:90%
or opiate-like properties.

00:49:39.405 --> 00:49:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's where that
gets a little tricky.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And it took a long
time to be figured out.

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.490 align:middle line:84%
That's because the effect of
those gliadin-derived opioid

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:52.650 align:middle line:84%
peptides differ depending on
individual susceptibility.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:56.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a kid with autistic
spectrum disorder or attention

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:59.730 align:middle line:84%
deficit disorder,
those peptides can

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:05.210 align:middle line:84%
trigger behavioral outbursts
and erode your attention span.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're prone
to depression, it

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:10.040 align:middle line:84%
can trigger depression,
and suicidal thoughts, very

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.540 align:middle line:90%
powerful effect, by the way.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:14.780 align:middle line:84%
If you have schizophrenia, it
doesn't cause schizophrenia,

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.700 align:middle line:84%
it just causes you
to be more paranoid

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and hear more voices,
auditory hallucinations.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:24.680 align:middle line:84%
If you are prone to bipolar
illness or manic depression,

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:29.078 align:middle line:84%
you're more prone to have worse
highs of your bipolar illness.

00:50:29.078 --> 00:50:30.620 align:middle line:84%
If you have none of
those conditions,

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.290 align:middle line:84%
you're just an everyday Joe
without those conditions,

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:38.630 align:middle line:84%
it only triggers mind fog
and appetite stimulation.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We see that to the most extreme
degree of people bulimia

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:42.650 align:middle line:90%
and binge eating disorder.

00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Those people exposed
to gliadin derived

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.950 align:middle line:84%
opioid peptides have obsessive
relationships with food.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people
you find perched

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.190 align:middle line:84%
in front their
refrigerators at 3:00

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.800 align:middle line:84%
in the morning gorging
on the birthday cake.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So most of us don't
have those effects.

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But it is an illustration of
how the opioid peptides of wheat

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and grains have
peculiar effects that

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:07.160 align:middle line:84%
vary depending on unique,
individual susceptibility.

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And the majority
of those problems

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:13.814 align:middle line:84%
go away when you stop consuming
these things, easy as can be.

00:51:13.814 --> 00:51:16.778 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:16.778 --> 00:51:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want to be guilty
of that same mistake made

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.880 align:middle line:84%
by all government agencies
and other people who

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:26.930 align:middle line:90%
provide dietary advice.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if
something is less bad,

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.740 align:middle line:90%
it must therefore be good.

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.560 align:middle line:84%
So the grains, the
seeds of grasses,

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.470 align:middle line:90%
are all bad to varying degrees.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.890 align:middle line:84%
The worst of the worst, modern
high-yield semi-dwarf wheat.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.860 align:middle line:84%
A little less harmful,
traditional strains of wheat.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And other strains of
wheat-related grains

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.910 align:middle line:90%
like bulgur and triticale.

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Little less harmful, or
equally harmful, I should say,

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.890 align:middle line:84%
rye and barley because
they're so genetically closely

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:56.140 align:middle line:90%
related to wheat.

00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we get the corn,
oats, millet, sorghum.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.120 align:middle line:90%
They are also harmful.

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.940 align:middle line:84%
They're not as glaringly
harmful as wheat

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.730 align:middle line:84%
because the proteins
are not quite as toxic.

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:12.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, if a farmer allows his
cows to eat immature sorghum,

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:14.330 align:middle line:84%
a little bit not
fully ripened, they

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:15.710 align:middle line:90%
die of sudden cardiac death.

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not
talking about--

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.480 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about some
very serious effects.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:25.070 align:middle line:84%
But ripe sorghum, not quite as
toxic, but very indigestible.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:28.610 align:middle line:84%
All the agricultural
geneticists know this.

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:32.690 align:middle line:84%
We get all the way to the least
harmful, but not benign, rice

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:34.910 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about,
because it's mostly starch,

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:38.090 align:middle line:84%
very little protein, but still
has problems including arsenic.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know
of any grain that

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.620 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have some very
serious issues attached to it.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But I have to remind
everybody over and over

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and over again, never
view less bad as being

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:53.520 align:middle line:90%
necessarily the same as good.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think if we got
nutritionists and dietitians

00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:01.890 align:middle line:84%
that just embrace that single,
that single sequence of logic,

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:07.980 align:middle line:84%
you will see numerous errors in
nutritional science going away.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll see this
mistake being made over

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.988 align:middle line:84%
and over and over,
another mistake

00:53:12.988 --> 00:53:15.030 align:middle line:84%
that applies that sequence
of logic-- that flawed

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:16.290 align:middle line:90%
sequence a logic.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.290 align:middle line:84%
High glycemic index
foods are bad for you.

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Low glycemic index
foods, less bad for you.

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:24.630 align:middle line:84%
A whole bunch of low
glycemic index foods

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:26.490 align:middle line:84%
must, therefore,
be good for you.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they don't tell you
is what they should have said,

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.130 align:middle line:84%
high glycemic index
foods are bad for you.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Low glycemic index foods are
a little less bad for you.

00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But low glycemic
index foods still

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.430 align:middle line:90%
raise blood sugar sky high.

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So we never want to endorse
that awful logic of less bad

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:47.580 align:middle line:90%
being the same as good.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:90%
