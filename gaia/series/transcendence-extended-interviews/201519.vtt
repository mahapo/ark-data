00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
for "Food Matters."

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.172 align:middle line:84%
And I'm incredibly
honored to be here today

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:12.860 align:middle line:84%
with the Reverend
Michael Beckwith.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Reverend Michael is the founder
of the Agape Spiritual Center.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.190 align:middle line:84%
It is a non-denominational
community and gathering

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.017 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to raising the
vibrational awareness

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:84%
of the people in their community
and stretching that out

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:84%
to the world to create more
peace, love, compassion,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:90%
and harmony.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:84%
He is a spiritual leader
for the modern times,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.850 align:middle line:84%
helping us translate the
difficult nature of our being

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
into some simple practices
to help us thrive.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Reverend Michael, how are you?

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> James, it's my joy to
be with you, and thank you.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So we are living in what has
been called a WEIRD culture,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
a Western, Educated,
Industrialized, Rich,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:90%
and Democratic culture.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It has brought us many comforts,
material, wealth comforts,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and, yet, it seems was suffering
from a spiritual bankruptcy,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.612 align:middle line:84%
more anxiety and depression
than ever before.

00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
What are your thoughts
on what's creating

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:90%
this tension in our lives?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's often said that
we live in a high-tech,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
low-touch society, that we
have tremendous technological

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
advancement to do things
faster, to get places quicker,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:84%
but there seems to be a lack of
intentionality underneath that.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Often I say that we
live in an intention--

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
people are suffering from an
intention-deficit disorder,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and so just moving
through life, kind

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:84%
of reacting to
circumstances that

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.720 align:middle line:84%
are moving faster
and faster and faster

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
without any real
intention behind it.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Individuals are suffering
from the morose of consumerism

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:84%
and materialism and bereft of
a real vision of their life,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:84%
purpose of their life, the
reason for their incarnation.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you put all of that
together, there is moroseness.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:84%
There's people attaining
a lot of things,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
but still feeling sad,
suicide rate increasing.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it means
that, at some level,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
individuals have
forgotten their purpose

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:84%
and are not in touch
with the reason

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:90%
why they chose an incarnation.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
We did not choose an
incarnation to consume.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
We chose an incarnation to
share, to give, to shine,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
to radiate, to express,
to discover and cultivate

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
our giftedness,
and to express it.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Without that, then we get caught
up in the sea of mental garbage

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that is a part of the
phenomena of the world.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It is Indeed.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Well said, of course.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
areas where I think

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
creates a little bit of
paradox in this discussion

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:84%
is that we incarnate
into this body,

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and then we're
born into a family.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And we may be born
into a circumstance

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
or with parents that might
have some emotional trauma

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
from their childhood, and
they're subconsciously

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
using language or
behavior around us

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:84%
in a very important
formational time of our lives,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.240 align:middle line:90%
which may not be supporting us.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is happening here?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And how important is
those early stages

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the crafting
of the human spirit?

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, obviously,
it's very important.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
When we take an
incarnation, we're

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
imprinted immediately by the
environment in which we are in.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:84%
We're imprinted by
the conversations,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.990 align:middle line:84%
by the social
milieu, by whatever's

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
going on in society, whatever
issues our parents are having.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:90%
That's an imprint.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, in the
beginning, we learned

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:84%
how to survive with the
imprint, and then we

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
learn how to adapt
with the imprint.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, at some
point in our life,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
either through pain, suffering,
or through tremendous insight,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:90%
we learn to transform.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
We learn to go
beyond the imprint

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and to transmute the vibration
of those particular thought

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:90%
forms that are lodged within us.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a great
teacher that said

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that, I have come not
with a sword of peace,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.360 align:middle line:84%
but I have come with a sword
separating father from son

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:90%
and mother from daughter.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, I have
come to separate you

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
from your family
dynamic as your origin

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
so you can see that beyond
and before your family dynamic

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:90%
you have pristine nature.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where
spiritual practice comes in.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Individuals either
get sick and tired

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
because their experience is
being termed by the imprint,

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
or they have an
opening, an insight,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:84%
something happens,
they get inspired,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and they see that they're
beyond their parental fantasies.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
They're beyond
societal fantasies.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
They're something else.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But as you're saying, it's a
very important informative time

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
in our life that forges the
trajectory of our existence

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
for a while, until,
as I like to say,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
until we take our mind back
and begin to actually learn

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
how to transmute those
dynamics and go beyond it.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be really hard,
for some people, though,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.980 align:middle line:84%
in these circumstances, to
have this pressure of society,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.600 align:middle line:84%
this pressure of the parents to
study hard, go to university,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
get a good job, or, if you
have the accountant parent,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.790 align:middle line:90%
to go into finance.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And even though you might want
to follow your passion, how

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
do people manage this
struggle of wanting

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to follow their heart versus
trying to appease the family

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and society to do
the right thing?

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that is the pressure
everyone-- not everyone,

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
but most people do have a
parental fantasy that a parent

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.275 align:middle line:90%
has for their child.

00:05:41.275 --> 00:05:42.075 align:middle line:90%
It's a fantasy.

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the kid, the child,
gets caught up in the fantasy

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
and seeks to live the
fantasy of the parent.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So on one level, the
parent has to spiritually

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.220 align:middle line:84%
mature to the
point where they're

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
loving their child, setting them
free to discover their passion.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the role
of the child that's

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
growing until
adulthood is to have

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.310 align:middle line:84%
an awareness that the
parent had a fantasy,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.840 align:middle line:90%
but that fantasy isn't my life.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:90%
And so the pressure is real.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Those thought forms are real.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I share
often that the individuals,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:90%
they grow two ways.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
They grow through pain, or
they grow through insight.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
So when there's
enough angst or pain--

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I can remember a
gentleman that was

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
very pressured into
becoming a doctor.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:90%
His father was a doctor.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.630 align:middle line:90%
His grandfather was a doctor.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it was just assumed
he would go into medicine.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And he did until he
suffered from cancer.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of
healing the cancer,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
he fell back in love with
his passion, which was music.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:90%
He was a violinist.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And when he shifted
over to his love,

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
he not only healed his
cancer, but he found

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:90%
his calling, which was music.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
He was able to transcend
the parental fantasy.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it didn't
come without struggle

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
of a soul, pain of the
body, but he ultimately did.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's an extreme case.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But those cases exist
all the time-- someone

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
wanting to please their parent
or appease their parent.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, we all
have to be taught that there's

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
something about us,
something gifted,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.880 align:middle line:84%
something wonderful
as a calling.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a job, and
there's a calling.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a career, and
then there's a calling.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And when we can find our
calling, if it's our career,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:90%
that's a beautiful thing.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
If it's not, then our career
can support the calling.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Without an answering of the
calling, our soul is bereft.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:90%
It's sad.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:90%
It's morose.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I think our path
is to find our calling

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and to answer it.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I said
earlier, sometimes

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
the job you have with a career
you have is your calling.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Many times it's not.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Many times, your career, your
job supports your calling.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And so then you
have a nice paradox

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:84%
of the job or the career
supporting the calling,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.233 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
wrong with that either.

00:08:27.233 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> When you talked about the
soul going through this dark,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:84%
stormy sort of period, it brings
up your concept about the dark

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:90%
night of the soul, right?

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean about
that in particular?

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Traditionally, the dark
night of the soul is a moment

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
in which you lose all sense of
connection with the presence

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:90%
of the higher order of being.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:84%
What you formerly believed
it's gone out the window.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Your old identity has
begun to evaporate.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
The new identity
hasn't emerged yet,

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:84%
so you're in that
proverbial no-man's land.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And that can last for
a short period of time,

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
or it can last for a
long period of time.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.055 align:middle line:84%
And the dark night of the
soul, understand, is not--

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a dark
night of the soul

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
because someone died or you
lost a job or you got a divorce.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:90%
That's regular sadness.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the sadness of loss,
the sadness of somebody dying,

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
the sadness of a
structured life.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Dark night of soul is
something different.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle line:84%
You could have nothing
wrong in your life,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.735 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly
there's a bereftness.

00:09:37.735 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And that generally
means that, either

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
through grace or through
spiritual practice, past life

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
or present, your new
identity is emerging,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:84%
but it hasn't emerged yet, and
you're not who you used to be.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:90%
So you don't know who you are.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
what you believe.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the dark night, if
you can ask a question,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
such as, what quality do
I need to give birth to

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to have peace of mind if
this were to last forever?

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
You start to work with
something like that.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is that important?

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Generally, when an individual
is in a dark night,

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
they go through
wishful thinking.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I wish I wasn't here.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.070 align:middle line:90%
I wish I wasn't who I was.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd done
something differently.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd made
different decisions.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.103 align:middle line:90%
I made poor choices.

00:10:33.103 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
wishful thinking.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
None of those things
can ever happen

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.310 align:middle line:84%
because you are who you
are, you are where you are,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and this is what's happening.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
So to the degree that
you can pull yourself out

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
of wishful thinking and ask
a different kind of question,

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
when the dark night
is over, you found

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that you are a little bit
higher in your transformation

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't waste the
time asking futile questions.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I would wish
upon, anyone the dark night.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
However, every
mystic, in hindsight,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
loves it because
that was the moment

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:84%
that you were in that crucible
of darkness, that crucible

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:90%
of transformation.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And what you gain from it
is that you could actually

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:90%
see the light in the darkness.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The darkness shines
like the light.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
you come out of it.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.460 align:middle line:90%
You're really different.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:90%
You're more of yourself.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:84%
The mystic chord of
memory has been struck,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're remembering
who you are,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and it has nothing to do with
a change of circumstance.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:84%
It's an expanded awareness
of the ineffable presence

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:90%
that we all are.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to put something
in the words that's really

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:90%
very difficult to articulate.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Spiritual transformation is
not always easily translated

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:90%
in English, right?

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Any language.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.445 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:05.445 --> 00:12:07.820 align:middle line:10%
>> So one of the key things
you mentioned there was about

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:10%
asking good quality questions.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.910 align:middle line:10%
I think that is profound.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's
something that--

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:10%
I first got mention of this
idea from Tony Robbins in 2003.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:84%
He's like, ask a better
quality question.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, how can
that be profound?

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:10%
I know this is a big
part of your teachings.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:10%
Tell me how people can find
themselves using better quality

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:28.760 align:middle line:10%
questions to get
out of a situation?

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
What I teach as you want to
ask an empowering question.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And most people,
when they're going

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.920 align:middle line:84%
through something
that's debilitating,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:84%
they'll ask a
disempowering question.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:45.170 align:middle line:84%
They'll ask from a
victim state, why me?

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Who's to blame?

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.225 align:middle line:84%
In the mind, we just go rampant
with those kind of questions,

00:12:52.225 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
take you anywhere.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
They take you on
a downward spiral,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
or you will end up mining the
database of human consciousness

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
of all of the negativity that's
ever happened on the planet.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:84%
The why me, what's
wrong, who's to blame?

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
You're just pull in all the
frequency of all the suffering

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:90%
that's happening on the planet.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask an
empowering question,

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
a question such as, what good is
present that I cannot see right

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.370 align:middle line:84%
What's seeking to emerge
in my life right now?

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
What gift is being
born in me right now?

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:90%
What talent is being honed?

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:90%
What power is being cultivated?

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:90%
What's trying to unfold?

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:84%
What am I seeking to
give birth to right now?

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Because as you know,
when birth is happening,

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:90%
that's very intense.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a very intense period
of time in a woman's life

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:90%
and in the infant's life.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, we're always

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:90%
giving birth to something.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to ask a
different kind of question.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the deal.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
The universal presence,
by whatever name

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:90%
you choose to call it--

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I call the presence limitless
love intelligence, or presence

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:90%
that's never an absence.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:90%
It's life itself.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:84%
This universal presence,
through the universe

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and the universal law, will
answer any question you ask.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask
what's wrong, it'll

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
tell you all the
things that are wrong.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.020 align:middle line:84%
If you ask what's
trying to be born,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:84%
it will begin to
show you potential

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that's within you that's
seeking to emerge.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And when your attention
starts to shift more

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.670 align:middle line:84%
towards the potential
rather than the problem,

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
you begin to understand
a universal truth.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Potential is always
bigger than problem.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Your potential is always bigger
than any problem you're facing.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:90%
You start to see your potential.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you focus on that,
the answers from that realm

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:84%
start to come as guidance,
wisdom, transforming knowledge,

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous goodness,
insight, ahas, [GASP]

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:84%
perception changes, simply by
asking a question that empowers

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:90%
you rather than takes you down.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Moving from that
victim mentality up.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.865 align:middle line:84%
And to those questions,
in essence-- and this

00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
is more a question that's
coming out of this.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we tend to
attach meaning to so many

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.180 align:middle line:84%
experiences of
our life, and they

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
can be vastly
different depending

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.780 align:middle line:90%
on the sort of person.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it a question that changes
our meaning of a situation

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
from being, that happened,
and that was horrible,

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and that should
have never happened.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Or asking a better
quality question

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:84%
can shift that meaning
from victim to victor.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It changes the meaning,
but it changes our perception.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So the perception
of the victim is

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:84%
largely different
from the perception

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
of the individual that
is taking, having more

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.540 align:middle line:90%
dominion over their awareness.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the difference of looking
at life from the valley

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:90%
or from the mountaintop.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
at life in the valley,

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:90%
life is totally different.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
You see the obstacles,
hindrances, obstructions.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the top and able
to look down at everything,

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:90%
life is quite different.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask a
different kind of question,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:84%
your perception expands,
and you see life

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.120 align:middle line:90%
from a much wider expanse.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to make
more deliberate choices

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.650 align:middle line:90%
from that awareness.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
The trick is, in the
moment of your angst,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:41.240 align:middle line:84%
in the moment when it's
difficult, ask the question.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:90%
What's trying to be born here?

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:90%
What gift is trying to be given?

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you want to ask--

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to ask but
everything is going well.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:84%
But you want to ask the
question on such a regular basis

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:84%
that, when things seem
to be contracting,

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
you're still asking an
empowering question.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes a
practice, and then that

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:90%
becomes a way of life.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to develop
the capacity to deeply listen.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:84%
You're always in
a listening space.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.650 align:middle line:84%
You know the guidance
is here, wisdom is here,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:90%
direction is here.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
That underlying question
keeps your listening faculty

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:90%
acute and available.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, it seems talking
about a belief system--

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.430 align:middle line:84%
you believe that this
faculty is available.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
You believe that this divine
grace is all around you,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and you manifest
that in your life.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:90%
And that is true for you.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.542 align:middle line:84%
And that's certainly
been true for me

00:17:33.542 --> 00:17:35.990 align:middle line:84%
since opening up to
that type of awareness.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.970 align:middle line:84%
What beliefs could be
holding people back

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:84%
from acknowledging
that ultimate power?

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's two
things about believing.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
One, an individual's belief
determines their perception,

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.515 align:middle line:84%
and then their perception
determines their experience.

00:17:51.515 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So if an individual has
a belief that they're

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.370 align:middle line:84%
separate from the whole
or that they are flawed,

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.340 align:middle line:84%
there's something
intrinsically wrong with them,

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:84%
or they're an accident,
or there's something

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.860 align:middle line:84%
that they did in life
that they're never

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:84%
going to ever be
healthy or successful

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
because of some past mistake,
those are debilitating beliefs.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And they will form a
perception that will ultimately

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:90%
form an experience.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So believing is
only the beginning.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
As you establish a belief
system that you know that

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:90%
you're fundamentally whole.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:90%
You're not fundamentally flawed.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as an original sin.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:84%
That's made up by
humans, men primarily,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and that's seeking
to hold people

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of-- under
some kind of religious sway.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.690 align:middle line:90%
But you're fundamentally whole.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:84%
You're an eternal
being, spiritual,

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:90%
which means eternal, forever.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Infinite potential
lies within you.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So you establish yourself
in a belief system

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:84%
that's whole and corresponds
with the sacred truths

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.367 align:middle line:90%
with all paths of truth.

00:19:07.367 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Then, you have to
take a step further.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:90%
You can't just believe it.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Believing is as a poor
substitute for knowing.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I call it an operational
placeholder for knowing.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
What belief does is create a
framework for you to practice.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:90%
So you practice meditation.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:90%
You practice life visioning.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
You practice prayer, affirmative
prayer, not begging, a study,

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
fellowship with
high-minded people.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, what happens
is, you become a candidate

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:90%
for an insight, an aha [GASP].

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
you formerly believed,

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:84%
you're now coming
into knowledge about.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Ah, this is true.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I see it.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:84%
You're having an
encounter with it.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
If you stay at the level of
just believing, what happens

00:19:55.610 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:84%
is you suppress your doubt
about what you believe.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you
suppress your doubt,

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
you could become
a fundamentalist.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Because a fundamentalist
is a person that

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:84%
doubts what they
believe, and so they

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:84%
have to proselytize
and get large numbers

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and have everybody believe
the way they believe.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Or if other people don't believe
the way they believe, they're

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:90%
wrong, they're bad, you see.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.673 align:middle line:84%
And so believing without
having an encounter,

00:20:24.673 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:84%
you end up suppressing
your doubt,

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and that becomes a dark side.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And so belief is to
frame your practice.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in the Golden
Rule, you practice it.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you at
one with all of life,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:84%
you develop a practice
where you have

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.870 align:middle line:84%
an insight around that
until you no longer have

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:90%
to have a belief.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:90%
You know something.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe water is wet.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:90%
I've tasted it.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in the
law of aerodynamics.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I've been on a plane.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.890 align:middle line:90%
So I don't--

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe it, and
I'm going to go--

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:84%
No, it's a substitute
placeholder

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.880 align:middle line:90%
into you know something.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there are beliefs
that are holding people back.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I call it riding your
bicycle with the brakes on.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.742 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to go forward,
but you have this belief

00:21:12.742 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:90%
you're not good enough.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.200 align:middle line:90%
You're unworthy.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.540 align:middle line:90%
You were an accident.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.430 align:middle line:90%
You're separated from life.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.130 align:middle line:84%
These are all-- that there's
not enough good to go around.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:90%
We live in a limited universe.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Abundance is only for a few.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
We had these
limited beliefs that

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
then form actions that allow
us to try to manipulate

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:84%
the external world
to get what we

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:90%
want based on a faulty belief.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a belief that
is in tune with universal truth

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a practice
until you know something,

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:90%
and then you radiate it.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:90%
It speaks truth to me.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I got given a
belief from someone

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.120 align:middle line:84%
who has given it to him
by a spiritual teacher.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was everything has
absolutely always unfolding

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And I believed it.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:90%
I believed it.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I believed that until
I experienced it.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And once I experienced
it, I never

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:90%
believed that it was truth.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It is truth.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.945 align:middle line:90%
>> It's truth, right?

00:22:12.945 --> 00:22:15.467 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's an interesting
and profound idea.

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:16.800 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't put those two together.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer a belief.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:19.640 align:middle line:90%
It's my experience.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
We live in a more connected
and yet more disconnected

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:middle line:90%
time than ever before.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.260 align:middle line:84%
You touched on
that just briefly.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one
of the things that's

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.605 align:middle line:84%
been common amongst
a lot of the people

00:22:29.605 --> 00:22:32.870 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken to when it comes
to understanding the psyche,

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:84%
it seems there is a
tidal wave of lack

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.232 align:middle line:84%
of self-worth permeating
just about everybody.

00:22:41.232 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And we go on social media,
and someone's always

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.790 align:middle line:90%
more beautiful.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:90%
Someone's always got more money.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.163 align:middle line:90%
Someone's always got this.

00:22:46.163 --> 00:22:48.560 align:middle line:84%
It seems so much more
difficult now than ever

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:90%
before to believe in ourselves.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Did someone create this?

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.020 align:middle line:90%
It seems well orchestrated.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Or do we tend to default
to a limited state,

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:90%
a limited self being?

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Or is that something that we can
blame on our family heritage?

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Where is this
self-doubt coming from?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The blame is always, always
place blame on ignorance

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%
and not on a person.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
But with the advent of
social media, particularly

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.570 align:middle line:84%
the young folks that
are coming up now,

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:18.920 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to find their
self-love in likes and people

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.400 align:middle line:84%
commenting or saying
beautiful things about them.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And conversely, they go down
if somebody disagrees or them.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the upside of technology
is, I call it a global brain.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to
touch anyone anywhere

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
on the planet instantly via
computer, via phone, via Skype,

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.440 align:middle line:90%
via Zoom, via Instagram.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the global brain.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, what has to
be developed is now

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:84%
the global heart where the
sense of love and compassion,

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:84%
integrity begin to pervade
in our environment.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
But right now, the dark side of
it it's taking a lot of people

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And you have people that,
in their inauthentic nature

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and cowardice, will say
things about people hiding

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
under a pseudonym that they
wouldn't say to a person

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.410 align:middle line:90%
to their face.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But they'll attack someone
for what they believe

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
or what they say or what
they're wearing or whatever,

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.940 align:middle line:84%
whether it's another
political view.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.257 align:middle line:84%
They'll go into a
real visceral attack.

00:24:29.257 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And if they were to see
that person on the street,

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.650 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't do that.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it connects
us, but then it

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.713 align:middle line:84%
can cause a level-- it can
be the template for a level

00:24:40.713 --> 00:24:43.130 align:middle line:84%
of separation because people
would do things they normally

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't do, you see.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that we have to
let our young folks come back

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to an awareness
that their self-love

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.550 align:middle line:84%
and their self-esteem,
they're not the same thing.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:25:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Self-love is the fact that
you're loved by the presence

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:90%
because you're alive.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to earn it.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.450 align:middle line:90%
You're just loved.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.743 align:middle line:84%
Self-esteem comes
from acts that-- when

00:25:08.743 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
you learned to tie your shoe,
ah, I leaned to tie my shoe.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:90%
I've got a level of self-esteem.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:90%
I learned to walk.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.623 align:middle line:90%
I got self-esteem.

00:25:13.623 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:90%
I learned how to read.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I've got self-esteem.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Self-esteem is based
on accomplishment.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.655 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes,
in our society,

00:25:21.655 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to develop
people's self-esteem,

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:24.590 align:middle line:90%
but not based on acts.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.780 align:middle line:90%
It's just not the same thing.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have to come back to,
one, having people really,

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
honestly want to
grow and evolve,

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.300 align:middle line:90%
fall in love with themselves.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And then find their way
in the world with the way

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.670 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
express themselves.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And two, when I was coming
up, in elementary school,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:90%
we got grades for citizenship--

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.100 align:middle line:84%
how well you
interacted with others,

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.810 align:middle line:84%
how well you took care
of the environment

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:84%
you lived in,
whether you picked up

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:90%
litter or put your chair back.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Were you able to
sustain a dialogue

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.355 align:middle line:84%
with someone that disagreed with
you without making them wrong?

00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
That was in elementary
school, and that

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:13.600 align:middle line:90%
was called citizenship.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not there as much now.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Now people are pushed for
some kind of pseudo success,

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:24.480 align:middle line:84%
some kind of gain of some
kind of material stuff,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.100 align:middle line:84%
but the citizenship
vibe is gone.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So you throw that into a
social media where there's

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:39.100 align:middle line:84%
no teaching of kindness,
no teaching of walking

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
in another person's
shoes, seeing life

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:47.100 align:middle line:84%
from another person's
perspective, love.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%
No one talks about that.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about love.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:90%
We have an issue.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing it
running amok in technology.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And so right now, technology
has outpaced, to a degree,

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.040 align:middle line:84%
our development, our
psychological and spiritual,

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.580 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.143 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to catch
up, not as individuals.

00:27:10.143 --> 00:27:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we all
know individuals

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
who are living a very wonderful,
generous, creative, kind life.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But the masses, technology
has outstripped their devotion

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:84%
for their growth,
development, and unfoldment.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.870 align:middle line:90%
There has to be a shift there.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's hope that
Agape can help.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and Agape,
that's what we seek to do.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:39.070 align:middle line:84%
We've been in existence now
celebrating our 33rd year

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.460 align:middle line:90%
this year.

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I first pulled
together a vision group

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.340 align:middle line:84%
to establish Agape, one of
the things that came out

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.690 align:middle line:84%
was, we wanted to be the
example of the next stage

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:90%
of human evolution.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:84%
We didn't just want to
start a spiritual community.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:84%
We actually wanted to be the
beings that represented what

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:84%
love looked like, what
kindness looked like,

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.300 align:middle line:84%
what diversity and inclusivity
looks like, and of course,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:90%
establish a spiritual community.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.090 align:middle line:84%
But it was always about, we
have to become this first.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And Agape seeks to
carry that vibration.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel it.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And also your strict adherence
to non-denomination as well.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we call it
trans-denominational

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
because the word trans
means to go beyond,

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.280 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond something,
and to cut through.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:38.350 align:middle line:84%
So we go beyond
denominations into truth.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Nobody has a monopoly on it.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:90%
So we go beyond--

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:84%
because this
presence is infinite,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.322 align:middle line:84%
so it can't fit
into a denomination.

00:28:49.322 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, it's all here
in the kitchen.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It transcends denomination.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It's transcendence.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a trans-denomination
in the spiritual community.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And so that that's why
everyone's at home here.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Muslim, Jew, Jewish, Christian,
Buddhist, Sikh, atheist,

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.580 align:middle line:90%
whatever--

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.970 align:middle line:84%
because the qualities
of love and peace

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and harmony and joy,
wisdom, no religion

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:90%
has a monopoly on that.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.680 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to
be vehicles of it.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So people are at
home, and they come

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
because we're not trying to
force them back into a box

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.310 align:middle line:84%
that everyone's
trying to get out of.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:37.575 align:middle line:84%
>> It's at a pivotal time
in the evolution of religion

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:39.700 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people
falling away from religion.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's wonderful,
what you're doing.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing an increase
in people seeking out

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:84%
other types of
spiritual practice,

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.490 align:middle line:90%
in particular meditation.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Being around when
yoga was first--

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:55.915 align:middle line:84%
seeing the early
stages of that--

00:29:55.915 --> 00:29:57.790 align:middle line:84%
for me, especially,
being at that early stage

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
with "Food Matters" of, like- we
were talking about goji berries

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.693 align:middle line:90%
and spirulina in 2008.

00:30:01.693 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:84%
You already knew about
this, Reverend Michael.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I know that, but
now it's everywhere.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is gluten-free,
dairy-free, paleo.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And the next story is
evolving our consciousness.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.760 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.210 align:middle line:90%
However, when we talk to--

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.370 align:middle line:84%
you've spoken to practice, this
idea of practice meditation.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.160 align:middle line:84%
You said something about
a sweat a type of prayer

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
where you're not coming from
a place of begging or lack.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to what
types of practices

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:84%
we can work on to evolve
our vibrational level

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and also to create a
greater sense of inner peace

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:32.460 align:middle line:90%
and self-worth?

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Of course, meditation
is the foundation.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I describe meditation as
paying undistractable attention

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:45.150 align:middle line:84%
to Reality, capital R,
not passing phenomena.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you establish your
intention to wake up,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to expand your awareness
to who and what you are.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the moment
of meditation is

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:02.040 align:middle line:84%
when you have that moment
of connectedness to life

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and you learn how to pay
undistractable attention to it.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is all manner
of debris, thoughts forms,

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.290 align:middle line:84%
whatever may be flowing
through your mind,

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:18.240 align:middle line:84%
but you're learning to have
dominion over your attention

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.670 align:middle line:84%
so that, as the
insight is occurring,

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.400 align:middle line:84%
you're able to be aware
of it and have a level

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.650 align:middle line:90%
of stabilization around it.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's meditation.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are many, let's
say, techniques of meditation.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, meditation
is about paying

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:84%
undistractable
attention to reality.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So you have
contemplative meditation,

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
you have existential
meditation, and you

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.860 align:middle line:90%
have spiritual meditation.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Contemplative meditation is
when you read, read Rumi,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:90%
read Dr. Howard Thurman.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And you read and
you contemplate.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:57.000 align:middle line:84%
You meditate until you
distill the truths out of it.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.790 align:middle line:90%
It becomes, ah, a part of you.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And there's
existential meditation.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.590 align:middle line:90%
We meditate on your existence.

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:14.280 align:middle line:84%
The W's-- who am I, why
am, where am I, when am I?

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Until you start to be
taught, not just to belief.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But you start to
have an insight.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm an emanation of
the great work what?

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm a unique expression
of the holy presence.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Why am I?

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.230 align:middle line:84%
To reflect and to
reveal this presence

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.490 align:middle line:90%
according to my uniqueness.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:33.570 align:middle line:90%
When am I?

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.775 align:middle line:90%
So that's existential.

00:32:36.775 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And spiritual meditation
is when you're

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.610 align:middle line:90%
meditating simply to wake up.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:45.435 align:middle line:84%
You're establishing your
intention to wake up,

00:32:45.435 --> 00:32:47.310 align:middle line:84%
to have a greater
realization of your oneness

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
with life, whether you call
life god or the presence of love

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.520 align:middle line:90%
or intelligence.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But whatever the technique
is, it's fundamental,

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.500 align:middle line:90%
it's fundamental.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And then affirmative prayer
is not begging or beseeching.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:10.110 align:middle line:84%
You're actually praying to
have a realization of what

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.460 align:middle line:90%
you're praying for.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.470 align:middle line:90%
You already have it, you see.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So we enter into a
state of gratitude.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we begin to
recognize the presence that's

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:26.670 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, begin to feel
our unity with this presence,

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and then we proclaim
or declare what

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.170 align:middle line:84%
is so, whether it's about
our abundance or our health.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.620 align:middle line:84%
We give thanks that
it's already done,

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and we'll release
it into the law.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.792 align:middle line:90%
It becomes our new law of being.

00:33:39.792 --> 00:33:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I went through
those stages very fast.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But the individual
would sit and actually

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:90%
pray to have that awareness.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.620 align:middle line:84%
There's the life
visioning process,

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:56.190 align:middle line:84%
the process by which we use to
bring Agape into incarnation.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Non-profits and
corporations and individuals

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:84%
use the life visioning
process all around the world

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:06.510 align:middle line:84%
to actually get a sense of
what is it within us that's

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:90%
trying to come forward.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:84%
It's different
from visualization.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is
a good practice.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an entry-level practice
of seeing what you want,

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:18.480 align:middle line:84%
feeling it, declaring
it, articulating it,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.900 align:middle line:84%
coming into a resonance
with it until it manifests.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, people
are visualizing things

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:28.009 align:middle line:84%
that society told them they
should want to be happy.

00:34:28.009 --> 00:34:30.179 align:middle line:84%
Then when they get
it, they're not happy.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.489 align:middle line:90%
So visioning is different.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:34.469 align:middle line:84%
Visioning is an
awareness that there's

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:84%
something intrinsic within
you, that no one else

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.370 align:middle line:90%
has the way you have it.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going back
to empowering questions.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.130 align:middle line:84%
You're able to ask,
what is the vision?

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And you sit until you're
able to feel it or hear

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:90%
it articulate it.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.909 align:middle line:84%
You ask, what is it
that I need to become

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.290 align:middle line:90%
to manifest this vision?

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.720 align:middle line:90%
That's growing edge.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Where do I need
to go in my life?

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:84%
What do I already have they can
be in service to the vision.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to let go
of that no longer serves

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.170 align:middle line:90%
my moving forward?

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Tap into a sense of willingness.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.870 align:middle line:84%
This is all a part of the
life visioning process,

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:19.570 align:middle line:90%
which is saying, in substance--

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:90%
you take an avocado seed.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Avocado seed can't become
a daffodil, a magnolia.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.320 align:middle line:84%
What's intrinsic to the avocado
seed is an avocado tree.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So there's something within
us that's intrinsic within us.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And we ask until we begin
to see, what is my gift?

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:43.420 align:middle line:90%
What is my passion?

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And we walk in that direction.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So like visioning
is very important.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.545 align:middle line:84%
You want to develop a
practice of high conversation.

00:35:52.545 --> 00:35:53.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
talk about what

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to experience.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So that eliminates gossip,
and eliminates complaining.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin
to have conversations

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:07.600 align:middle line:84%
with high-minded people
about vision and possibility,

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:90%
or you be quiet.

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't get caught in the
rough and tumble nastiness

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that human beings get caught
up in talking about each other

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.070 align:middle line:84%
or putting people down or
tearing people apart or passing

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.720 align:middle line:90%
rumors along.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.480 align:middle line:84%
That is going to get
on the person that's

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.610 align:middle line:90%
doing that, you see.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this
right conversation.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's all manner of
spiritual practice, you see.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Affirmation and
declaration, it's

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:43.330 align:middle line:84%
all a part of honing
our attention so we're

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.760 align:middle line:84%
able to see better,
so we're not just

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.280 align:middle line:84%
seeing life through
the filters that we've

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.305 align:middle line:90%
inherited from the imprints.

00:36:50.305 --> 00:36:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But we're starting
to see life as it is.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.520 align:middle line:90%
It's pristine.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.150 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.950 align:middle line:90%
It's luminous.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:58.990 align:middle line:84%
It's full of infinite
possibilities,

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:90%
infinite opportunities.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.080 align:middle line:84%
We can just see
it the way it is.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And then we walk
in that direction.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Things appear.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Opportunities show up, doors
open, we meet the right people

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.200 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The divine conspiracy,
we become a part of it.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.240 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.558 align:middle line:84%
>> To conspire with,
to breathe, with right?

00:37:24.558 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.082 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that came up in an
interview I just did recently

00:37:29.082 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:84%
with Sir Ken Robinson-- he's
the gentleman that talks about

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.850 align:middle line:84%
our education systems and
how structured they are,

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.530 align:middle line:90%
so you know Ken.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about this idea of
creative play, being creative

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and how, when you're
creative and playing

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:45.210 align:middle line:84%
or music or dancing, or for
me it's surfing or swimming,

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:84%
you become more
open to possibility.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.337 align:middle line:84%
Is that also a spiritual
practice in a way?

00:37:49.337 --> 00:37:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it sounds like that's
what you're talking about.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Play and pray have a
very similar vibration.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.050 align:middle line:90%
When you were a kid--

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and now, obviously, as an
adult, we want to maintain this.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You play, but there was no
attachment to an outcome.

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.313 align:middle line:84%
That got serious later when an
adult put rules to it and said,

00:38:09.313 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:84%
you're going to win, and
you're going to lose.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But when a kid is
just playing, there's

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.330 align:middle line:84%
no attachment to the
outcome, and they're fully

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.880 align:middle line:90%
vested in the play.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And when they're fully
vested in the play,

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:84%
in that moment of creativity,
they're in a zone.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:84%
They're in flow motion
as I like to call it.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're in prayer,
it's the same thing.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.200 align:middle line:84%
You have no attachment
to the outcome.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:84%
You're just connecting to this
vast wisdom and storehouse

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.710 align:middle line:90%
of love and presence.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And you're allowing the outcome
to form based on the play

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:90%
or on the pray.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:45.880 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.750 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to
tell people if they

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:84%
don't play an instrument
or don't do a sport

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.470 align:middle line:84%
or don't sing, they're
not creative, no.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.590 align:middle line:84%
You can be creative
with anything.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Just shift your
mindset and enter

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:90%
into the flow of creativity.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is here to be soulful
artists, soulful artists.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you're
vacuuming a rock,

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:84%
washing a dish, writing a song,
doing something that's tedious.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.430 align:middle line:84%
When you enter into it
from the spirit of play,

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
you get the universal
plus factor.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Something else ah,
gets added to it,

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and you find yourself, after
a while, witnessing yourself

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:28.500 align:middle line:90%
do it.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a very powerful state.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed, it is.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we need
kids to remind us of that.

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.120 align:middle line:90%
The kids will lead us.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.350 align:middle line:84%
>> They will lead us to
our spiritual development,

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.820 align:middle line:90%
which is 100% true.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Many of us, even though
we have this resonance

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:53.157 align:middle line:84%
with your message, can still
carry around fear, fear of--

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
but if I do that, if I
take that action, what will

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.040 align:middle line:90%
people think of me?

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Or fear, if I meditate,
maybe my parents

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:84%
think I don't believe
in Jesus anymore.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:84%
How do people break
through these fears?

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.395 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to understand this.

00:40:07.395 --> 00:40:09.880 align:middle line:84%
This is what I want
to tell folks is

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.930 align:middle line:90%
that you're damned if you do.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.150 align:middle line:90%
You're damned if you don't.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:19.690 align:middle line:84%
That, once you start
walking down this path,

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:90%
people will talk about you.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's say you're working
on a project, and you're afraid.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid it's going to fail.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:31.527 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid it's
not going to work.

00:40:31.527 --> 00:40:33.370 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
laugh at me if I fail.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you do "fail," which is
the learning, people will talk.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.560 align:middle line:84%
If you succeed, they're
going to talk about you.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They're going to talk
about you either way

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.495 align:middle line:84%
because mediocrity
attacks excellence.

00:40:47.495 --> 00:40:48.370 align:middle line:90%
So they're going to--

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:84%
so knowing that you're going
to be talked about either way,

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:56.950 align:middle line:84%
you don't live your life
with what other people are

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:90%
thinking as your consideration.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:04.450 align:middle line:84%
That's where much
anxiety comes from.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.840 align:middle line:84%
People are taking too
much into consideration

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.230 align:middle line:84%
when others are
thinking about them.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
others are more concerned

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.200 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
thinking about them.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.252 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is living
in this false narrative

00:41:16.252 --> 00:41:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that people are thinking about
what they're thinking about,

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.970 align:middle line:90%
and they're not.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the first
ways that you grow

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:26.282 align:middle line:84%
is that you let the
they go, and you

00:41:26.282 --> 00:41:28.240 align:middle line:84%
become aware that there's
something within you,

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.040 align:middle line:84%
the great, I am, the
singular manifestation

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:84%
of a cosmic goodness
within you, that

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:90%
becomes what you listen to.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, with
practice, meditation

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.480 align:middle line:84%
like visioning et cetera, that
becomes the predominant voice

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:90%
you hear.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.990 align:middle line:84%
You don't even hear
the other voices.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And then you're able to
look at the two impostors

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and treat them both the same.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:55.340 align:middle line:84%
The imposter of praise and
the imposter of criticism.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.390 align:middle line:90%
They're impostors.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:57.640 align:middle line:90%
You don't live for either one.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.070 align:middle line:90%
You're not trying to get praise.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You're not running
from criticism.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You're living your
passion of the gift that

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.700 align:middle line:90%
wants to come forward.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.070 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, people are anxious.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.650 align:middle line:84%
They're anxious
about the future.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.720 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of what
people are thinking.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Again, spiritual practice
allows you to be very present.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:20.860 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things
I share about fear

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:24.250 align:middle line:84%
is people sometimes
spend a lot of time

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:90%
trying to get rid of it.

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:27.880 align:middle line:90%
It's futile.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.670 align:middle line:90%
You take it with you.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:90%
It is knowledge.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's fear here.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take the
first step anyway.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm afraid.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's fear here.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I take the next step.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:42.430 align:middle line:84%
What happens is everything
is this energy based

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.672 align:middle line:90%
on thought forms.

00:42:44.672 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:84%
So you're afraid, you're
afraid, you're afraid.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.100 align:middle line:90%
You keep taking the steps.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.633 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is fear gets
transmuted into excitement.

00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:54.800 align:middle line:90%
It's another form of energy.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a higher form of energy.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you keep
walking, excitement

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.330 align:middle line:90%
gets transmuted into enthusiasm.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So you've gone from
fear to enthusiasm

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.810 align:middle line:84%
by walking in the
direction of your dreams.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So you don't let
it stagnate you,

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:90%
nor do you try to get rid of it.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000 align:middle line:90%
You just acknowledge it.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's fear here.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there's fear.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing something
you've never done before,

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.870 align:middle line:84%
you're stepping into the
unknown, the egoic structure,

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:84%
which does not know
the difference between

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:29.980 align:middle line:84%
self-actualization, or
enlightenment, or awakenness,

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.420 align:middle line:90%
or transformation--

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:35.310 align:middle line:84%
there's no difference between
that and annihilation.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.930 align:middle line:84%
It projects fear
onto everything.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So you walk, fear
becomes excited.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, I'm excited them
I'm enthused, Oh.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.890 align:middle line:90%
You never know if you don't go.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, one belief
I adopted early on

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.120 align:middle line:84%
was, when you step up to serve,
many resources and things

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.120 align:middle line:90%
become available to you.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And I only had to
believe that for so long

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:90%
until it got proven true.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It's absolutely true.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.000 align:middle line:84%
The universe supports
your movement

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:90%
and supports your thought.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.815 align:middle line:90%
It supports your actions.

00:44:07.815 --> 00:44:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
doing anything,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.367 align:middle line:90%
then you get no support.

00:44:11.367 --> 00:44:13.450 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things you
mentioned I want to touch

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.540 align:middle line:10%
on before we get to the closing
question is this idea of, you

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:20.020 align:middle line:10%
said you get unattached
to the criticism.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But you also get
attached to the praise.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.340 align:middle line:90%
That is a very profound thing.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we have been brought
into a world where love

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.640 align:middle line:84%
is a condition upon
activity in many ways.

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I will love you.

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I love you son.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Good job with the
grades you got.

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:37.940 align:middle line:84%
I love you, if you
got into university.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.210 align:middle line:90%
It's love.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.010 align:middle line:90%
It's connection.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.490 align:middle line:90%
It's pure.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.573 align:middle line:84%
It's what we want, but it
seems to be conditional.

00:44:42.573 --> 00:44:45.275 align:middle line:84%
How do we divorce ourselves
from this conditional love trap

00:44:45.275 --> 00:44:47.630 align:middle line:84%
that we've allowed
ourselves to play into

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.220 align:middle line:84%
and we often play
into the world?

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It is conditional.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And we inadvertently
get caught up in it.

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:84%
No one's doing anything
inherently wrong.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But as we mature, there is an
unconditional non-agenda love.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:09.362 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
we're seeking to be.

00:45:09.362 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what our
practice is leading

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:84%
us to so that no one loses your
love if they make a mistake.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And you don't give more love
because they've done better.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's unconditional, non-agenda,
all-conditional kind of love.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.630 align:middle line:90%
That emanates from the spirit.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't will
yourself into that.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.840 align:middle line:90%
That's not willpower.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not mental might--

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to love
unconditionally, no.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:37.910 align:middle line:84%
That comes from practice of
affirmative prayer meditation

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:42.200 align:middle line:84%
until the debris around
the mind gets cleared up.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Then you find yourself loving.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.243 align:middle line:84%
And since we're
talking about that,

00:45:49.243 --> 00:45:50.660 align:middle line:84%
as we mature in
our loving, here's

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:54.710 align:middle line:84%
another profound
thing we discover.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:57.950 align:middle line:90%
No one can stop you from loving.

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.920 align:middle line:84%
All they can do is help
create the tributary

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.330 align:middle line:90%
of the frequency of love.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's done
something to you,

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:84%
they can't stop you
from loving them.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.580 align:middle line:84%
They just provide the
context for forgiveness,

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.780 align:middle line:84%
which is a form of
love or compassion

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:18.860 align:middle line:84%
or kindness or
patience or intimacy.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.560 align:middle line:84%
There's different
tributaries of this love.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.050 align:middle line:84%
But then, as you
really mature, you

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.830 align:middle line:84%
discover you don't need
an object for love.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
objectify ourselves.

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.280 align:middle line:90%
We just love.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
we find that we're

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:36.360 align:middle line:84%
able to be in love
with nothing there,

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.110 align:middle line:84%
and then the universe brings
into our field individuals

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and circumstances and
things around the world

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.950 align:middle line:90%
that need our love.

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:middle line:84%
That's a very mature
state because most people

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:53.490 align:middle line:84%
are operating on I love that,
or I love him, I love her.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And then they circumscribe
their love to just their kin.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But they're not mature enough
yet, spiritually mature enough

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:05.870 align:middle line:84%
yet, to just love, to just
be in the flow of love.

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you can
love with no object,

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:11.030 align:middle line:90%
that's a very high state.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is where the
human race is seeking to go.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.880 align:middle line:84%
A long way to go
before we get there,

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.480 align:middle line:84%
but that's what
we're seeking to go.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I've met some people that
seem to have touched that

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.040 align:middle line:84%
divine state, very few,
two or three in my life.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're just pure love,
pure nonjudgment, pure joy,

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.670 align:middle line:90%
pure nonreaction to--

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:37.170 align:middle line:84%
they're not reacting,
they just are.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:41.580 align:middle line:84%
This is, as you
say, and so it is.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.600 align:middle line:90%
They just are.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be you get
magnetized to their presence.

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:49.170 align:middle line:84%
You're like, wow, this
person really knows it.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet, most of
our modern world,

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:57.420 align:middle line:84%
we have this chase, this
fight, this separateness,

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.440 align:middle line:90%
this competition.

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And we finally reached
the top of that hill,

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and then we're burnt out,
stressed out, depressed,

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.050 align:middle line:90%
anxious.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:06.708 align:middle line:84%
We've got five houses
around the world,

00:48:06.708 --> 00:48:08.250 align:middle line:84%
private jets,
everything, and they've

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:10.830 align:middle line:90%
reached a spiritual bankruptcy.

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.740 align:middle line:84%
How can people-- this is
really my last angle here.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:16.350 align:middle line:84%
How can people find more
fulfillment and passion

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and meaning in
their lives, really,

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:21.600 align:middle line:84%
to achieve that state
of that spiritual person

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.300 align:middle line:84%
that I mention as opposed
to the spiritual breakdown

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.500 align:middle line:90%
of this other person?

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> To go beyond competition and
comparison, which are deadly--

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
immature competition.

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.640 align:middle line:84%
At one point, you have to
ask, how can I be of service?

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Service is the great
opener of the heart.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:46.428 align:middle line:84%
And you discover that service
is also a path to awakening.

00:48:46.428 --> 00:48:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
after you are awake?

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:49.410 align:middle line:90%
You serve more.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a continual
being of service,

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:55.950 align:middle line:84%
awakening, being of
service, and awakening.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:84%
That particular
question would transform

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:04.200 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational frequency of
many businesses, corporations,

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.540 align:middle line:84%
organizations, if we
maintain our service ethic,

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.000 align:middle line:84%
rather than our acquisitive--
trying to appease

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.770 align:middle line:90%
our acquisitive appetite.

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I want more of this, I want
more money, I want more of this.

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:18.600 align:middle line:90%
How can I serve more?

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Then into that frequency, then
the other things are given--

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.550 align:middle line:84%
greater prosperity,
greater opportunities,

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:28.380 align:middle line:90%
which comes greater prosperity.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I think that, again,
coming back to citizenship,

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:36.918 align:middle line:84%
global citizenship,
how can I serve?

00:49:36.918 --> 00:49:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a question
people need to ask themselves

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:40.440 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And what they'll
discover is they

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.140 align:middle line:84%
begin to tap into an
inexhaustible energy.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:45.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not them.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not, I'm going to
burn myself out serving.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not martyrdom.

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to
serve until I can't

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.207 align:middle line:84%
give any-- no, no no, that's
not what we're talking about.

00:49:53.207 --> 00:49:56.370 align:middle line:84%
When you ask, how
can I be of service,

00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:00.510 align:middle line:84%
the energy that flows through
you is of service to everyone,

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.420 align:middle line:90%
and you get the first bite.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.350 align:middle line:90%
It feeds you first.

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:10.020 align:middle line:84%
This is why all of the different
research and test after test

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:12.930 align:middle line:84%
after test have shown that
people who are of service

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:14.230 align:middle line:90%
are more happy.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:17.010 align:middle line:84%
They have long-term
joy when they're

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.500 align:middle line:84%
living a life of
service and generosity

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.680 align:middle line:84%
rather than individuals who
are living a life of feeding

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.570 align:middle line:90%
their acquisitive appetite.

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it gives,
going back to meaning,

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.150 align:middle line:84%
gives you life more
meaning, doesn't prevent you

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:33.828 align:middle line:84%
from having fun, doesn't prevent
you from being successful,

00:50:33.828 --> 00:50:36.120 align:middle line:84%
doesn't prevent you from
having wonderful relationships

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and friendships.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:44.460 align:middle line:84%
No, it just makes your life
wider, bigger, more luminous,

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.700 align:middle line:90%
wah, how can I be of service?

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:52.450 align:middle line:84%
That's an empowering question
we all have to ask every day.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.750 align:middle line:84%
Reverend Michael, thank
you so much for your time.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:56.820 align:middle line:90%
So grateful.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:57.960 align:middle line:90%
You've been a true giver.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're of service every day,
and I feel it in your being,

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:00.970 align:middle line:90%
so thank you.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:01.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for the
work you're doing.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.450 align:middle line:10%
