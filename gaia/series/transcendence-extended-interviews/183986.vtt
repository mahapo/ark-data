00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So I grew up with two
immigrant Indian parents that

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.470 align:middle line:84%
came to America really trusting
of the American food system,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and really wanting
to be American.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And so me and my
brother growing up,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
we could eat whatever we
wanted when we were little.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So if I wanted McDonald's,
I got McDonald's.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted Wendy's
or Burger King,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I would get those Happy Meals
every single day if I wanted,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:84%
because it was cheap, it
was readily available,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and it was food
that we were eating.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:90%
I was really picky child.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to eat the
home-cooked Indian meal

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
my mom was making for
herself and my dad.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:90%
It looked funny.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:90%
It smelled funny.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I'd known
what I know now

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
about all the medicinal
curries and the health

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.870 align:middle line:84%
qualities of
vegetarian cooking, I

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
would be a totally
different person.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:84%
But I really think I had to get
through that stage in my life

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:84%
to get to where I am today and
to make the impact that I'm

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:90%
making today.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Because as a result of my
terrible food habits growing up

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and my lack of education
about nutrition,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
it led to a lot of
different health issues.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And those health issues,
overcoming asthma, eczema,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
allergies, endometriosis,
having my appendix taken out,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:84%
all of those episodes of
being in and out of hospitals

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and doctor's offices
really created passion

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
in me to start taking
back control of my health,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and to make it a
priority to figure out

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:90%
what I'd been doing wrong.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I started to question
all the things that I'd

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:84%
been taught about
food and started

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
to do my own research into
what was truly healthy,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:90%
my mind was blown.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I found out that
the majority of food

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been eating for
most of my life was dead,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:84%
processed food, that
it had been invented

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:84%
in a laboratory full
of different chemicals,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:84%
largely not even
tested for human use,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:84%
just approved by
the manufacturer

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
themselves instead of the FDA,
no one really even looking

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:90%
over these chemicals.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And that I was eating this
non-food in abundance.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And no wonder my body was
sick, because it wasn't getting

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:90%
the nutrients it needed.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started to
make radical changes, started

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.590 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the amount of
processed foods in my diet,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
started to eat a whole
plant-based, organic, whole

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
foods diet, my body
completely changed.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I get off all
of my prescription drugs,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
which I was on eight at
one point in my life,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I, for the first time, was
able to maintain my weight

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.550 align:middle line:84%
without dieting, really try
to take a hold of my energy,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
started to feel better than I've
ever felt in my entire life.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was a way of
life that I couldn't

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
believe that other people
were not following.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
shouting everything I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
was learning through the
rooftops to my friends,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
through my family,
and they started

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:90%
calling me the food police.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.163 align:middle line:84%
They were really upset
when I'd go to their houses

00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and start looking
through their pantries

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and pointing out all of the
different chemical additives

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that they were eating and what
those chemical additives were

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:84%
doing to their body and all
the risks associated with them.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they had
enough, and so I said, well,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.280 align:middle line:90%
why don't I start a blog?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.272 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I share
this information

00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:84%
that I'm learning
to the people who

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
really are the willing, the
ones who want to change.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I started
doing that, not only

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:84%
did a lot of my
friends and my family

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
get on board as a result,
but we created a movement.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was working in
the corporate world

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
at the time in a very
high-stress, six-figure job

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
where I was reporting
to C-level executives

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:84%
at some of the biggest financial
institutions in the world.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, at home,
when I'd get home from work,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I would literally not watch
TV, gave up television

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:84%
so that I could research and
write and share information

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:84%
about the chemicals
in food, and what

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I was learning about
the food industry,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and what I was doing with my
own body, and all the recipes

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:90%
I was making at home.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I started to realize
that that passion for getting

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.050 align:middle line:84%
people to stop their
suffering, because I

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
had suffered so much
in my life and really

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
my mission was to
stop unnecessary

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:90%
suffering all of a sudden.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And I realized my job,
my six-figure salary,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
my way of life in
that corporate world

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:84%
had such little meaning
compared to helping

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:90%
people end that suffering.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
a year and a half

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
after starting the blog,
quit my job cold turkey,

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
was not making any money
being the Food Babe

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
or writing as the Food
Babe under this name,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:84%
because I really wanted
to hide my identity.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want my
bosses to figure out

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.865 align:middle line:84%
who I was or anyone
else for that matter.

00:05:16.865 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I was really scared
to be online.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I was never on social media
even before starting the blog.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.725 align:middle line:84%
And so you just
weren't on social media

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:84%
as a corporate citizen, because
you didn't want your boss

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:90%
to find your personal pictures.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't spend time
on Facebook and Twitter

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:90%
as a corporate citizen.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And so for me this
was a whole new world.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is as soon
as I started to really branch

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
out and tell people who
I am after I quit my job,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:84%
things started to
happen magically.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I take on
one of the largest food

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:90%
manufacturers in the world--

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Kraft Food-- for
the artificial food

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:84%
dyes that they were
using in their products,

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
but I suddenly became a
spotlight, a feature all

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
over the news internationally
for this work,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and started to highlight issues
about the ethical and moral

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:90%
standards of food development.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.938 align:middle line:84%
For example, we found out that
one of my first investigations

00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
that I did as soon
as I quit my job--

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly I
had all of this time--

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
was to compare products being
sold in the United States

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:90%
to other parts of the world.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that our
own American companies

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
were reformulating
our favorite products

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to be healthier for
citizens overseas and not

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:90%
for their own Americans.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And one product was Kraft
macaroni and cheese,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:90%
which in Europe, if it has--

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
if a product has
artificial food dyes,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
it says may cause adverse
effects on activity

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:90%
and attention in children.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, Kraft Foods
had figured that out,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
said we're not going to put a
warning label on our products

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:90%
overseas.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.460 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to take out
that artificial food dye.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And that stance to only
take out artificial food

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
dye for some citizens
across the globe

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and not all citizens
across the globe

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.960 align:middle line:84%
is completely immoral
and unethical.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if they know that
there is an ingredient that

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:84%
could be risky to children, or
could be harmful to children,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
or contribute to ADHD, or
contribute to hyperactivity,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I think food corporations
have an obligation

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
to make their products as
healthy across the board.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And so pointing out
that discrepancy

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:84%
opened up a Pandora's box of
food activism and social media

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:84%
frenzy of moms and
dads and everyone

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
sharing this information
so voraciously to the point

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
where these
corporations couldn't

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:84%
do anything but listen
to us and start to remove

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.020 align:middle line:90%
some of these chemicals.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
The majority of food
products in grocery stores

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
are manufactured for
one reason only--

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:84%
to increase profit
of food companies.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
food companies that

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.860 align:middle line:84%
are ruling the food
industry are actually

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:90%
American-based companies.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So they rely on
capitalistic mentalities

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and so their purpose is to
make as much money as possible.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you have that driving
your goals as a food company,

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to come back
and make health a priority.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
Because health is real,
natural, whole foods that

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:90%
have very little processing.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:84%
And it's cheaper to make
artificial food dyes than use

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:84%
dyes from beets, and
carrots, and strawberries,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:90%
and blueberries.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And the food industry
has figured this out

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and they've hired very
intense scientists

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:84%
to figure this
stuff out for them.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the same scientists that
created addiction in tobacco,

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:84%
they've hired to create
addiction in food.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And so they're using
our brains and the way

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
our body responds to
food to their advantage

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to continue for us to
be addicted to really

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:90%
super cheap processed food.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're in this never-ending
cycle of purchasing this food,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:84%
thinking we're
going to get full,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.845 align:middle line:84%
but we're really
empty on nutrition.

00:09:18.845 --> 00:09:22.016 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:22.016 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that
I really want people to do

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is completely ignore
the marketing of food.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.612 align:middle line:84%
All of the fancy
buzzwords they put

00:09:32.612 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
on the front of the package--

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
the low-fat, low-calorie,
gluten-free--

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
all of those things--
forget about it.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:84%
You have to look at
one thing and that

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:90%
is the ingredients in food.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
recognize an ingredient,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:84%
you need to put the
product back on the shelf

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:90%
or learn about that ingredient.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think informed consumers
are the most beautiful part

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
of this catalyst of change
in the food revolution.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Because once you become aware
of how processed our food is

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and what chemical
additives the food industry

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.790 align:middle line:84%
has invented to
put in our foods,

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.060 align:middle line:84%
you do not want to be part of
that experiment any longer.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.560 align:middle line:90%
You want to opt-out of that.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to bring in
those chemical additives

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:90%
to your family every single day.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to be a mom
and I know I'm not

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.450 align:middle line:84%
going to feed my child these
chemical additives that

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.740 align:middle line:84%
have been invented
in the last 50 years,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:84%
largely to do one
thing, which is

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
to improve the bottom
line of the food industry.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
They're not invented
to improve our health.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
What I would like to do is
challenge the food scientists

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:90%
of today.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Find ingredients and
find ways to make

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
food improve our health, not
just improve the bottom line.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:45.253 --> 00:10:48.680 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I started to
look into why we've been so

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
conditioned to think that we
need a Gatorade or a Powerade

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
after a workout,
or why athletes are

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
reliant upon these
different concoctions

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.350 align:middle line:84%
in order to perform, I found
out that over 40 years ago

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.760 align:middle line:84%
the sports drink industry
actually paid scientists

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
to convince moms and convince
the public that their child

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:84%
would not be hydrated enough
during regular sports events,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
that their child needed
this extra nourishment,

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and that without it you were
putting your child at risk.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.690 align:middle line:90%
That is absolutely false.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
children out there

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
who do sports activities need
one thing and that is water.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And it goes even greater than
the sports drink industry,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
into the soda industry
and to the big names--

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Pepsi and Coca Cola--

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
who have paid scientists
over the years

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to say that diet soda and
diet drinks are better

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:90%
for people than actual water.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's absolutely
false, too,

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:84%
because when you look
at a lot of these sports

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
drinks and performance
drinks, they

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.950 align:middle line:84%
have artificial
sugars in them, they

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:84%
have artificial ingredients
that not only wreak havoc

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
on hyperactivity in
children, but they also

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.220 align:middle line:84%
wreak havoc in your brain and
how your brain processes sugar.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you think you're
getting sugar, but not actually

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:84%
getting sugar, your brain starts
to crave more and more sugar.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So you're in a never ending
cycle of obesity at that point.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
we have to change.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:39.110 align:middle line:90%
We have these really--

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.760 align:middle line:84%
when I look at the
grocery store shelf

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and I see the array of all the
different colored sports drinks

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and what's actually in
them, I completely cringe

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and I can't believe that
athletes and children

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
across the nation at schools
and at sporting events, as well

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
as doctors giving it to
children when they're sick,

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.120 align:middle line:90%
and having it in hospitals.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, having all of
these different chemical

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:84%
compounds in a drink to try
to make someone feel better

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.970 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make any sense.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely robs
the body of nutrition.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's synthetic
vitamins in there.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:90%
There's artificial ingredients.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
There's-- the amount of sugar
in there is not what the body

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:90%
really needs to handle.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:84%
We need water to hydrate
and we need that message

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:90%
to be heard across the world.

We have athletes pushing
these chemical concoctions

to little kids.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Sports drinks full
of artificial food

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
dye-- artificial food
dye that's linked

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:90%
to hyperactivity in children.

Hyperactivity that's now leading
to more increases in ADHD.

I can't tell you how many
parents I have spoken to

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and have received
letters from, when

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.950 align:middle line:84%
they remove these artificial
food dyes from their child's

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:84%
diet, how much their
attention improves,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:90%
how they get better at school.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:84%

allergies go away.

Their skin issues go away.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Because these artificial
food dyes not only

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
are linked to
hyperactivity, they're

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:84%
linked to all sorts of
different allergies in kids,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:90%
as well as in lab rats--

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:90%
leukemia.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the blue number one
coloring is linked to leukemia.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
You look at the Center for
Science and Public Interest,

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
a group that is out of
Washington DC, who's

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.460 align:middle line:84%
made it their life's
mission to research

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:84%
the science behind
these chemicals,

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and they've lobbied for the ban
of these chemicals from the FDA

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:40.840 align:middle line:90%
for so long.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken parents and
regular everyday citizens

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:84%
to rise up and decide not to
purchase these artificial food

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
dyes to really get
manufacturers to listen.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.562 align:middle line:84%
to really understand
what these chemicals are

00:15:04.562 --> 00:15:05.395 align:middle line:90%

So one of the most famous food
chains in the world is Subway.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:90%
Their motto-- eat fresh.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you really look
into the ingredients-- when

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I decided to say, why is it that
I don't eat that food anymore?

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:90%
It just tastes process.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to look
into the ingredients.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the ingredients I found
was called azodicarbonamide.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
mouthful of an ingredient.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the same
chemical that they use

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.210 align:middle line:90%
in yoga mats and shoe rubber.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And I found out this chemical
was banned all over the globe--

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Australia.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.850 align:middle line:84%
They'll fine you
and put you in jail

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.350 align:middle line:90%
if you use it in Singapore.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.520 align:middle line:90%
It's banned in Europe.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And I found that Subway wasn't
using this chemical overseas,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
but was using it in other parts
of the world where they got

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
away with it, where
their governments

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and their regulatory
agencies were lax

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and allowed this chemical
in the food supply.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I decided to
start a petition on Subway

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to remove this chemical, it
wasn't so much about this one

chemical.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
It was really to
highlight the fact

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%
that we've all been hoodwinked.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
We thought we were eating
fresh, when really we weren't.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And so many other fast
food chains out there

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.700 align:middle line:84%
are getting away with
this misleading marketing.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And finally, given this
example and the way that Subway

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:84%
responded to this campaign
by immediately agreeing

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
to remove this chemical, it
showed the American consumer

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and it showed the
people worldwide

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.420 align:middle line:84%
who read the press and
the worldwide coverage

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
of this campaign that
they need to look

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:84%
into the ingredients
of what they're eating,

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and really understand
what they're eating

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.705 align:middle line:84%
and ignore the marketing from
these major food corporations.

You know as a mom-to-be,
I'm really concerned

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
about the marketing
to children because I

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
hope that I can create a really
great, positive, healthy food

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:84%
environment at
home for my child.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as my child
leaves this house, it's over.

everything from television

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:26.900 align:middle line:84%
to school fundraisers
to advertising

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.860 align:middle line:84%
in the weirdest of places,
there is a constant barrage

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
of pressure from
the food industry

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:84%
to get kids to adopt
their latest products,

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.080 align:middle line:84%
because that's their
newest customer.

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:90%
They want children.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.670 align:middle line:84%
They want the young people
to be addicted to their food,

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
so that their taste buds get
accustomed to those processed

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
ingredients, that
hidden MSG that's

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:84%
in just about every
processed food, and all

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
of those different invented
ways to use chemicals together

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.620 align:middle line:90%
to create addiction.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to
parents really to try

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.240 align:middle line:84%
to educate children about
the chemicals in food

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and teach them about
ingredients very early on.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.330 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to really
teach my daughter

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
one day about all of
the chemicals in food

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that so that she can
read ingredient lists

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:90%
from the moment she can read.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And she'll know what
artificial food dyes are

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and she'll know what these
different chemicals in food

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.230 align:middle line:90%
are doing.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.147 align:middle line:84%
And so she can look at
the back of the package

00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and make a decision for herself,
and make an informed decision.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And she might choose to
still eat those Skittles,

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:84%
like most kids would,
but at least it's

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
going to be an
informed decision.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is the best
hope that I can do,

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:84%
because when I look
back at my childhood,

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about these chemicals.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And to have that
knowledge, and to be

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:84%
able to give that knowledge
and spread that knowledge

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
through children is going to
be the most impactful thing

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:90%
we can do.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is what's
going to help them

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:90%
break free from the marketing.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.360 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be able
to call out the bullshit

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to
be exciting to watch.

I screamed from the rooftops.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:84%

We've been hoodwinked
about sugar.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:84%
We've had companies
who rely on sugar,

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
like the big soda
companies, paying scientists

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.060 align:middle line:84%
to say that saturated fat
was making us unhealthy,

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
causing heart disease, causing
obesity, and not actual sugar.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And so our eyes have been off
the ball for many, many years,

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:90%
having a different villain.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:84%
But really the villain
has been sugar.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And to think that
sugar is being added

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to 80% of processed
foods on the market,

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that that
sugar is directly related

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to diabetes, heart disease,
obesity, autoimmune disorders,

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.760 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of diseases,
we have an obligation

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to do something to
educate the public

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:90%
about the dangers of sugar.

And one way to
educate the public

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
to do that is through tax, just
the way cigarettes are taxed

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:90%

sense to do that,

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:84%
but I think something
grander needs

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:90%

is that all disease

to create little tiny
holes in your gut

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and leak out good
bacteria, and when

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
we're eating these
carbohydrates in abundance,

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:84%
our gut are
completely destroyed.

One of the most beneficial
ways to start paying attention

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:84%
to our guts is to add foods that
create a healthy environment

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:90%
for bacteria--

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:41.630 align:middle line:84%
probiotic foods like fermented
kimchi, and tempeh, and miso,

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:90%
and sauerkraut.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And start to put prebiotic
foods in your diet like radishes

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and radicchio and all of
these beautiful vegetables

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know what to
do with but they actually

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
add a component to your gut
and your digestive system

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.860 align:middle line:90%
to make it all work beautifully.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%

paying attention

shelves everywhere

things are being formulated
to include probiotics.

They're adding probiotics
to a lot of things.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is similar to
what the food industry did

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.600 align:middle line:84%

vitamin D deficiency or calcium

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:90%
deficiency.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
They started adding
it to orange juice.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the true way
to get these probiotics.

You really have to
go back to basics,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and create foods that
are fermented naturally

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:90%
and are healthy through--

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
fermented cabbage that comes
through kimchi, or sauerkraut,

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:84%
or a yogurt that is
fermented naturally

processed to death

to go gluten-free.

food industry has figured out

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
a way to make more
money in this industry,

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.350 align:middle line:84%
because they realize people are
feeling better when they reduce

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:84%
the amount of wheat in their
diet and gluten in their diet.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:84%

industry.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So they've figured
out how can we

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:84%
make gluten-free foods
without wheat and gluten

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and still get people to buy
these cheap hyper-processed

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:90%
foods.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they've
created these products

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:84%
with low quality ingredients,
high starchy ingredients that

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
raise the blood sugar
just as much as some

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:84%
of the wheat and
gluten products.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And they've increased the
amount of additives in them

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:90%
to make them work together.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Different stabilizers
like carrageenan

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:84%
that's linked to
intestinal issues and IBS.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
They add all sorts of
other types of additives

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:90%
to keep it shelf-stable.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's stuff we just
don't want in our body.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're going
gluten-free to be healthy,

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.345 align:middle line:84%
don't rely on the food industry
to create products for you.

00:25:35.345 --> 00:25:36.145 align:middle line:90%
Go back to basics.

00:25:36.145 --> 00:25:38.875 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:38.875 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's different.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:84%
We all require
different nutrients.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are
not created equal.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And so there isn't really
one diet for everyone,

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
but there are some principles
that do work for everyone.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is, we don't need
processed food in our diet.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:84%
We do not need the cookies,
the cakes, the chips, the soda,

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:90%
in order to survive.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
We need whole, real, natural,
plant-based, animal-based foods

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that have come from the earth,
that nourish us naturally.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
ideal diet for anyone

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to follow to immediately
start to feel better.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Your diet is not working
for you if you're

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
in a never-ending cycle of
losing weight, gaining weight,

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:90%
losing weight, gaining weight.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.980 align:middle line:84%
When you're on the diet
that's ideal for you,

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.440 align:middle line:90%
eating becomes effortless.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.510 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a way of life.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Your cravings are stabilized.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Your body is full of energy.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Your reliance on outside
prescription drugs

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:90%
starts to diminish.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Your reliance on outside
therapy start to diminish.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And you realize you can
get just about everything

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:90%
you need from food.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.385 align:middle line:84%
And until you get to that
point, I say keep experimenting.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:11.628 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Once you start to get in
a rhythm with good food,

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.480 align:middle line:84%
you want to start to
achieve a level of health

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that you never
thought was possible.

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And one way to do that is
start to work on your mind.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And benefits through
exercise, through meditation,

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:84%
through yoga, can really take
your health to another level.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And for people who really
want to become well,

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that is another
avenue to really start

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.550 align:middle line:90%
to achieve everlasting health.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And whether you start there
and then you go to food

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:84%
or you start with food
and then go there,

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really matter because
it all starts to meld together.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And overall wellness has
that big mind component.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can tell you right now
if I didn't have a strong mind,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able to
do the work that I'm

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.090 align:middle line:90%
doing now in the food industry.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able to take
on these corporate giants

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.440 align:middle line:84%
had I felt sick, or felt bad, or
wasn't taking care of my stress

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.050 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety levels through
meditation, and yoga

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and exercise.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And now that I've been able to
achieve this level of health,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.390 align:middle line:84%
it's not only helped
me personally,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's helped me become
more successful, and reach

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.740 align:middle line:84%
more people, and create a
higher calling for myself.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So when I started Food Babe it
was really kind of an accident

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.390 align:middle line:90%
that I became an activist.

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.920 align:middle line:84%
The goal of the
blog was to really

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.013 align:middle line:84%
just teach people about what was
happening in the food industry.

00:28:52.013 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea the food
industry would actually

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
react, and actually take
out some of the ingredients,

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and start to make major changes
and overhauls to their product

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:84%
lines as a result of
what I was writing.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And when they did
start to respond,

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I realized I had
a higher calling

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
in this world than to work
in the corporate world.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It was really to take
on this new challenge

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:90%
of changing the food industry.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And at first I was
super scared, because I

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.180 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the courage to
let go of those principles

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:90%
that I'd been in--

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that had been
instilled in me since I

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:36.110 align:middle line:84%
was very young from my parents,
which was you need a 401(k),

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:40.400 align:middle line:84%
you need a steady job, you need
a salary in order to survive.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was a very ambitious
person and I had a great job.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And to give that
up for the unknown

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:90%
was a very tough thing to do.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But I eventually did it
and I made the decision

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
actually on the
top of Machu Picchu

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.330 align:middle line:90%
during a Christmas vacation.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I made the decision,
I looked over at my husband

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:04.340 align:middle line:90%
and I said, you know this is it.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to quit
when I get back

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do this
Food Babe thing full time.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take
on the food industry.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And I expected him to say,
well, what about your salary?

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.782 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to survive?

00:30:18.782 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to be
able to make it?

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Instead he said, what
have you been waiting for?

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And everyone around me was
encouraging me and cheering me

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.150 align:middle line:84%
on, and it was
really me that I had

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to make that decision for myself
and I had to find that courage.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I did find that
courage and when I came back

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.170 align:middle line:84%
from that vacation in January,
where I'm sitting on the couch

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:43.085 align:middle line:84%
like surrounded by the
buildings I used to work in

00:30:43.085 --> 00:30:46.430 align:middle line:84%
in downtown Charlotte of all
these financial institutions,

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and not having a boss,
not having a paycheck,

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and going, oh my gosh, I've
got to figure this out,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I've got to figure out
what I'm doing here.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.610 align:middle line:90%
It was a very scary time.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I started to
focus 100% of my energy instead

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:84%
of just part of my
energy on this mission,

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.280 align:middle line:84%
things started to
change dramatically.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Not only did some of the largest
food corporations in the world

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.490 align:middle line:84%
start to change as a
result, we built an army,

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:14.720 align:middle line:84%
a movement of people out
there who care about what's

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:84%
in their food and
holding these companies

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:90%
accountable for their actions.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's changing the food
industry faster than ever.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I can't in a million
years think that I would ever

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:90%
go back and work at my old job.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.270 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I would--

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.010 align:middle line:84%
even if I won the
lottery, I wouldn't

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.820 align:middle line:84%
quit what I'm doing today
because it's so meaningful.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.970 align:middle line:84%
My mission, again, is to
end the suffering that I

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.740 align:middle line:90%
see so many people go through.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.470 align:middle line:84%
They're walking around
like zombies on this--

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.480 align:middle line:84%
addicted to this
processed food, addicted

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.910 align:middle line:84%
to these sugary
drinks, and addicted

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.718 align:middle line:84%
to a way of life that doesn't
serve their well-being

00:31:53.718 --> 00:31:55.010 align:middle line:90%
and doesn't serve their health.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
what's possible.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I can tell you I
didn't know what was possible

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:90%
before I got healthy.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want them to
feel as good as I do.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I do this
work every single day

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.720 align:middle line:84%
and why I'm going to continue
to do this until the day I die,

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.260 align:middle line:84%
because I know I
can reach people.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that
people are changing

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
as a result of this information
and improving their lives,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.600 align:middle line:90%

fulfillment in life,

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I think you need to realize
that this world in this life

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.640 align:middle line:90%
is just bigger than yourself.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.780 align:middle line:84%
That you are just one
piece of the puzzle,

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:84%
you are one mechanism
of this world.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And once you realize
that the work that you do

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.570 align:middle line:84%
serves a greater
purpose and the work

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:84%
that you do supports
more than yourself,

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:84%
you start to live a life
that if you died tomorrow,

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.390 align:middle line:90%
you would be perfectly content.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is really how
I want to live my life.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
If I died tomorrow,
I would feel really

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:45.227 align:middle line:84%
good about the impact
and the amount of effort

00:33:45.227 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that I gave back to the world
to make it a better place.

So a famous Buddhist
monk, Thich Nhat Hanh,

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.550 align:middle line:90%
says no mud, no lotus.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is a phrase
that has really guided me

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:84%
through being an activist,
and to really go up

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.310 align:middle line:84%
against huge food conglomerates
and chemical companies that

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.550 align:middle line:84%
want to do whatever they can
to prevent you from getting

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.840 align:middle line:90%
this information out.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And hearing that phrase,
no mud, no lotus,

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.032 align:middle line:84%
reminds me that
without the struggle,

00:34:24.032 --> 00:34:24.990 align:middle line:90%
we can't have progress.
