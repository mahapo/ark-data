00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What was it like, Jim,
growing up being Jim Kwik

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.140 align:middle line:90%
growing up in New York?

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I like
sharing my story.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm more excited
about teaching stuff.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so this is the challenge
right now is I can talk about--

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Teaching

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>> --motivation, and ideas, and
habits, and beliefs, and diet,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and breathing, and
routines, and everything.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.677 align:middle line:90%
But talk about myself, it just--

00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> You're a teacher.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And it probably came
because, you know, that injury.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's one
of those things,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:84%
where you know one
incident in your life

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:90%
could change everything.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.850 align:middle line:84%
It was like a big
inflection point.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember
one day, we were in--

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:90%
I was in kindergarten.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.787 align:middle line:84%
And there was this noise
outside the window.

00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:90%
And we're in kindergarten.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:90%
We're like this tall, right?

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can't see out
the window at all.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:84%
But the teacher says, wow,
there are fire trucks outside.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.388 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I
just lit up when

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I heard this thing
about fire trucks,

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
because I lived
by a fire station.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them do
amazing things.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt like they
were real life heroes,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:90%
like superheroes.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.613 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't see
outside the window.

00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And all the kids started
grabbing their chairs

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and putting it by the window to
be able to see the fire trucks.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And I grabbed my chair.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I was excited.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it over
to the windowsill.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And there's this big
iron grate radiator

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:90%
dividing the window and such.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:90%
And you had to be very careful.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just they're kind of
like tipping down a little bit.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I finally
got to see my heroes there.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:90%
My face lit up.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was such a good day.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And then about a split
second after that,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
one of the other children
grabbed my chair,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
so that they could see
outside the window.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And I went face first, head
first, right into the radiator.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember a
lot after that moment.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The way my parents
describe it I was bleeding.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was rushed
to the hospital.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:90%
And they said this.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
My mother said I
was never the same

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
after that in terms of
my personality and such.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And where it really showed
up in school was my learning.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I had these learning
difficulties.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Teachers would have to repeat
themselves over, and over,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
pretend I understood.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't really understand.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I had very challenged focus.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:84%
My concentration was
really compromised.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:90%
I had a very poor memory.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't retain information.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
thing where I felt

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
like I was the most
inadequate was reading.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.058 align:middle line:90%
You know, all the other kids--

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
remember when you would
get around in the circles

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and you would pass
around that book

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:90%
and you have to read out loud?

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that book getting
closer, and closer, and closer.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And every single time it got
passed on to another child,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:90%
I got a little bit more nervous.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And my heart starts racing.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was perspiring.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew when
that book came to me,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able to
read like the other kids.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.698 align:middle line:84%
And finally, when
the book came to me,

00:02:59.698 --> 00:03:00.740 align:middle line:90%
I would look at the book.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And I just saw letters.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't
mean anything to me.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't know what
was wrong with me at the time.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a challenge
when you're a child facing

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:90%
these kind of struggles.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.120 align:middle line:84%
Because you feel like
you're not enough.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And you feel like
something's the matter.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first
time this happened.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.458 align:middle line:90%
I would take the book.

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:90%
And I would look at my teacher.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:90%
And she would just look at me.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was this encouraging,
like you could do it.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.067 align:middle line:90%
But I really-- I couldn't do it.

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:90%
And I would take the book.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would just pass
it on to the next child

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and would have to hold back
my tears at that moment.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And it actually took me an
extra three to four years just

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to read.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And I actually taught myself
how to read by reading

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:90%
comic books late at night.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I remember my
uncle, my aunt, they

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:84%
gave me comic books for certain
occasions, like birthdays

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:90%
and Christmas and such.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And at night when my parents
thought I was sleeping,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.535 align:middle line:90%
I would take a flashlight.

00:03:57.535 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would be
underneath the covers.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be reading these and
not really understanding it.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
But something about the
illustrations of the comic book

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:84%
heroes, something
about good versus evil,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
something about making a
difference, that one person can

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
make a difference,
something about the hope

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and its theme of the
superhero journey

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:90%
brought the words to life.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And I started to understand
for the very first time.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite superheroes
growing up actually

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:90%
were the X-Men.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The X-Men, not because
they were the strongest.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.623 align:middle line:90%
It's because they didn't fit in.

00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:90%
They were the mutants.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:90%
They were the outcasts.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And I felt growing up with
these learning challenges

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't fit in.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I was
one of those people

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:90%
without the superpowers.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I found out,
one of the big highlights when

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I was reading this
comic book was

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that the superhero school, the
X-Men School for the Gifted

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
run by Professor
X, Charles Xavier,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
actually resided right there
in Westchester, New York.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I lived.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember
every weekend when

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I was about eight
or nine years old,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
I would ride my bicycle
around my neighborhood.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
find that school.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:90%
Because I wanted to run away.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to run away to find my
school, to find my superpowers,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
to find my super friends.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And really, I remember
a defining moment

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:90%
when I was nine years old.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.642 align:middle line:84%
I remember that a teacher
was talking to another adult

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:24.100 align:middle line:84%
thinking I wasn't
paying attention,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
or maybe thinking that I wasn't
smart enough to understand

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:90%
what she was saying.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And she pointed
right at me and said

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that is the boy with
the broken brain.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the boy with
the broken brain.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.408 align:middle line:84%
And I remember how
hard that hit me.

00:05:36.408 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, children
understand more than you

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.538 align:middle line:90%
think that they understand.

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think adults have
to be very careful,

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.455 align:middle line:90%
especially around children.

00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Because their external voice
becomes their internal voice.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember always
referring back to that moment

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%
all through all through school.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I didn't do
well, I was like, oh, it's

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:90%
because I'm broken.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:90%
It's because I'm different.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It's because my
mind doesn't work

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.380 align:middle line:90%
like everybody else's does.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
growing up also, I

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:84%
had this sense of
responsibility.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm the oldest
of three children.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to be a good
role model for my younger

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.162 align:middle line:90%
brother and my younger sister.

00:06:09.162 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:90%
So I had that pressure.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And I really just wanted
to make my family proud.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.018 align:middle line:84%
The challenge was I just
wouldn't-- it's funny.

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Because you grow up
and you feel like

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that you have this
potential inside of you.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.023 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder like,
it's so unfair that you

00:06:23.023 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:90%
have to work so much harder.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
When's it going to
actually show up?

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But you feel that
specialness inside.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And I had so much
love with my family.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
They're not the wealthiest
or the healthiest or the most

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.420 align:middle line:90%
spiritual.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But they're just very
kind, good people.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to
make them proud.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I had
one opportunity back

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:84%
in high school, because
I was failing out

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:84%
of English, which was one
of my hardest subjects,

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
read and everything

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
having to do with words was
a very big challenge for me.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And my teacher during a student
parent teacher conference,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
they pulled my parents
aside, because I

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:90%
was this kind of special case.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher offered
us an opportunity

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to redeem my
grades and said, OK, Jim, I

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:84%
know you have this
potential inside of you.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:90%
And I know.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.407 align:middle line:90%
We see how hard that you work.

00:07:13.407 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to give
you a special assignment.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do some
research and write

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
a report on this genius, this
genius named Leonardo da Vinci.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had never heard of
Leonardo da Vinci before.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And she said that if I
could do this book report,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
then she'll count
that as extra credit.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:90%
And I could pass this class.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.587 align:middle line:84%
And I remember seeing
my mother and my father.

00:07:35.587 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And they had hopes saying,
Jim, you could do this.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
you really could do.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I really dived in
like I never had before.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I always worked hard,
because I had that discipline

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:45.970 align:middle line:90%
from my parents.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.878 align:middle line:90%
But I put everything into this.

00:07:47.878 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would spend
all this time right

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.818 align:middle line:84%
after school going to
the public library.

00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be the first one there.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:90%
I'd be the last one to leave.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And I did all this research
on this incredible Renaissance

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:90%
He was an artist.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:90%
And he was an architect.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:90%
And he was a scientist.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:90%
And he could juggle.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.717 align:middle line:84%
He could do all
these amazing things.

00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wow.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I wish I could
be like this person one day.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And so finally, I
finished the report.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And my parents helped me
to have it professionally

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:90%
really nicely bound.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.493 align:middle line:90%
And I was so proud of this.

00:08:22.493 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going
to school that day.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.315 align:middle line:90%
I put it into my backpack.

00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had it with me
all through the day.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
wait for that class

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.429 align:middle line:84%
to be able to turn
it into the teacher.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to the class,
at the end of the class, when

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
we had only a handful of minutes
left, and the teacher said,

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, class, we have a
special surprise right now.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Jim, I'd like you to come
in front of the class

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and talk about your book report,
talk about Leonardo da Vinci.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.938 align:middle line:84%
And one of the side
effects of being labeled

00:08:54.938 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
the boy with the broken
brain is you don't really

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:90%
connect to people.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:90%
I was already introverted.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:90%
But I was also painfully shy.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I didn't connect
with a lot of people.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I was bullied back in school.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.905 align:middle line:84%
And when the teacher said I
had to go in front of the class

00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and present on
it, I mean, I felt

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:90%
like my heart just stopped.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:90%
And I was perspiring.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't only stop.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like it was
going a million miles an hour

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.240 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was so petrified.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:90%
And I go to the teacher.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
walking up to her.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I just whispered
into here ears.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I didn't do it.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do the book report.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And she was just shocked.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:90%
I remember looking at her face.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And it just ended like that.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And when the class
left, I remember

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I was the last one there,
because I had to get--

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:90%
you know, compose myself.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And then when I left,
I took my book report.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And I actually put it into
the trash and along with it

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a lot of my
hopes, and my dreams,

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and my potential was going
into the garbage also as well.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So that was a real
defining moment in my life.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it's, you
know, you always

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
hope like when you watch movies
that the main character is

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:90%
going to step up.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.867 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to surprise
everybody and reach down.

00:10:08.867 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And then their life is
never going to be the same.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
But I felt like that was
another example, where there

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:90%
was something that was wrong.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So after such
traumatic incidences,

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:23.070 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult to
look back on it.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, so
many children will

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:84%
be able to relate with
this story especially.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.992 align:middle line:84%
Because the shyness, not
being able to speak up.

00:10:29.992 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:84%
You're really in a discovering
phase of finding your voice.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you're labeled
as broken, you

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.840 align:middle line:84%
internalize that
as a belief system.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:90%
But you met a gentleman--

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I forget who you referenced--

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
who challenged you
with a few questions.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And that really helped you
transition out of we'll

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:84%
hang on a victim
mentality to more of like,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.077 align:middle line:84%
I can be in control of
my destiny somewhat here.

00:10:50.077 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Who was this person?

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And what did he say to you?

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.945 align:middle line:84%
>> So all of high
school was this.

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:90%
It was my struggles.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I would work so much
harder than everybody else.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought
it was unfair,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
because my grades
didn't reflect that.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
But I was lucky enough
to get into a university.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:90%
And I remember freshman year.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, this is it.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
This is my chance right
now to prove to the world,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:84%
to prove to myself, to
make my family proud,

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:90%
that I could be worth something.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And I took all these classes.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
And basically, I wanted to--

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was--

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.560 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I'm a freshman.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
make a fresh start.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I took all these
classes ready to achieve.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:90%
And I actually did worse.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And things got even
more difficult for me.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And I was ready to quit school.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't have the money
as it was to go to college.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to
waste that and waste time.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And so when I told
that to my friend,

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.340 align:middle line:84%
my friend was like, Jim,
before you quit school and tell

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:84%
your parents that
you're leaving,

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
why don't you come
with me this weekend?

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to visit my
family this weekend,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
just get some time away,
get some perspective.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
perspective really

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:90%
makes a difference, right?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.955 align:middle line:84%
You change your place or you
change the people you're with,

00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:84%
it gives you a
different point of view.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:90%
So I agree to go there.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
right before dinner,

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:84%
his father was walking
me around his property.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And they're pretty well to do.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.845 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me this
very innocent question,

00:12:12.845 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
which is the worst question that
you could ask me at this time.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:90%
He says, Jim, how is school?

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And it just hits me.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Because this is what
my whole life is about.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I start crying and
bawling right in front

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:90%
this complete stranger.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And I tell him my whole story,
how I had a brain injury.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't learn
like everybody else.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the boy with
the broken brain.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:90%
And school is just not for me.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.405 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, Jim,
stop for a minute.

00:12:41.405 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And he looks me
right in the eyes

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and asked me this question.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
He says, Jim, why
are you in school?

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.762 align:middle line:90%
Why are you in school?

00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to be?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to do?

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.552 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to have?

00:12:50.552 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:90%
What do you want to share?

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, I never
thought about that before.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, ask a new question
and you get a new answer, right?

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:90%
And my focus went there.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have a
quick answer for him.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.023 align:middle line:84%
And when I was thinking
about it for a little bit,

00:13:04.023 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:90%
I start to answer him.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:90%
An he says, stop.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And he pulls out from his back
pocket a diary, like a journal.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:90%
And he tears out a few sheets.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:90%
And he hands them to me.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And he makes me write down
my answers, my answers of who

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to be, what I want
to do, what I want to have,

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
what I want to share
with the world.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
much time went by.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But when I was done, I start
folding up the sheets of paper

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:90%
to put in my pocket.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And he grabs them
right out of my hand.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'm freaking out.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I wasn't expecting
anyone to see my dreams,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:90%
and my fantasies, my goals.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And he starts reading
them to himself.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:90%
I get so nervous.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And I can literally--

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.257 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting-- I get goose
bumps even thinking about it.

00:13:47.257 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know what
he's thinking right now.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:90%
And when he's done--

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.543 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much time
went by-- but he looks at me.

00:13:52.543 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
He says, Jim, you are this
close to every single thing

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:90%
on that list.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just thinking-- he
spreads his fingers about

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:90%
a foot apart--

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.047 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking,
there is no way.

00:14:01.047 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Give me 10 lifetimes, I'm
not going to crack that list.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And he takes his
fingers and he puts them

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to the side of my head,
my temple, right here.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that between
my ears is the key.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's my mind.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:90%
It's my brain.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And he walks me to
a room of his home

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.020 align:middle line:90%
that I've never seen before.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:90%
He walks me into a room.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's wall to wall, ceiling
to floor covered in books.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you imagine like
a library in somebody's home?

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in this
library right now.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And remember, my
associations with books.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very poor reader, right?

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And I'm scared.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.708 align:middle line:90%
I'm phobic of books.

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But it would be the
equivalent of someone walking

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:90%
into a room full of snakes.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.350 align:middle line:84%
But what makes it
worse is he starts

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
grabbing snakes from the shelf
and starts handing them to me.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm freaking out, because
this is not very comfortable.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking at
the title of these books.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're these biographies
of incredible men and women

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:84%
throughout history and some very
early personal growth books,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Norman Vincent Peale, "The
Power of Positive Thinking,"

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.260 align:middle line:84%
"The Magic of Thinking
Big," "Psycho-Cybernetics,"

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:84%
"Think and Grow Rich," you know,
all these books on mind set,

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.110 align:middle line:90%
the power of the mind.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Jim, I want you to
read one of these books a week.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.518 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, have you
not heard anything I've said?

00:15:15.518 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I have all of these learning
difficulties and all

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.670 align:middle line:90%
these learning problems.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:90%
I have so much schoolwork to do.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:90%
We have midterms.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:90%
And he says, stop.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:84%
He's like, Jim,
don't let school get

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.070 align:middle line:90%
in the way of your education.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:90%
And it just floors me.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize at the time
it was a Mark Twain quote.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But I said, you know,
that's really good insight.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I still, I can't commit
to reading these books,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.190 align:middle line:84%
because I have all
this schoolwork.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's a great saying.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.840 align:middle line:90%
But I really can't do it.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to promise
this and break my promise.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And a very smart
man, what he does

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:90%
is he reaches into his pocket.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And he pulls out my goals,
my dreams, my bucket list,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And this time, he starts reading
every single one of my goals

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
out loud, all my
dreams out loud.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And something about
hearing your dreams

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.200 align:middle line:84%
coming from a stranger's voice,
incanted out into the universe,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.280 align:middle line:90%
it shook my heart.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It shook my spirit and
my soul something fierce.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
things on my list

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.192 align:middle line:84%
were things I wanted
to do for my parents

00:16:13.192 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and for my family, things
that they can never afford.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Or even if they could, they
would never do for themselves.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And with that extra motivation--

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I think motivation
really is key in terms

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
of why we do what we
do, especially when it

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.300 align:middle line:90%
comes to learning.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So I commit to reading one
book a week with that leverage

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.750 align:middle line:90%
and motivation.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.005 align:middle line:84%
And fast forward,
now I'm at school.

00:16:31.005 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And I have a pile
of books that I

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.540 align:middle line:84%
have to read for school
and a pile of books

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
that I want to read that I
promised to read for my life.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And I can't even keep up
with one of those piles.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And so what do I do?

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:90%
I sacrifice.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.290 align:middle line:90%
I don't sleep.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't exercise.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't spend time with friends.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't do the things that
would nourish my soul.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I just
live in the library.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's not very
sustainable, right?

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I end up actually
passing out one night.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And I fall down a
flight of stairs.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:90%
And I hit my head again.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:90%
And I wake up two days later.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.980 align:middle line:90%
And now, I'm in the hospital.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.867 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
because I wasn't eating,

00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:90%
I was really wasting away.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.500 align:middle line:90%
I was down to 117 pounds.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was a very dark time.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.740 align:middle line:90%
I thought I died.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Maybe part of me--

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was very-- it
was very hard, difficult.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up, another
part of me woke up thinking,

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.678 align:middle line:90%
there has to be a better way.

00:17:20.678 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm lying there in
the hospital bed thinking,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.800 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do?

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.383 align:middle line:84%
And when I had that
thought, the nurse

00:17:25.383 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:90%
came in with a mug of tea.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And on it had a drawing
of an incredible genius

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:90%
named Albert Einstein.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And it had a quote
there that we've all

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.045 align:middle line:84%
heard before, that we've
all seen in some iteration.

00:17:37.045 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
It said, the same
level of thinking

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.692 align:middle line:84%
that's created the problem
won't solve the problem.

00:17:41.692 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
The same level of thinking
that's created the problem

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.010 align:middle line:90%
won't solve the problem.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And it made me ask
a new question.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.895 align:middle line:84%
It made me ask this question
like, what's my problem?

00:17:49.895 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I came up this
answer saying, well,

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm a real slow learner.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.055 align:middle line:90%
I learn very slowly.

00:17:54.055 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:90%
I have a very slow brain.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do I think
differently about it?

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe I can learn
how to learn faster,

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.328 align:middle line:90%
learn how to learn.

00:18:01.328 --> 00:18:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So I think, how am I going
to learn how to learn?

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe school.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
So I pick up a course bulletin,
looking at all the classes

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:90%
for next semester.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I look at all these
hundreds of classes.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And all of them are
classes on what's learned,

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:84%
math, and history, and
science, and Spanish.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:84%
But there were
zero classes on how

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to learn, how to think for
yourself, how to be creative,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:84%
how to solve problems,
how to actively listen,

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
how to concentrate and
focus, how to read faster,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.983 align:middle line:90%
how to remember things.

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I always thought
back in school it

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.733 align:middle line:84%
should have been the fourth
R. They teach you three R's,

00:18:32.733 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:90%
reading, writing, arithmetic.

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:90%
But what about remembering?

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:90%
What about retention?

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:90%
What about recall?

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Socrates says, learning
is remembering.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:84%
There is no learning
without remembering.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:90%
So I put my studies aside.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:90%
And I make studying my studies.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to really solve this
riddle about how does my brain

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:90%
work, so I could work my brain?

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.190 align:middle line:84%
How does my memory work,
so I can work my memory?

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And I just started studying
positive psychology,

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and adult learning theory,
of multiple intelligences,

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
anything I could get my hands
on on how to unlock this gift.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And an amazing thing happened.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.190 align:middle line:84%
About two months
in this process,

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.720 align:middle line:90%
a light switch flipped on.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And I started to understand
things in a different way.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I started to have better
focus, better concentration.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I started to read faster.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I started to be able
to think more clearly.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I had this new life
inside of my mind.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:90%
And my grades improved.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, but my life
started to elevate and improve.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
why I do what I do

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:84%
is because I couldn't help
but help other people.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was
tutoring this young woman.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:90%
She was a freshman.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And she read 30 books
in 30 days, 30 books.

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, could you imagine?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what could you do?

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
What books would you read if
you read 30 books in 30 days?

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And then not only read it,
but actually comprehend it,

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:90%
retain all that information?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to find
out not how she did it.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know why she did
it, going back to motivation.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And I found out by asking her.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
I found out that her mother
was dying of terminal cancer

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and was given only 60 days
to live, just two months.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And the books she was
reading were books on health,

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
books on wellness,
books on energy.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Because she was determined
to save her mother's life.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was just--

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, I get goosebumps
thinking about it.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:90%
I call them truth bumps.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And I just wished
her luck and said I

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:90%
would say prayers and thoughts.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Six months later, I get a
call from this young lady.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:90%
And she's crying.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:90%
She's crying, crying.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:90%
She can't stop.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I find out
they're tears of joy,

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:84%
that her mother not only
survived, but is really

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.760 align:middle line:90%
getting better.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.817 align:middle line:90%
Doctors don't know how.

00:20:29.817 --> 00:20:30.650 align:middle line:90%
They don't know why.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:90%
The doctors called it a miracle.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But her mother attributed
it 100% to the great advice

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:84%
she got from her
daughter who learned it

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:90%
from all these books.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
I realized something.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I realized that if
knowledge is power,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
learning is your super power,
that if knowledge is power,

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:90%
learning is your super power.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a super power we all
have available inside of us.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So from that moment,
I dedicated my life

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
to help people to unlock
those super powers,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:84%
their mental super powers,
the modern day super powers.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I talk about
superheroes going back

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to the comic books and
my reading disability.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.405 align:middle line:84%
But really, modern
day super heroes--

00:21:06.405 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
super powers that

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.853 align:middle line:84%
allow you to jump,
leap tall buildings

00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and shoot lasers
out of your eyes.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, modern day super
powers, like your ability

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to think clearly, your ability
to have a proper mindset,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.210 align:middle line:84%
your ability to
engineer your habits,

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
your ability to manage
your own attitude,

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.412 align:middle line:84%
your ability to learn faster,
to focus, to concentrate.

00:21:26.412 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that
I really get excited about.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.162 align:middle line:84%
That when people step into that
better version of themselves,

00:21:31.162 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
the version that they know
could be inside of them,

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that version I knew was deep
inside of me all those years,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.530 align:middle line:84%
but I just couldn't unlock
it, I wanted to decode that.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
On the theme of superheroes,
I remember one day,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.905 align:middle line:84%
our office gets a call
from 20th Century Fox.

00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted me to do
this very special training

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:84%
for the chairman of Fox
and the executive team.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.925 align:middle line:90%
And I remember going there.

00:21:50.925 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:90%
And I was so excited.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.322 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was going through
the hallway to the boardroom,

00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:84%
all these movie
posters were there,

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.545 align:middle line:84%
like "Star Wars" and "Avatar"
and all the classics.

00:22:00.545 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And it made me feel like
I was a child again,

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:90%
that nine-year-old boy.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.208 align:middle line:84%
And I gave one of my
very best trainings

00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:90%
for their executive team.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.125 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was
done, the chairman of Fox

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:90%
said, Jim, thank you so much.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And he gave me this wonderful
tour of the Fox lot.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
going on this tour.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And out of the corner my eyes
I see this Wolverine poster.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And I am such a big Hugh
Jackman Wolverine fan.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.073 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I can't wait
for that movie to come out.

00:22:25.073 --> 00:22:26.615 align:middle line:84%
And the chairman
picked up his phone.

00:22:26.615 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And then five minutes later,
I'm in the Fox Theater

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:84%
watching Wolverine fight all
these super ninjas, right?

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.405 align:middle line:84%
It was the best
Friday afternoon ever.

00:22:33.405 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And when he comes to
get me afterwards,

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.370 align:middle line:90%
he says, how is the movie?

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm still
in that childlike mode,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I just say, oh, you
don't know this.

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:41.246 align:middle line:90%
I tell him my whole story.

00:22:41.246 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:90%
I was like, you don't know this.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.607 align:middle line:84%
But when I was a child,
I had a brain injury.

00:22:44.607 --> 00:22:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I had all these
learning difficulties.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I was labeled a boy
with a broken brain.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And I taught myself how to read
by reading comic books late

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.173 align:middle line:84%
And my favorite comic
books growing up

00:22:53.173 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
were "Wolverine"
and "The X-Men."

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And I tell them
the highlight of it

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.300 align:middle line:84%
was seeing that the X-Men
school was in Westchester.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.655 align:middle line:84%
I still look for my school
every single weekend.

00:23:02.655 --> 00:23:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, Jim, I didn't
know you like superheroes.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to go
with me to Comic Con?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like, what?

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And you know Comic Con
is like the largest

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.730 align:middle line:90%
gathering of superheroes ever.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, when is it?

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
He's like, it's today,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.978 align:middle line:84%
And my mind goes from a
nine-year-old to a 99-year-old.

00:23:20.978 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
I started thinking,
oh, there's going

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
to be traffic going
from LA to San Diego.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.040 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing to wear.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to wait
in all these lines.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.420 align:middle line:90%
I have all these meetings here.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, I talk
my way out of it.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:32.015 align:middle line:84%
And he stops me and says,
Jim, do you want to go?

00:23:32.015 --> 00:23:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm going tomorrow.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, I
totally want to go with you.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So the next morning,
he picks me up.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And instead of driving to San
Diego, we get onto his plane.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we get on to his
plane, waiting on the plane

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:90%
is the entire cast of X-Men.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just flip out, I mean,
Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even see Hugh
Jackman and Patrick Stewart.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.480 align:middle line:90%
I see Wolverine and Professor X.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting in between
Jennifer Lawrence and Halle

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Berry going to Comic Con.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's such
an amazing day.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.400 align:middle line:84%
When we come back to
LA after that day,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:84%
the chairman asked
me how my day went.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
this was incredible.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Jim, I have
something else for you.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I don't
want anything else.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:90%
What can I do for you?

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
He's like, the cast
really loved you.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:90%
How would you like to go on set?

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what do you mean?

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.897 align:middle line:84%
He's like, we have
another 30 days

00:24:14.897 --> 00:24:16.798 align:middle line:84%
of filming the new
X-Men movie in Montreal.

00:24:16.798 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:90%
How would you like to go?

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have never been
on a film set before.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.223 align:middle line:84%
And I'm acting like
I'm nine-years-old

00:24:21.223 --> 00:24:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, yeah,
yes, I want to go.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Please take me.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:26.905 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what
can I do for you?

00:24:26.905 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And he says, Jim, do the
same thing you did for us,

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.502 align:middle line:84%
share with them
your superpowers.

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Teach them how to
speed read scripts, how

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:84%
to memorize their lines,
how to be focused on set.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I could
absolutely do that.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So the next morning, we're
on what they call the X jet.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I get on this plane
with the cast of the X-Men.

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm sharing them my brain
tips for learning faster

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.180 align:middle line:90%
and achieving more.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.132 align:middle line:84%
And when we get on set,
it's incredible coincidence

00:24:50.132 --> 00:24:51.590 align:middle line:84%
that the scene that
they're filming

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.250 align:middle line:84%
takes place in the X-Men
School for the Gifted.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there as a
nine-year-old boy

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:00.020 align:middle line:84%
seeing my superheroes come
to life right in front of me.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
even the best part.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.520 align:middle line:84%
When I go home, there's
a package waiting for me.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's the size
of a television set.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:90%
And I open it up.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's this photograph
of me and the entire cast

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.090 align:middle line:90%
of the X-Men.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But even better than that is
the note from the chairman.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:90%
It says this.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Jim, thank you so much for
sharing your superpowers

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:90%
with all of us.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been looking
for superheroes school

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.770 align:middle line:90%
since you were a child.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Here's your class photo.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I felt like
I went full circle.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've been looking
for my school my entire life.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when I
found my gift of unlocking

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
these super brains,
you know, that I

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:84%
was able to teach and share
and learn from my superheroes.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.438 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:25:48.438 --> 00:25:49.480 align:middle line:90%
What an incredible story.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you think about
helping someone transition from

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:84%
being someone that thinks they
cannot learn to being someone

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.690 align:middle line:84%
who has the capability to
learn, do you often find that

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:84%
it's limiting beliefs
that are the main,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:84%
first step that
hold people back?

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And how can people
identify if they

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.243 align:middle line:90%
do have any limiting beliefs?

00:26:08.243 --> 00:26:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> When I'm onstage, I do
this interactive exercise,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
where I have everybody stand up
and point with the right hand

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and turn clockwise to see
how far they could go.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I have them
visualize themselves doing it,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:84%
but this time going two
times, and three times,

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and four times around.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when they're done with
this visualization exercise,

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:84%
I have them stand up
again and point forward

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:84%
with their right hand and turn
how far they can now turn.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And across the board, it's
about 25%-50% further.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So the question I
ask them is this.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Were you physically
capable of turning that

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.140 align:middle line:90%
far the first time?

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.007 align:middle line:84%
And all of them
say, yes, of course.

00:26:39.007 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Like, nobody took a yoga class
when everyone's eyes were

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:90%
closed or anything like that.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, where's the limitation?

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And people say, they come to
the conclusion, it's my mind,

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.845 align:middle line:84%
where limitations
are in my beliefs.

00:26:49.845 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And I ask, well, how
many beliefs do we have?

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, there are
countless, countless beliefs.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.560 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:90%
All behavior is belief driven.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:90%
All behavior is belief driven.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
If you want to create a new
result in your life going back

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.358 align:middle line:84%
to be, do, have, share, if you
want to be able to share more

00:27:05.358 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and you want to be
able to have more,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.192 align:middle line:90%
you need to be able to do more.

00:27:08.192 --> 00:27:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But in order for you
to be able to do more,

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.852 align:middle line:84%
you have to believe
that you can, right?

00:27:11.852 --> 00:27:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Because if you believe
you can or believe

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.720 align:middle line:84%
you can't, either
way, you're right.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Henry Ford said that.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Wayne Dyer says, it's not you'll
believe it when you see it.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's you'll see it
when you believe it.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And success really is
an inside out process

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of taking the invisible
and making it visible.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Even athletes do this, right?

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.410 align:middle line:84%
They use visualization to be
able to reach their goals,

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to change
their belief system.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Roger Bannister,
what did Roger Bannister

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.480 align:middle line:90%
do in 1954?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:90%
He broke the four minute mile.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.772 align:middle line:84%
Throughout human history,
no one could run a mile

00:27:40.772 --> 00:27:41.880 align:middle line:90%
less than four minutes.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the belief back
then was the human heart

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:84%
wasn't able to sustain
a sub four minute mile.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:90%
It would explode in your chest.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And you would die.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:90%
And now, I'm a runner, right?

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, with a name like
Kwik, I had to be a runner.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And that wouldn't keep me from
running a four minute mile.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:84%
That would keep me
from running period.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.932 align:middle line:90%
I would never want to do that.

00:27:59.932 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
was he would actually

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.140 align:middle line:84%
visualize himself
crossing the finish line.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And in his mind, he
would see the clock.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:90%
And it says 3:59.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Because he knows that it has
to happen in here before it

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.463 align:middle line:90%
happens out there.

00:28:11.463 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was an
interesting part.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But the other part that
I found interesting

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:90%
was what happened after that.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could run a
sub four minute mile.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
one person does it.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:84%
What happens over
the next few years?

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:84%
Dozens and dozens
of people start

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:90%
running a sub four minute mile.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, was there a big advancement
in shoe technology, training

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:84%
methodology, nutritional
supplementation?

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Where was the change?

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:90%
A change in belief.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Because all of a sudden,
one person could do it,

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
then it gave permission
for everybody else.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It shook up that
limiting belief.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's so important.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we have
negative thoughts,

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:84%
people come to me all the
time and say, you know, Jim,

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm just getting too old.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.970 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm very forgetful.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is
biological, right?

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not smart enough.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.267 align:middle line:90%
I always tell people this.

00:28:51.267 --> 00:28:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It's that if you fight
for your limitations,

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:90%
you get to keep them.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.700 align:middle line:84%
If you argue for your
limits, you get to keep them.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And that self talk
makes a difference.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was
preparing for a marathon.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.540 align:middle line:90%
And I like to read.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm an avid reader.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading this
book on the psychology

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.880 align:middle line:90%
of running a marathon.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.103 align:middle line:84%
And this one chapter
said this verbatim,

00:29:08.103 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:90%
because I'm a memory expert.

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:90%
It said this.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.210 align:middle line:84%
"Your brain is like
a supercomputer.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And your self talk is
a program it will run.

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.492 align:middle line:84%
So if you tell yourself you're
not good at remembering names,

00:29:17.492 --> 00:29:19.950 align:middle line:84%
you will not remember the name
of the next person you meet.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you program your
supercomputer not to."

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to your
self talk and your belief,

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.070 align:middle line:84%
you always need to be able
to stand guard to your mind.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the thing.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is always
eavesdropping

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.140 align:middle line:90%
on your self talk.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is always
eavesdropping

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.710 align:middle line:90%
on your self talk.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a program that
the supercomputer will run.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So when people want
to make a change

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.480 align:middle line:84%
or they want to create a
transformation in their life,

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.480 align:middle line:84%
most people look at this level
of behavior, the behavior.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.840 align:middle line:84%
They want to be able
to stop smoking.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Or they want to be
able to meditate.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Or they want to be
able to journal,

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
make it a habit, and
not self sabotage,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.640 align:middle line:84%
or not put it off,
or not procrastinate.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Usually though,
they try to force it

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:90%
on the behavioral level.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.320 align:middle line:90%
But there are other levels also.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
These are the levels of
transformation, if you will.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Right above that
level, above behavior

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.570 align:middle line:90%
are capabilities, capabilities.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to be
able to do this behavior,

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.850 align:middle line:84%
you need the capabilities,
or the skills, the habits,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
the training, to be able
to do that behavior.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Somebody could say they
want a behavior of speed

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.390 align:middle line:84%
reading every single day,
or remembering names.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.235 align:middle line:84%
But the capabilities
are the actual training

00:30:23.235 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:84%
that give you that ability to
be able to do that behavior.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, above this
level of capabilities

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:84%
is this level of beliefs and
values, beliefs, and values.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:84%
That basically says
that if you want

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.400 align:middle line:84%
to do this behavior
of let's say,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.593 align:middle line:84%
remembering people's names,
because a lot of people

00:30:38.593 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:84%
have trouble remembering
names, yes, maybe you

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:90%
have the capabilities.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have the
belief that you could do it,

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.872 align:middle line:84%
maybe you have a belief
like you're too old,

00:30:45.872 --> 00:30:47.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe you have a
belief like oh I'm

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:84%
not smart enough, or a
belief that I'm just not

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.760 align:middle line:84%
good at remembering
names, that would keep you

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.090 align:middle line:90%
from doing the behavior.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:56.105 align:middle line:84%
The other part of it is
besides belief, are values.

00:30:56.105 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:90%
These are the values.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.360 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
you hold the most important.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't think that it's
important to remember people's

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
names, the value will keep you
from doing the actual behavior.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, above beliefs and
values is another level.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the level of
identity, identity.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And the level of identity
is the level of I am.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
They say these are
the most powerful

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.937 align:middle line:90%
two words in the language.

00:31:16.937 --> 00:31:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Because anything
that comes after that

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.925 align:middle line:90%
becomes your destiny.

00:31:19.925 --> 00:31:20.800 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Someone can create
a behavior and say,

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I have this new behavior
of stop smoking.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to stop smoking.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But if their identity
is that of a smoker,

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.050 align:middle line:90%
they won't make that change.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Somebody here could
say, oh, I want

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to be able to remember
things better.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the behavior.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But their identity is
I'm a forgetful person.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.080 align:middle line:84%
That will keep them from
making that transformation.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, below
this level of behavior

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is this level of
environment, environment.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.328 align:middle line:84%
This is really like where
you're spending your time.

00:31:48.328 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And so somebody can
have the behavior

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.722 align:middle line:84%
is let's say, reading
every single day.

00:31:52.722 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:84%
But if they're in an
environment with no books,

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.780 align:middle line:84%
that's not going to
allow them to do that.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.113 align:middle line:84%
If they're in an environment,
maybe there's no lighting.

00:31:58.113 --> 00:31:59.500 align:middle line:90%
They won't be able to do that.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe that they're
reading at a specific time

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's too late
and they're tired.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:05.840 align:middle line:84%
That's going to keep them
from executing the behavior.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So these are two levels
of transformation.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.035 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm looking to make
a change with somebody,

00:32:10.035 --> 00:32:11.770 align:middle line:84%
a change in behavior,
if they're getting

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:84%
stuck they're, always
look at the other areas.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the magic part.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Really when it comes down to
it, questions are the answer.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about school,
there were five questions,

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.348 align:middle line:84%
six questions if you
will, five W's and one H.

00:32:25.348 --> 00:32:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking at these
levels of transformation,

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
identity answers
the question of who.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:90%
This is the who.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The beliefs and values
answers the question, why?

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.790 align:middle line:84%
The level of capabilities
answers the question, how?

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:43.210 align:middle line:84%
The level of behavior is
the question of, what?

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And finally, this
level of environment

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:84%
answers the question,
where and when?

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear people get
stuck on a specific area,

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening for how
they're describing it.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:84%
So they say something
like, I can never do that.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And they emphasize I. I
know it's an identity issue.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.570 align:middle line:90%
You know, I can never do that.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Do is a level of capabilities.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>> This is fascinating.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.490 align:middle line:84%
This is really,
you've chunked down

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.380 align:middle line:84%
the process of helping
people understand

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.693 align:middle line:90%
where their blocks are.

00:33:09.693 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because I think
these distinctions are very

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
can't change something

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:17.200 align:middle line:84%
unless they articulate it and
they have a self-awareness.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.468 align:middle line:84%
I think self-awareness
is a superpower.

00:33:19.468 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think really
when it comes down

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:25.420 align:middle line:84%
to it, what does it take to be
truly fulfilled, truly happy?

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it comes
down to two things.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the curiosity
to want to know yourself,

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.130 align:middle line:84%
to really have that
self-awareness,

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to do the deep study
in terms of who you are

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.490 align:middle line:84%
in these levels, your
identities, your beliefs,

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:90%
your values, and so on.

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But just having the curiosity
to know yourself is not enough.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Once you have that, you
have to have the courage

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:45.627 align:middle line:90%
to be yourself.

00:33:45.627 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:84%
You need the courage to
be able to be that person.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So many people will go
through the efforts.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And they'll read lots of books.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:50.740 align:middle line:90%
And they'll meditate.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.573 align:middle line:90%
And they'll journal.

00:33:51.573 --> 00:33:52.720 align:middle line:90%
And they'll know themself.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.762 align:middle line:84%
But it's a different level
to be able to actually

00:33:54.762 --> 00:33:58.570 align:middle line:84%
be that person, when especially
we live in this world, where

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:01.710 align:middle line:84%
we have expectations from
others, our peer groups.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're not
walking our path.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
We're walking that
of our parents,

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.290 align:middle line:84%
or that of our friends, or with
the Joneses, or our neighbor.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And we put all this energy
into these different bodies.

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:12.909 align:middle line:84%
And it's like this
energy that people

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:16.060 align:middle line:84%
feel so fatigued nowadays
in today's modern society.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:90%
They're so depleted.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is they
put this energy out,

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:84%
this self-image
of like, oh, this

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.181 align:middle line:84%
is who they want to
project to the world.

00:34:23.181 --> 00:34:24.639 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
another image here

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:27.550 align:middle line:90%
that they fear who they are.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the image that they're
scared they really are.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And then this other image
is really who they are.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.710 align:middle line:84%
But their energy is dissipated
in these three areas.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder why people
are so tired all the time

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.590 align:middle line:84%
or they lose their passion,
or they lose that drive.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you find often when
you're working with people that

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.030 align:middle line:84%
people's lives and ambitions and
goals are driven out of fear,

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:54.950 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to out of love or
something they're passionate

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:55.750 align:middle line:90%
about?

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.125 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people that I've

00:34:57.125 --> 00:34:59.165 align:middle line:84%
spoken to have gone
through transformation

00:34:59.165 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:84%
have spent a big part of their
life chasing a goal or an idea

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't theirs.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And then somehow, they stumbled
across their superpower.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And they feel aligned, on
purpose, fulfilled, happy,

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:17.470 align:middle line:90%
driven beyond imagination.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Everything's there.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.190 align:middle line:90%
They lined up.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But it might have taken them
30 years to discover that.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:90%


00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:84%
How is it that people set
goals and ideas around

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:32.220 align:middle line:84%
from a place of fear as opposed
to a place of love and passion?

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I was
going on my journey,

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.150 align:middle line:84%
my inspiration really
was my desperation.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:38.915 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of it was this
idea that I could be better.

00:35:38.915 --> 00:35:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And I could make
my family proud.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.005 align:middle line:84%
But another part of my drive was
this fear that I wasn't enough.

00:35:44.005 --> 00:35:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel like
you're not enough,

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.463 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to be
loved, and you're not

00:35:47.463 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:90%
going to be protected.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And that was a fear
based approach.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And we get motivated by
both of these things.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I talk
about my desperation,

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.710 align:middle line:84%
it came through difficulty,
difficult times.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that when
we have difficult times,

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that that difficulty
could either define us.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.470 align:middle line:90%
It could diminishes.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Or it could develop us.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.160 align:middle line:84%
We hear a lot about
post-traumatic stress.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.770 align:middle line:90%
And I've had my share.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has their
own set of challenges

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:90%
in their own life.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:16.590 align:middle line:84%
But we don't hear a lot about
this other area of study

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:20.340 align:middle line:84%
called post-traumatic growth,
post-traumatic growth.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.350 align:middle line:84%
This is where you come
through difficulty.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.880 align:middle line:90%
You come through adversity.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side, you would
never wish those situations

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.230 align:middle line:90%
for anybody.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But you also wouldn't
change it for yourself.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:84%
That because you went through
those challenging times,

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.070 align:middle line:84%
it changed you, that you
found a deeper meaning.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:90%
You found a new strength.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.260 align:middle line:90%
You found your mission.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.420 align:middle line:84%
You found your purpose going
through those difficult times.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a lot
of people in life

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.080 align:middle line:84%
that have a strength that had
easy lives, really easy lives.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.970 align:middle line:84%
Because through
our struggles, we

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.740 align:middle line:90%
find sometimes our superpowers.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.630 align:middle line:84%
You see, my two big
challenges growing up

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.765 align:middle line:84%
were learning and
public speaking.

00:36:53.765 --> 00:36:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And now, I think the universe
has a sense of humor.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Because what I do for
my mission, my Dharma?

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Is I public speak on this
thing called learning

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.980 align:middle line:90%
almost every single day.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say that
there's that phrase

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to make God
laugh, tell her your plans.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.500 align:middle line:90%
And so this wasn't my plan.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:90%
But this is my responsibility.

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking
about fear, a lot of people

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.250 align:middle line:90%
have a fear of responsibility.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was
going to dinner.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I got to introduce two of
my modern day superheroes

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:90%
together for dinner.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It was Stan Lee and
Richard Branson.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.027 align:middle line:84%
And I remember in
the back of the car,

00:37:33.027 --> 00:37:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I was asking Stan I was
like, you've created

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.310 align:middle line:90%
this pantheon of superheroes.

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:90%
Who's your favorite?

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:90%
And he says, Jim, it's Iron Man.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Jim,
who's your favorite?

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said mine is Spider Man.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.357 align:middle line:84%
Because Stan had this
great Spider Man tie.

00:37:44.357 --> 00:37:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I said Spider
Man, he looked right at me.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, Jim, with great power
comes great responsibility.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
heard that before.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't even remember
where we heard it.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.190 align:middle line:90%
But my mind inverts things.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I have a slight dyslexia
growing up as a kid.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.932 align:middle line:84%
I still kind of move
things around in my mind.

00:38:00.932 --> 00:38:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
Stan, you're right.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.900 align:middle line:84%
With great power comes
great responsibility.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.510 align:middle line:90%
And the opposite is also true.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.470 align:middle line:84%
With great responsibility
comes great power.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:84%
That when we take
responsibility for something,

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.150 align:middle line:84%
we have great power
to make things better.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think that a lot of
people fear that responsibility.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they feel like
responsibility is a jailer.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.380 align:middle line:84%
By having extra responsibility,
it puts you in a prison.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.012 align:middle line:90%
You have to have discipline.

00:38:24.012 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But if you can't
get yourself to do

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.950 align:middle line:84%
the things that you need to do,
then you're really in prison.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.590 align:middle line:84%
If you can't get yourself
to meditate, or journal,

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:33.900 align:middle line:84%
or eat the right
foods, or exercise,

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.110 align:middle line:84%
or prime your mind every
single day, to create not only

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:41.680 align:middle line:84%
your to do list, but also your
to be list, your to feel list,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.575 align:middle line:84%
if you will, your
gratitude list.

00:38:43.575 --> 00:38:44.700 align:middle line:90%
You have your vision board.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But where's your
gratitude board?

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Because gratitude
rewires your brain.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody wants to
level up their learning

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and level up their life, really
uncover their deep potential,

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:56.490 align:middle line:84%
really a big part of it comes
down to routines and habits.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Because anywhere from 40% to
60% of our day is spent doing

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:84%
routines, doing
things unconsciously.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that
first, we create our habits.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.805 align:middle line:90%
And then our habits create us.

00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:07.680 align:middle line:90%
We create our habits.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And then our habits
create us right back.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But how many people
actually sat down

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.335 align:middle line:84%
and designed the
habits that are really

00:39:12.335 --> 00:39:14.530 align:middle line:84%
going to help them live
their fullest potential?

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.470 align:middle line:84%
The habits that are
most important to me

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.420 align:middle line:84%
are those habits first
thing in the morning.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Because as they say, if
you want to win the day,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.900 align:middle line:84%
you have to win that
first hour of the day.

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And so every single morning,
I have specific habits

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.900 align:middle line:84%
to really jumpstart my
mind, to conquer my mind,

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to master my mind, if you will.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.925 align:middle line:84%
Because that's going to
control everything else.

00:39:31.925 --> 00:39:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
the first thing I

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.510 align:middle line:84%
do when I wake up in the
morning is I remember my dreams.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.552 align:middle line:84%
I have a process for
remembering all my dreams.

00:39:38.552 --> 00:39:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, Jim,
what does that have

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.210 align:middle line:84%
to do with human potential
and being your best

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and being a lead
mental performer?

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people
don't know this,

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:47.580 align:middle line:84%
but you go through your
day learning all day.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.413 align:middle line:84%
You go through your day
trying to figure out

00:39:49.413 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:84%
challenges as an
entrepreneur, or as a parent.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.552 align:middle line:84%
Your brain doesn't
shut off at night.

00:39:54.552 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:84%
If anything, your brain
is more active at night.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So many times, you'll come
up with answers at night.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.410 align:middle line:90%
You'll come up with solutions.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:04.372 align:middle line:84%
You come up with inventions,
works of art, in your mind.

00:40:04.372 --> 00:40:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is when
you wake up the next day,

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:90%
you forget those things.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.808 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big challenge.

00:40:08.808 --> 00:40:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So for example, a
lot of people don't

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:84%
know a lot of
literature, culture,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:90%
art was created in dream states.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Mary Shelley
came up with "Frankenstein"

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:90%
in her dreams.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.040 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Paul McCartney came up with
"Yesterday" in his dream.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.055 align:middle line:84%
Elais Howard created the
sewing machine in his dream.

00:40:26.055 --> 00:40:28.530 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's absolutely amazing.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.110 align:middle line:84%
The periodic table came
to a chemist in his dream.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.288 align:middle line:84%
And so what are you
dreaming about late at night

00:40:34.288 --> 00:40:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that you forget about
first thing in the morning?

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.288 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be able
to remember your dreams.

00:40:38.288 --> 00:40:39.750 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
I do is when you

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.000 align:middle line:84%
talk about habits and routines
and being at your best,

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.867 align:middle line:90%
is I make my bed.

00:40:42.867 --> 00:40:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, Jim, what does
that have to do with anything?

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Make your bed?

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.890 align:middle line:90%
And the reason why is twofold.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Number one, I believe
how you do anything

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.765 align:middle line:90%
is how you do everything.

00:40:51.765 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:84%
How you do anything is
how you do everything.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.227 align:middle line:90%
And success breeds success.

00:40:55.227 --> 00:40:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And why not start with
a win that only takes

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:84%
you one or two minutes
to be able to do that?

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And the other reason
you do this is,

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.940 align:middle line:84%
how wonderful is the
feeling that you come back

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.610 align:middle line:84%
after a hard day's work and
you come back to success,

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:90%
you come back to your bed?

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.762 align:middle line:90%
So you go full circle.

00:41:08.762 --> 00:41:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I do every single
morning in terms of habits,

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.210 align:middle line:84%
routine, is I brush my teeth
with the opposite hand,

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:90%
with the opposite hand.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:84%
You're like, Jim, what does
that have to do with anything?

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Why would you use
your opposite hand?

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.015 align:middle line:84%
It's more difficult.
That is the reason why.

00:41:21.015 --> 00:41:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Because you train yourself.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.250 align:middle line:84%
How you do anything is
how you do everything.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So you to get comfortable
being uncomfortable.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.030 align:middle line:90%
Because if you put limits--

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lee has this
phrase that says,

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:84%
if you put limits
on any of your life,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.902 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to pervade
other areas of your life.

00:41:33.902 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So I want to challenge
myself constantly.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But the other reason I use
the opposite hand is it

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:39.750 align:middle line:84%
engages the opposite
side of your brain.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
builds brain muscles.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Because as your body
moves, your brain grooves.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.870 align:middle line:84%
They did a study at
Oxford University,

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:90%
where they had jugglers.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.320 align:middle line:84%
They found jugglers
actually had bigger brains.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They created more white
matter in their brains.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Because as you move
your body, it actually

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:54.990 align:middle line:84%
stimulates different
parts of your brain.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just the
brain body connection.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a body brain connection.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
science is telling us.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I do every single
morning is I take cold showers.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking, Jim,
I loved this up to now.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.620 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say cold showers?

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But we know cold therapy is
something that's very powerful.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of high achievers do that,
including [INAUDIBLE],, right?

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Because it resets your
nervous system and lowers

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.770 align:middle line:90%
inflammation in your body.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's a cold
shower or cryo therapy,

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:90%
you know, you hit your knee.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:23.250 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do?

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.050 align:middle line:90%
You put ice on it.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it reduces the
swelling and inflammation.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.932 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with your
body and your brain.

00:42:27.932 --> 00:42:29.640 align:middle line:84%
The other reason why
I take cold showers,

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.920 align:middle line:84%
besides the
physiological effects,

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.450 align:middle line:90%
is a psychological effects.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.885 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.760 align:middle line:84%
How you do anything is
how you do everything.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you put yourself in
difficult situation, something

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.133 align:middle line:84%
that's uncomfortable, but
still not life threatening,

00:42:42.133 --> 00:42:43.050 align:middle line:90%
and you push yourself.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times in
that shower, even to this day,

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I want
to get out of this.

00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:84%
My body is screaming,
get out, get out of this!

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But when you calm yourself and
you bring centeredness to it

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and you resist that,
then all of a sudden,

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that pervades other
areas of your life.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to
have more confidence.

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.300 align:middle line:84%
It gives you more
resilience and more grit

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.655 align:middle line:84%
when you're at your
job, when you're onstage

00:43:02.655 --> 00:43:05.030 align:middle line:84%
teaching something, when you
need to be there confidently

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:06.120 align:middle line:90%
with your child.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.500 align:middle line:90%
That really shows up.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.245 align:middle line:84%
So you do it for physiological
reasons, for inflammation.

00:43:10.245 --> 00:43:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But you also do it for
psychological reasons.

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.578 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
building resilience.

00:43:13.578 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:84%
You're building
grit, also as well.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Recently, I was with
actor Will Smith.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.790 align:middle line:90%
And I was interviewing him.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:90%
And we were preparing.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:84%
He's like, so what
are you doing now?

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm going to
read, finish this book.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to go for a run.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:27.717 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, do you
do that every day?

00:43:27.717 --> 00:43:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I was like, yes, every
single day I read and I run.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:30.850 align:middle line:90%
I do something mentally.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:32.700 align:middle line:90%
And I do something physically.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the shoots we
were doing was late at night.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:90%
It was filming late at night.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow, at
3:00, 4:00 in the morning,

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.250 align:middle line:84%
how do you get ready,
just, you know,

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.700 align:middle line:84%
when they say, OK, Will, you're
on set, how do you get ready?

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.310 align:middle line:84%
He was like, Jim, I
don't have to get ready.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I stay ready.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to get ready.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I stay ready.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And really, what
this tells me is

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.560 align:middle line:84%
that when you live your purpose
and you're living your mission,

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.540 align:middle line:84%
you're living what you
teach, really there's

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.465 align:middle line:90%
a congruency there.

00:43:58.465 --> 00:43:59.340 align:middle line:90%
There's an alignment.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And people could feel that.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
life that you live

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.620 align:middle line:90%
are the lessons that we teach.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.750 align:middle line:84%
The life that we live
are the lessons we teach.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:08.460 align:middle line:90%
You have this thing in your--

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.190 align:middle line:84%
speaking of learning,
children-- they don't

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:12.700 align:middle line:90%
do what you tell them to do.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.090 align:middle line:84%
They do what you do, because
they have these things,

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.160 align:middle line:84%
just like adults do,
called mirror neurons.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And mirror neurons are
these imitation neurons.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.750 align:middle line:84%
When you see something-- you're
watching a sporting event

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.070 align:middle line:84%
or you're watching
a television show,

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:24.960 align:middle line:84%
you can actually feel what
the main character feels,

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.668 align:middle line:84%
because you have that
empathy, and that's

00:44:26.668 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:90%
driven by your mirror neurons.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
it's so important

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to be around positive people--
people that challenge you,

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:90%
your peer group.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Select the peer
group very carefully,

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.230 align:middle line:84%
because they say you're the
average of the five people

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:38.540 align:middle line:90%
you spend most time with.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Who you spend time
with is who you become.

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And a big part of that
are the mirror neurons.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:43.650 align:middle line:84%
You start adopting
the same beliefs.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You start adopting
the same values.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.657 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
your health, it's

00:44:46.657 --> 00:44:48.450 align:middle line:84%
not just your biological
networks or even

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.210 align:middle line:90%
your neurological networks.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.960 align:middle line:90%
They're your social networks.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And so whether or not
you smoke has little

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.390 align:middle line:84%
to do with your biology, but
does your friend's friend

00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:58.410 align:middle line:90%
smoke?

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Because that all gets
imprinted on ourself.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:04.455 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're talking about
habits, a lot of my habits

00:45:04.455 --> 00:45:06.330 align:middle line:84%
get me in a place where
I feel uncomfortable.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to feel
comfortable being uncomfortable.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So another thing I do is I
have a tall glass of water,

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.100 align:middle line:90%
because your body is 70% water.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.163 align:middle line:90%
Your brain is 70% water.

00:45:15.163 --> 00:45:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And you want to be
able to hydrate that.

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is only about
2% of your body mass,

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.530 align:middle line:84%
but it requires 20%
of the nutrients,

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:22.580 align:middle line:90%
and so it requires that.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you're
completely hydrated.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'll do that and some
of my probiotics and so on.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.485 align:middle line:84%
I then I'll have a
brain power smoothie.

00:45:28.485 --> 00:45:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking, what's
a brain power smoothie?

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have my top 10
favorite brain foods,

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.590 align:middle line:90%
because you are what you eat.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:36.670 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Literally what you
eat becomes you.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.555 align:middle line:84%
Especially the things
that you could actually

00:45:40.555 --> 00:45:42.850 align:middle line:84%
assimilate, not the food
that you can't assimilate.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So-- but maybe you are
what you assimilate

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.810 align:middle line:90%
and can actually absorb.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:47.930 align:middle line:90%
But you are what you eat.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:49.450 align:middle line:90%
And so eat a good brain diet.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.130 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about the
brain, again, it's

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:54.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's the control
center for your relationships,

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.360 align:middle line:84%
for your career, for your
mission-- for all the things

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.920 align:middle line:90%
that are important in your life.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And so some of my top 10
favorite brain foods--

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:middle line:90%
avocados.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good for your brain.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Number two, I would
say blueberries.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:09.220 align:middle line:90%
I call them brain berries.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.630 align:middle line:90%
Number three, broccoli.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Your mom was right.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Broccoli is very
good for your brain.

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:90%
After that, coconut oil.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good for your brain.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Eggs-- very good for your brain.

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.950 align:middle line:90%
The essential fatty acids.

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Green leafy vegetables--
very neuroprotective.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.780 align:middle line:90%
Wild salmon-- wild salmon.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about fish oils.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.130 align:middle line:90%
As so I would say, wild salmon.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Sardines-- very
good for the brain.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric-- extremely
good for the brain.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Very anti-inflammatory.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I like to make a
golden tea, if you will,

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.800 align:middle line:90%
or a golden milk using turmeric.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:84%
You always put some
pepper in there,

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.800 align:middle line:84%
because it helps you to be able
to absorb it better as well.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Some people like honey--
some almond milk as a base.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:52.058 align:middle line:84%
Another great food for the
brain are actually walnuts.

00:46:52.058 --> 00:46:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Walnuts are very
good for your brain.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And even if you notice,
when you look at a walnut,

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.020 align:middle line:90%
it looks like what?

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.640 align:middle line:90%
It looks like the human brain.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in natures,
there's certain foods

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that they actually communicate
what organs they serve.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you take
a carrot and you cut it,

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.620 align:middle line:84%
it actually looks
like an eyeball.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an
interesting signature

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.450 align:middle line:90%
that nature has-- a signature.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:13.840 align:middle line:84%
A sign of nature--
they tell you the sign

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.610 align:middle line:90%
of where it's going to heal.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Dark chocolate-- you know
I saved the best for last.

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:20.732 align:middle line:84%
Dark chocolate-- the
darker, the better.

00:47:20.732 --> 00:47:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's going to
be good for your mood,

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.840 align:middle line:84%
generally it's going to be good
for your mind also, as well.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I'll do
every morning is I'll

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.050 align:middle line:84%
take some of my
favorite brain foods

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'll throw them
into a blender.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.133 align:middle line:90%
So I'll put the avocados.

00:47:32.133 --> 00:47:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I'll put the
blueberries in there.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.008 align:middle line:84%
I'll put some
coconut oil in there.

00:47:35.008 --> 00:47:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll spit some green
leafy vegetables in there.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I'll put some soaked walnuts
in there, some dark chocolate.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I won't put the wild salmon
in there or the eggs,

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.460 align:middle line:84%
but I make a brain
power smoothie.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm drinking
my brain power smoothie,

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.450 align:middle line:84%
now what I'm doing
is I'm journaling.

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.300 align:middle line:90%
And this is where I take time.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And my journaling has to do
with a lot around gratitude.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I list the things that
I'm most grateful for.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Because gratitude,
again, rewires the brain.

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Because what you tend to
appreciate appreciates.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.220 align:middle line:84%
What you appreciate appreciates
and grows in your life.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I write
those things down.

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything from the
fact that I could see,

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:16.300 align:middle line:84%
the things with my physiology,
my health, the people,

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.190 align:middle line:84%
my mission-- the people
I'm helping, also, as well.

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:20.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my gratitude journal.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also listing
also the things

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:24.203 align:middle line:90%
that I want to do that day.

00:48:24.203 --> 00:48:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I do three things personally,
three things professionally.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Those are my wins for the day.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And notice, I don't
even check my email.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the
worst habits people

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.390 align:middle line:84%
could have-- if they want to
be in a lead mental performer

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.348 align:middle line:84%
and they want to reach
their fullest potential,

00:48:36.348 --> 00:48:38.560 align:middle line:84%
do not touch your phone
the first hour of the day.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And people-- and I'll say
this and a lot of people--

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:44.410 align:middle line:84%
because we're all addicted
to our digital devices--

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.070 align:middle line:90%
is because for two reasons.

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it rewires
your brain, number one,

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.597 align:middle line:90%
for distraction.

00:48:49.597 --> 00:48:51.430 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up first
thing in the morning,

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.050 align:middle line:84%
you're in this brainwave
state called alpha theta.

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Alpha theta states are the
states of relaxed awareness.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.230 align:middle line:90%
You're extremely impressionable.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you're going on your
smart devices, and every time

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.240 align:middle line:84%
you get a like or a
share or a comment

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.878 align:middle line:84%
or you're watching another
cat video, whatever, you're

00:49:06.878 --> 00:49:08.170 align:middle line:90%
getting this flood of dopamine.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's training you
to be more distracted.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And we know this right,
we live in a world

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.110 align:middle line:90%
full of distractions.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:16.540 align:middle line:84%
App notifications,
social media alerts--

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and it was designed, actually,
out of Stanford University.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Dr. BJ Fogg, who runs the
Influence Lab in Stanford

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:28.060 align:middle line:84%
University-- one of his students
actually created Instagram.

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
device that you're--

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:32.600 align:middle line:84%
this is an app that we're
opening up 150, 200 times

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.400 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Highly addictive,
highly habitual.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But his expertise is
in this area of habit.

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Habit creation, if you will.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.680 align:middle line:84%
He has this formula
called B=MAT.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.230 align:middle line:84%
B equals M-A-T. And if you
want to change your habit,

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:46.030 align:middle line:90%
it starts--

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:47.663 align:middle line:84%
the behavior is
the habit itself.

00:49:47.663 --> 00:49:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to be
able to change that,

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:52.350 align:middle line:84%
what creates a habit
or a behavior is M-A-T.

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:54.760 align:middle line:84%
M is motivation,
because you can't

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:84%
change a habit unless
you're motivated to do so.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you want to
make exercise a habit, eating

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.500 align:middle line:84%
right a habit, journaling
or meditating a habit,

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.250 align:middle line:84%
you need to check in
with your motivation.

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.753 align:middle line:84%
On a scale of 0 to
10, where are you

00:50:08.753 --> 00:50:10.420 align:middle line:84%
in your level of
motivation-- your drive

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.735 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do that
activity, if you will?

00:50:12.735 --> 00:50:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing
about this is,

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.460 align:middle line:84%
if it's a five,
ask yourself, well,

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.390 align:middle line:84%
what do I need to do in my mind
to make it a six or a seven?

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:21.155 align:middle line:84%
And you could play
these little brain hack

00:50:21.155 --> 00:50:22.780 align:middle line:84%
games to be able to
level up, like it's

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.310 align:middle line:90%
a video game inside your mind.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:28.310 align:middle line:84%
The A in this formula stands
for ability-- ability.

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And you have
training in that area

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.002 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do that behavior.

00:50:32.002 --> 00:50:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So going back to,
let's say your behavior

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.710 align:middle line:84%
is you want to be able
to read every single day.

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you have the ability to read?

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Do you have
opportunities to read?

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the T-- this is
the big one in the formula.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:47.000 align:middle line:84%
The T in B=MAT when creating
new habits stands for trigger.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And triggers are important to me
in my work as a memory expert,

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:52.440 align:middle line:84%
because everything
serves as a reminder.

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.350 align:middle line:84%
You can forget something
during the day.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:55.370 align:middle line:84%
You're like, what was
that actor's name?

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.427 align:middle line:90%
Or what did I need to do?

00:50:56.427 --> 00:50:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And later on, you're
driving your car.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.177 align:middle line:90%
All of sudden, what happens?

00:50:59.177 --> 00:51:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It just pops in your mind.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.145 align:middle line:84%
Usually there's an
unconscious trigger--

00:51:02.145 --> 00:51:03.770 align:middle line:84%
maybe a song that
goes off or something

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:06.395 align:middle line:84%
you see on the side of the road
that unconsciously reminded you

00:51:06.395 --> 00:51:08.228 align:middle line:84%
of the thing that's
inside of your mind

00:51:08.228 --> 00:51:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that you needed to
be able to recall.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:11.330 align:middle line:84%
But the trigger is
basically saying,

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.340 align:middle line:84%
what prompts you
to do that habit?

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So for example, I don't like
digital devices so much.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.950 align:middle line:84%
They're convenient,
but they also cripple.

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:20.867 align:middle line:84%
And we have this thing
called digital dementia

00:51:20.867 --> 00:51:23.580 align:middle line:84%
where we're outsourcing our
brains to our smart devices.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Think about how many phone
numbers you knew growing up.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:26.960 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:27.890 align:middle line:90%
All of them, right?

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:29.900 align:middle line:84%
How many phone numbers
do you know right now?

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.388 align:middle line:90%
One, maybe two.

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge
is, is I don't want

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:34.860 align:middle line:84%
to memorize hundreds
of phone numbers,

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.100 align:middle line:84%
but we've lost the ability
just to memorize one.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.750 align:middle line:90%
They call it digital dementia.

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that we're using our
smart devices so much to keep

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.120 align:middle line:84%
our to-dos, our schedules,
our grocery list,

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.760 align:middle line:84%
do simple math for us, remember
all the phone numbers--

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.650 align:middle line:84%
so our brains lost
the ability to be

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.130 align:middle line:90%
able to do those tasks ourself.

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:52.040 align:middle line:90%
It's just like GPS.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.430 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to Dr. Daniel
Amen, the famous brain doctor.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.200 align:middle line:84%
He says, Jim, with
GPS, we're not

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.270 align:middle line:84%
getting early
detection of dementia

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.580 align:middle line:84%
because if you're relying
on a piece of technology

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:03.387 align:middle line:84%
to tell you where
and when to turn,

00:52:03.387 --> 00:52:05.720 align:middle line:84%
you're not realizing when you
would have a memory lapse.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.845 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to
doctors to get checked out.

00:52:07.845 --> 00:52:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of the digital
dementia, this growing--

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
three major challenges

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:16.670 align:middle line:84%
that the world's never faced
before in this digital age.

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:18.282 align:middle line:90%
Number one is digital overload.

00:52:18.282 --> 00:52:19.865 align:middle line:84%
Too much information,
too little time.

00:52:19.865 --> 00:52:22.713 align:middle line:84%
The amount of information is
doubling at dizzying speeds.

00:52:22.713 --> 00:52:25.130 align:middle line:84%
The chairman of Google says
that the amount of information

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that's been created from
the dawn of humanity

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to the year 2003, which is
only about a decade and a half

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.260 align:middle line:84%
ago-- that amount of information
now is created every two

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:34.520 align:middle line:90%
days online.

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Think about all the podcasts,
and all the blog posts,

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:39.323 align:middle line:84%
and all the YouTube videos, and
all the books and everything--

00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:40.250 align:middle line:90%
so much information.

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's doubling
at dizzying speeds.

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.325 align:middle line:84%
But how we learn it--
has that changed?

00:52:45.325 --> 00:52:47.030 align:middle line:84%
How we learn it, how
we read it, how we

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.140 align:middle line:90%
recall it-- has that changed?

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So that growing gap creates
a big health concern

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:53.540 align:middle line:90%
called information anxiety.

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Higher blood pressure,
compression of leisure time,

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.100 align:middle line:90%
more sleeplessness.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Even if people have some
free time or something

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.000 align:middle line:84%
frees up in their
life-- a meeting

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.812 align:middle line:84%
gets canceled-- they
can't even enjoy it,

00:53:03.812 --> 00:53:06.020 align:middle line:84%
because their mind is still
multitasking and thinking

00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:90%
of other things.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Because we're wired to be busy.

00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Because people all of the
time-- they say-- and you're

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.350 align:middle line:90%
used to saying, I'm so busy.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And how is it today?

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm just so busy.

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're using that
as a badge of honor,

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:17.597 align:middle line:90%
meaning it's an identity.

00:53:17.597 --> 00:53:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're seeing
themselves as busy in it.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:20.630 align:middle line:90%
But here's the challenge.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.737 align:middle line:90%
If you're seeing yourself and--

00:53:22.737 --> 00:53:24.320 align:middle line:84%
because here's the
unconscious message

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.445 align:middle line:90%
you're sending to somebody.

00:53:25.445 --> 00:53:29.240 align:middle line:84%
When you're saying you're busy,
you're getting secondary gain.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And that secondary
gain sympathy,

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.710 align:middle line:84%
or it's a feeling of
you're significant.

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you're so busy,
you must be important.

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's fulfilling these needs.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we are always
wanting to be busy,

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.720 align:middle line:90%
if that's your identity.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.940 align:middle line:84%
But here's the disservice
you give yourself, is this.

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:46.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're always
identifying with being busy,

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:48.590 align:middle line:84%
you're going to organize
your life to always be busy.

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:50.602 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder why you
don't have peace of mind.

00:53:50.602 --> 00:53:52.310 align:middle line:84%
You wonder why you
don't have a calmness.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I really think
that's the real currency,

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.230 align:middle line:84%
is your attention,
is your presence,

00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is your confidence,
and this level

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of calmness in an age of storms
with digital distractions.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So number one, digital overload
creates information anxiety.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:10.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why learning how to
learn faster is so important.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.430 align:middle line:84%
The other digital concern I
have is digital distraction--

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:15.578 align:middle line:84%
this idea that nobody
can concentrate.

00:54:15.578 --> 00:54:17.870 align:middle line:84%
They say that human beings
now have less attention span

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:19.195 align:middle line:90%
than a goldfish.

00:54:19.195 --> 00:54:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big challenge,
because how are you going

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:22.460 align:middle line:90%
to build a quality of life?

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.710 align:middle line:84%
How are you to get things
that are most important done

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:27.290 align:middle line:84%
if you can't even focus on the
thing that's in front of you?

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:29.498 align:middle line:84%
How many of us read a page
in a book, get to the end,

00:54:29.498 --> 00:54:31.017 align:middle line:84%
and just forgot
what we just read?

00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:33.350 align:middle line:84%
How many people are meeting
somebody for the first time,

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:34.280 align:middle line:90%
and they don't remember a name?

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Not because they don't
have a great memory.

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
looking over their shoulder

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to see who else is important,
because they're not present.

00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:42.170 align:middle line:84%
How many people here, they're
not even-- looking around?

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're looking at
you, they're not really there,

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:45.770 align:middle line:84%
because they're
talking to themselves.

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:46.687 align:middle line:90%
They're not listening.

00:54:46.687 --> 00:54:48.888 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting for
their turn to speak,

00:54:48.888 --> 00:54:51.180 align:middle line:84%
or they're thinking about
how they're going to respond.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of my very favorite
books is by Dr. Stephen Covey--

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.477 align:middle line:84%
"The Seven Habits of
Highly Effective People."

00:54:56.477 --> 00:54:58.268 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
habits-- we're going back

00:54:58.268 --> 00:55:00.680 align:middle line:84%
to habits and routines of
the most effective people.

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.450 align:middle line:84%
One of them says, seek
first to understand,

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.060 align:middle line:90%
then to be understood.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Seek first to understand,
then to be understood.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Like for example,
remembering names.

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:11.450 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the biggest
memory challenges people have.

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's
not your retention.

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.770 align:middle line:90%
It's your attention.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.150 align:middle line:90%
It's your observation.

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember I got to
spend some time recently

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:21.710 align:middle line:90%
with President Bill Clinton.

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting at
a fundraiser together.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And I'd met him previously
before, just for a few minutes.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And he remembered my
name, after one meeting.

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:32.170 align:middle line:84%
He remembered our
conversation that we had.

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:34.173 align:middle line:84%
And that's a standout
skill, right?

00:55:34.173 --> 00:55:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
can't do that.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And I remember asking
him, President Clinton,

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:39.350 align:middle line:90%
how do you do that?

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.248 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a memory
expert, you know.

00:55:41.248 --> 00:55:42.790 align:middle line:84%
What memory techniques
are you using?

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:44.748 align:middle line:84%
He says, Jim, I'm not
using a memory technique.

00:55:44.748 --> 00:55:47.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, growing up in
Arkansas, our grandfather

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.810 align:middle line:84%
would tell stories
to all the children.

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards, he would
do something different.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.220 align:middle line:84%
He would quiz each
of us separately

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:56.360 align:middle line:84%
to see if we were
really paying attention.

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And he tells me all
these wonderful stories.

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And I notice when
he's talking to me,

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.210 align:middle line:90%
he's really there with me.

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:02.650 align:middle line:84%
He's not looking
over my shoulder

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:04.120 align:middle line:90%
and seeing who else is here.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.920 align:middle line:84%
You could tell he's
really listening.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
interesting, because I

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:10.930 align:middle line:84%
feel like his incredible memory
and the powerful presence

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:14.830 align:middle line:84%
he has with people comes from
being powerfully present.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:17.260 align:middle line:84%
That his incredible memory
and his powerful presence

00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:20.260 align:middle line:84%
comes from being
powerfully present.

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.672 align:middle line:90%
And we could all do that.

00:56:21.672 --> 00:56:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking about
even just boosting our memory,

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.200 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
being motivated.

00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.297 align:middle line:90%
Going back to motivation.

00:56:27.297 --> 00:56:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Asking yourself, why do
you want to remember this?

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.338 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want to remember
this person's name?

00:56:31.338 --> 00:56:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's to make a
connection-- make a new friend

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.417 align:middle line:84%
or create a business
relationship.

00:56:36.417 --> 00:56:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's to practice
these techniques I learned.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.542 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the thing.

00:56:39.542 --> 00:56:42.340 align:middle line:84%
If you can't come up one reason,
you won't remember things.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Because reasons reap results.

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Reasons reap results.

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
success formula.

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.470 align:middle line:90%
I call it H Cubed.

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Goes from your head to
your heart to your hands.

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So we could visualize
things all day.

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:55.420 align:middle line:90%
We could set goals all day.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.820 align:middle line:84%
We could have our
dreams in our mind.

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not acting with
our hands, something's going on.

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Something is missing,
because we're self-sabotaging

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.810 align:middle line:90%
or we're procrastinating.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we acting with our
hands when it's in our head?

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Usually what's missing is the
second H, which is the heart.

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.340 align:middle line:84%
The heart is a
symbol of emotion--

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.810 align:middle line:90%
the energy of motion.

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't steer
a car that has no fuel.

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.490 align:middle line:90%
So where's the fuel?

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:19.720 align:middle line:90%
You want to start with why.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And so we go back to motivation.

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was doing a
training in Silicon Valley.

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I was done, Bill
Gates comes up to me.

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.150 align:middle line:90%
And we have this--

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:30.142 align:middle line:84%
I always ask people what
their superpower is,

00:57:30.142 --> 00:57:32.350 align:middle line:84%
or if you have only one
superpower, what would it be.

00:57:32.350 --> 00:57:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, I would
love to read faster.

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.852 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, I could
totally help you with that.

00:57:36.852 --> 00:57:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And Warren Buffett
says, I probably

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.750 align:middle line:84%
wasted 10 years of my
life reading slowly.

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But we start talking about
the future of education.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And I take it from
a learning how

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.120 align:middle line:84%
to learn perspective--
accelerated

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.110 align:middle line:90%
learning perspective.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:50.110 align:middle line:84%
He takes it from more of
a technology perspective.

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:52.837 align:middle line:84%
And somebody who was listening
to our conversation was saying,

00:57:52.837 --> 00:57:53.920 align:middle line:90%
is there anything missing?

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.200 align:middle line:84%
You have the theory
and you have the tools.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.593 align:middle line:84%
And we talked
about it some more,

00:57:57.593 --> 00:57:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and we came up with
the same conclusion.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.280 align:middle line:90%
It's motivation.

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.118 align:middle line:90%
Understanding human motivation.

00:58:02.118 --> 00:58:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the thing.

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people know
what to do, but they

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:06.390 align:middle line:90%
don't do what they know.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:09.005 align:middle line:84%
Because common sense is
not often common practice.

00:58:09.005 --> 00:58:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And usually, what's missing,
if you procrastinate and put

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.720 align:middle line:84%
things off, is understanding
your emotions--

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.550 align:middle line:84%
tapping into what's
most important to you.

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Going back to your values,
going back to your beliefs,

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.210 align:middle line:90%
going to thte things--

00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:22.810 align:middle line:84%
even sometimes it's their
fears that drive people

00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:25.210 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the things that
they're moving away from

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:28.480 align:middle line:84%
or the things that they're
moving towards, also as well.

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.880 align:middle line:84%
People come to me
all the time saying,

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.890 align:middle line:84%
how do I unlock
my full potential?

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:34.570 align:middle line:90%
And how can I be smarter?

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:35.920 align:middle line:90%
How can I raise my intelligence?

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.390 align:middle line:90%
How can I improve my memory?

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:40.173 align:middle line:84%
And science is saying,
about 1/3 of your potential

00:58:40.173 --> 00:58:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and your intelligence,
your memory

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:43.780 align:middle line:84%
is predetermined by
genetics and biology.

00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:46.540 align:middle line:84%
But that means 2/3 is
completely in your control.

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's really exciting news.

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:49.210 align:middle line:90%
And then there are 10 keys.

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So there are 10 keys for
unlocking your full potential.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:54.700 align:middle line:90%
Number one is a good diet.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:55.720 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Literally, what you
eat becomes you.

00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So eat the best
brain foods ever.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Number two is Killing ANTS.

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Killing ANTS is actually
clinically proven

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:05.320 align:middle line:90%
to unlock your potential.

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.680 align:middle line:84%
"ANTS" stands for automatic
negative thoughts--

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.120 align:middle line:90%
automatic negative thoughts.

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth is,
yes, you are what you eat,

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:13.787 align:middle line:90%
but you are also your thoughts.

00:59:13.787 --> 00:59:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to
keep them positive.

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:16.787 align:middle line:84%
You want to keep
them encouraging.

00:59:16.787 --> 00:59:18.820 align:middle line:84%
There are studies that
suggest that pessimists

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.200 align:middle line:90%
are more accurate.

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.370 align:middle line:90%
They're right more often.

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:23.477 align:middle line:84%
But optimists
achieve a lot more.

00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And think about it,
because pessimists

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:29.110 align:middle line:84%
are really risk-adverse,
so they play it safe.

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they're not getting as
much done and accomplished.

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But optimists are
taking more risks.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And with those
risks come rewards.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to getting
rid of negative thoughts,

00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:39.160 align:middle line:84%
what I would tell
people as this.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Is remember magic.

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Use your magic.

00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Abra-- A-B-R-A.
Remember abracadabra?

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Abracadabra is all about taking
words and changing things--

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.310 align:middle line:90%
transformational words.

00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a negative
talk, negative self-talk

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:53.825 align:middle line:84%
and negative limiting
belief, what I want you to do

00:59:53.825 --> 00:59:54.970 align:middle line:90%
are four simple things.

00:59:54.970 --> 00:59:57.385 align:middle line:90%
The A in abra says acknowledge.

00:59:57.385 --> 00:59:58.260 align:middle line:90%
You acknowledge that.

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you say something
like, oh, I'm just too old.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Or oh, I'm just--

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.130 align:middle line:90%
this doesn't run in my family.

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, I'm just not smart
enough or good enough.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Acknowledge it.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't resist it.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if you fight it,
what you resist persists.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.880 align:middle line:90%
So just acknowledge it.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.850 align:middle line:84%
The B in abra
stands for breathe.

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:18.280 align:middle line:90%
It stands for breath.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Because what you do
is you breathe in.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm breathing,
I'm visualizing.

01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:24.205 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
breath and visualization.

01:00:24.205 --> 01:00:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I breathe in potential.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.200 align:middle line:90%
I breathe in intelligence.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I breathe in limitless.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And I breathe into
the place of my body,

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
whether it's pain I'm suffering
from or struggling with

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:35.330 align:middle line:90%
or an idea in my mind--

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:36.860 align:middle line:90%
I breathe into that space.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the R in
abra is I release.

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I release.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I release that
negative thought--

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.090 align:middle line:90%
that automatic negative thought.

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.560 align:middle line:90%
I release that pain.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.660 align:middle line:90%
I release limits out.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the last A
in abra stands for align--

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.070 align:middle line:90%
align.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:53.030 align:middle line:90%
I reset.

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:54.800 align:middle line:90%
I do zero base.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
What's the opposite
of what I was feeling?

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Or what's the opposite of
what I was saying to myself?

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.950 align:middle line:84%
What's my true,
fullest potential?

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:02.982 align:middle line:84%
And I align more
to my true nature.

01:01:02.982 --> 01:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you could
do to be able to unlock

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.190 align:middle line:90%
your full potential is exercise.

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So exercise is really
good for the brain.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
As your body moves,
your brain grooves.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't know
this, but the primary function

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
of our brain is to
control our movement.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And here's what the latest
science is saying, is

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.010 align:middle line:84%
just there's not only just a
brain-body connection-- there's

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.300 align:middle line:90%
a body-brain connection.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is, is we're
so sedentary all the time.

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
We live in a very
sedentary culture.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
They say sitting
is the new smoking.

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage people
to take brain breaks.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.210 align:middle line:84%
The Pomodoro Technique
says that our focus--

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:37.670 align:middle line:84%
we can only maintain high
focus for about 25 minutes.

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:40.063 align:middle line:84%
After that, there's
a sharp decline.

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do
is I set an alarm

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.458 align:middle line:84%
to go off every 25 to 30
minutes-- maybe an hour, tops.

01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And then what I do is
I take a little brain

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
break-- a five-minute brain
break to do three things.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Number one, I hydrate.

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Number two, I do deep breathing.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
I do is I move.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
As your body moves,
your brain grooves.

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you could do
to maximize your potential

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:02.595 align:middle line:84%
are nutrients-- are
supplements-- nutrients.

01:02:02.595 --> 01:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Especially when it
comes to your brain.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do
all the techniques,

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.437 align:middle line:84%
but if you're deficient in
DHAs, omegas, your B vitamins,

01:02:10.437 --> 01:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
it's going to affect
your performance.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
getting the best diet,

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:14.330 align:middle line:90%
you could supplement.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Number five is a
positive peer group.

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Positive peer group is
really key to living

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.360 align:middle line:84%
in your full
potential, because you

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.740 align:middle line:90%
are who you spend time with.

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Literally who you spend
time with is who you become.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
After that, I would say
a clean environment.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Clean environment is
really good for your brain,

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
for you living your
fullest potential.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Because you know this.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.937 align:middle line:84%
If you ever clean your
desk or your laptop,

01:02:33.937 --> 01:02:35.270 align:middle line:90%
don't you have a more sharpness?

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Don't you have
clarity of thought?

01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So a clean environment
is reflective of clarity

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.490 align:middle line:90%
of thought.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Sleep-- this is the next one.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Number seven is sleep.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
You need sleep, especially
for your mental performance,

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.247 align:middle line:90%
for two reasons.

01:02:47.247 --> 01:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it's
where you consolidate

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:50.060 align:middle line:90%
short- to long-term memory.

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:50.860 align:middle line:90%
That's really key.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.735 align:middle line:84%
You need to consolidate
short to long memory.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:53.938 align:middle line:90%
That happens when you sleep.

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Number two, though, it's where
you're cleaning out the plaque

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that leads to dementia
and Alzheimer's.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.980 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when you sleep is
when you're actually doing that.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.813 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
reason-- a bonus reason--

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:05.482 align:middle line:90%
is it's when you dream.

01:03:05.482 --> 01:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that
deep sleep and you're

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:09.710 align:middle line:84%
dreaming-- we talked about the
power of all the amazing dreams

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that you're having and being
able to remember them--

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to make
sure you're dreaming.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
The eighth key-- another key to
unlocking your full potential

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:16.940 align:middle line:90%
is to protect your brain.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.990 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean?

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Wear a helmet.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Your brain-- coming from
somebody who's had many

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:23.990 align:middle line:84%
traumatic brain injuries,
falling off roofs headfirst

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.070 align:middle line:90%
into radiators--

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
your brain is resilient,
but it's also very fragile.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
So with you and your kids,
avoid the extreme sports.

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:31.730 align:middle line:90%
Wear a helmet.

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Wear your seat belt-- all those
things to protect your brain.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The next key for unlocking
your full mental potential

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.570 align:middle line:90%
is new learnings.

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Commit yourself to
lifelong learnings.

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:42.355 align:middle line:84%
There was a study
done on super nuns.

01:03:42.355 --> 01:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
It was on the cover
of "Time" magazine.

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to find out how
these women were living 80, 90,

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:47.803 align:middle line:90%
and above in age.

01:03:47.803 --> 01:03:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And they found
out, half of it had

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.845 align:middle line:84%
to do with their
gratitude-- going back

01:03:50.845 --> 01:03:52.010 align:middle line:90%
to gratitude and faith.

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The other half, though,
had to do with they

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:55.830 align:middle line:90%
were lifelong learners.

01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
They were committed
to lifelong learning,

01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:59.462 align:middle line:90%
learning every single day.

01:03:59.462 --> 01:04:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Because we've discovered
more about the human brain--

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
more in the past 20 years
than the previous 2,000 years.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.310 align:middle line:84%
With studies done neurogenesis
and neuroplasticity,

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:08.810 align:middle line:90%
neurogenesis says--

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
"neuro" meaning the brain,
"genesis" meaning birth.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
You could give birth to new
brain cells to the day you die.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity-- this
is really exciting-- says

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.280 align:middle line:84%
that your brain is like
plastic, in a positive way.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it's very malleable--
that having a new thought

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:22.980 align:middle line:90%
creates new connections.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Einstein's brain
wasn't any bigger than anybody

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.680 align:middle line:90%
else's.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.990 align:middle line:90%
If anything, it's smaller.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
parts of his brain

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.840 align:middle line:84%
that are extremely
dense, because he

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
wired his brain through his what
he called thought experiments.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.217 align:middle line:84%
He would visualize himself
riding a beam of light,

01:04:38.217 --> 01:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
looking at something and
wondering what that thing would

01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:42.087 align:middle line:90%
look like going at light speed.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:43.670 align:middle line:84%
He would do these
thought experiments.

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:45.560 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that
said imagination is

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.397 align:middle line:90%
more powerful than knowledge.

01:04:47.397 --> 01:04:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Because knowledge is what it is.

01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
But imagination is
what things could be.

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So commit yourself
to lifelong learning.

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And what stimulates neurogenesis
and neuroplasticity?

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Two things.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Novelty and nutrition.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.453 align:middle line:90%
Novelty and nutrition.

01:05:01.453 --> 01:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if you want to
build your physical muscles.

01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
If you want to build a
muscle, you give it novelty.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:07.010 align:middle line:90%
You work it out.

01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:08.110 align:middle line:90%
You give it exercise.

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you give in
nutrients to feed it.

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with
your mental muscles.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.258 align:middle line:84%
Give it novelty-- new--
things and then give it

01:05:13.258 --> 01:05:15.080 align:middle line:84%
the nutrients it
needs to develop.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the last
key for unlocking

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
your full mental potential
is stress management.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge one,
because a lot of people--

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.667 align:middle line:84%
because we live in such
stressed lives, we're like fish.

01:05:25.667 --> 01:05:27.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the water,
because we're in the water

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:28.740 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And we are living in
that sympathetic state.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important
for your brain

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:36.210 align:middle line:84%
to down-regulate-- to spend time
in those parasympathetic places

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:39.215 align:middle line:84%
where you rest and you
recover and you restore.

01:05:39.215 --> 01:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of
stress management,

01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
what kind of
practices do we have?

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Whether it's massage, whether--

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.900 align:middle line:90%
for me, it's meditation.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is a
very powerful way.

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.220 align:middle line:84%
When you meditate, you go
into this brainwave state

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:51.360 align:middle line:90%
called alpha.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.563 align:middle line:84%
Alpha state is the state
of a relaxed awareness.

01:05:54.563 --> 01:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And relaxed awareness
is where you

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
could train yourself actually
to learn a language faster--

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
to be able to learn rapidly,
because your conscious mind is

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.620 align:middle line:84%
actually set aside and you
just absorb information faster.

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:07.860 align:middle line:84%
You know what puts you
into an alpha state is TV--

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:08.790 align:middle line:90%
television.

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
They call it television
programming for a reason.

01:06:11.010 --> 01:06:12.677 align:middle line:84%
And you know this
because if you've ever

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:15.745 align:middle line:84%
seen somebody so enthralled with
a TV show or a sporting event,

01:06:15.745 --> 01:06:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to talk to
them or have a conversation,

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.318 align:middle line:90%
and they're just in trance--

01:06:19.318 --> 01:06:20.610 align:middle line:90%
literally, they don't hear you.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It's because their
conscious mind is set aside

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.595 align:middle line:84%
and they're just absorbing
what's in front of them.

01:06:24.595 --> 01:06:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And there are many ways to get
into an alpha state by design.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And I would recommend, use
all three learning styles--

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
visual, auditory,
and kinesthetic.

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you visualize
things and you--

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
so when you visualize things and
you exercise your imagination,

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
it actually puts you
into an alpha state--

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.210 align:middle line:90%
a relaxed state of awareness.

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And even if you can't
imagine something

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
when you're imagining, just
imagine you can imagine it.

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.740 align:middle line:90%
The auditory part is music.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Certain sounds,
like nature sounds,

01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
will put you into
an alpha state.

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Certain sounds, like
classical music, especially

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Baroque classical music--

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Vivaldi, Handel-- because
it's 60 beats per minute

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and it harmonizes with
the resting heart rate.

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So 60 beats per
minute Baroque music

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
will help put you into a
meditative alpha state.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And finally visual
auditory kinesthetic.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Kinesthetic, I would
say deep breathing.

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:16.223 align:middle line:84%
Deep, diaphragmatic,
conscious breathing.

01:07:16.223 --> 01:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And even when you're not
meditating, a lot of people

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:19.267 align:middle line:90%
have bad posture.

01:07:19.267 --> 01:07:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And when they're reading
something and they're studying,

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.920 align:middle line:84%
you can't live
your full potential

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.420 align:middle line:84%
if you're crouched
down like this.

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
have poor posture,

01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:27.660 align:middle line:90%
you collapse your lungs.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And the lower 1/3 of your lungs
absorbs 2/3 of the oxygen.

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And what's most important is
that oxygen gets to your brain.

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you suffer from
mental fatigue or brain fog,

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.210 align:middle line:84%
the number-one
thing you could do

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:41.370 align:middle line:84%
is do deep,
diaphragmatic breathing.

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.255 align:middle line:90%


01:07:44.255 --> 01:07:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's interesting, because
when you think about hypnosis--

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.270 align:middle line:84%
on a side bar, a really good
hypnotherapist will take you

01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:51.770 align:middle line:90%
through visualization.

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
They'll also have some kind
of music in the background.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And then in terms
of relaxing music

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and kinesthetic, deep,
diaphragmatic breathing--

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
it's visual,
auditory kinesthetic

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and you can go deeper in
terms of those alpha states.

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it is.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.987 align:middle line:84%
And hypnotherapy can
be really powerful.

01:08:06.987 --> 01:08:09.283 align:middle line:84%
My dad actually used it,
because he was not well

01:08:09.283 --> 01:08:10.200 align:middle line:90%
for a number of years.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And we helped him get
well, and hypnotherapy

01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:14.850 align:middle line:84%
was part of the training
later on in the process.

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's huge.

01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:18.060 align:middle line:90%
They've done hypnotherapy with--

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
they'll take people through
an age regression process,

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.979 align:middle line:84%
so when they were
nine years old.

01:08:21.979 --> 01:08:24.979 align:middle line:84%
And they could actually
read the signs off the road

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:26.850 align:middle line:90%
when the family vacations.

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
They'll do age
regression therapy

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:30.569 align:middle line:84%
where they'll take them back
to when they're seven or eight,

01:08:30.569 --> 01:08:31.369 align:middle line:90%
nine years old.

01:08:31.369 --> 01:08:33.439 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be able
remember with 95% accuracy

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
what day their ninth
birthday fell on.

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Like what day of the week.

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Because all that genius
is inside of you.

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
What I would say
to people is this.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.359 align:middle line:90%
I compare your life to an egg.

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:46.520 align:middle line:84%
That if an egg is broken by
an outside force, life ends.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.029 align:middle line:84%
But if it's broken by an
inside force, life begins.

01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
All great things
begin on the inside.

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:54.189 align:middle line:90%
You have genius inside of you.

01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
You have greatness
inside of you.

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:58.069 align:middle line:90%
Now is the time to unlock it.

01:08:58.069 --> 01:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not how smart you are
or how smart your kids are.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.180 align:middle line:90%
It's, how are they smart?

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Is that how smart you are.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.060 align:middle line:90%
It's, how are you smart?

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:06.979 align:middle line:84%
But traditional education--
we all grew up--

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
See, one of the reasons
why that keeps us

01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:11.090 align:middle line:84%
from living our
fullest potential

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:13.370 align:middle line:84%
is that we all grew up with
a 20th century education.

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:15.109 align:middle line:84%
And a 20th century
education prepared us

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
for a 20th century world, which
was following orders, working

01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
on farms, working in factories.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.310 align:middle line:84%
It was assembly line, cookie
cutter, one-size-fits-all,

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:24.649 align:middle line:84%
sit quietly by yourself,
don't talk to your neighbor.

01:09:24.649 --> 01:09:26.580 align:middle line:90%
But we live in an age--

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
Elon Musk, right?

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.649 align:middle line:84%
Autonomous electric
cars, and spaceships that

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:31.490 align:middle line:90%
are going to Mars.

01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
But our vehicle of choice
when it comes to learning

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:35.090 align:middle line:90%
is like a horse and buggy.

01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's trained us on
how to learn how to learn.

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:41.399 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's trained us on how
to unlock our natural powers.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that there's
a superhero in all of us.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.810 align:middle line:90%
I call it the superhero you.

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:48.399 align:middle line:84%
Is the best version
of ourselves.

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:50.149 align:middle line:84%
And the thing with
superheroes is not just

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:52.590 align:middle line:84%
about discovering and
developing your superpowers.

01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:53.390 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:55.880 align:middle line:84%
You want to discover and develop
your natural superpowers.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.770 align:middle line:84%
When I say superpowers, I
mean not shooting lasers out

01:09:58.770 --> 01:09:59.570 align:middle line:90%
of your eyes.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean your unique
ability-- your strength.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.590 align:middle line:90%
What are your talents?

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Because your uniqueness
is your superpower.

01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:08.840 align:middle line:84%
But just having a superpower
doesn't make you a superhero.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.860 align:middle line:84%
You have to use that
superpower for what?

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.660 align:middle line:90%
For good.

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.268 align:middle line:84%
You have to use it to save
the world-- to make an impact.

01:10:14.268 --> 01:10:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the two
reasons to learn anything.

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you learn it for
how it could benefit you.

01:10:18.510 --> 01:10:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But the other reason you
want to learn something

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
is so you can pay it forward
and help somebody else.

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I
talk about memory

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
so much when it comes to
unlocking your full potential

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.840 align:middle line:84%
is I believe that memory
really is who we are.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.260 align:middle line:90%
My grandmother passed away.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
When she died, she didn't
recognize who I was.

01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.700 align:middle line:90%
She had Alzheimer's.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And going to her and
wanting to comfort her,

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.050 align:middle line:84%
especially with my broken
brain, and I already felt like I

01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.943 align:middle line:90%
wasn't--

01:10:42.943 --> 01:10:44.360 align:middle line:84%
there was something
wrong with me.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
When she didn't
remember my name,

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.920 align:middle line:84%
it really affected
my life, because it's

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.713 align:middle line:90%
an inflection point.

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:53.660 align:middle line:84%
One experience can
make you take one step.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And one step in
another direction

01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
changes your destination
or your destiny.

01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I believe memory is
so important, because it's

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.510 align:middle line:90%
the superpower we all have.

01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But when we lose it, we
lose part of who we are.

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just remembering
facts and figures and formulas.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.710 align:middle line:90%
That's easy.

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:12.478 align:middle line:84%
But it's the three L's
that I really focus on.

01:11:12.478 --> 01:11:13.895 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
build your memory--

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
you want to have your
memory because you want

01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:18.050 align:middle line:90%
to remember your loved ones--

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
the people that matter
the most to you.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But you also-- the
second L is your life.

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if your life
is worth living,

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.850 align:middle line:90%
it's worth remembering--

01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:27.320 align:middle line:90%
those special moments.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And the third L that you
want to be able to remember

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.040 align:middle line:90%
are your lessons.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
We hear this quote
all the time--

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:34.070 align:middle line:90%
this definition of insanity.

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Insanity is doing the same thing
over and over and over again,

01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:38.880 align:middle line:84%
but expecting a
different result.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that's insanity.

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:42.170 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a poor memory.

01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:43.430 align:middle line:90%
That's a bad memory.

01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:45.560 align:middle line:84%
We tend to repeat things
over and over again.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Financially-- when
we spend money

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
the same way and we end up
making the same mistakes.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
We end up dating the same
people over and over again,

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.100 align:middle line:84%
because we lose the
memory and the remembrance

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
of that experience
when it hurt us.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe even when it comes
to our career or our diet.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
We start eating the same bad
foods, because of our memory.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:06.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't remember
how bad we felt

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.830 align:middle line:84%
when we ate that processed food
or that gluten-rich dessert

01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:11.600 align:middle line:90%
or that fried whatever.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And so the goal here
is to be able to--

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:17.943 align:middle line:84%
I really do believe that
your life transforms.

01:12:17.943 --> 01:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
If you want to live
your full potential,

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:21.890 align:middle line:84%
be the best version
of yourself, you

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:25.312 align:middle line:84%
have to identify more with a
thermostat than a thermometer.

01:12:25.312 --> 01:12:26.270 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
A thermometer-- the primary
function of the thermometer

01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:31.120 align:middle line:90%
is it reacts to the environment.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
It literally reacts
to environment.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.183 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the environment
is giving it,

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.300 align:middle line:90%
it just reflects that.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.940 align:middle line:90%
But a thermostat is different.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:38.420 align:middle line:90%
A thermostat sets a standard.

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.350 align:middle line:90%
It sets a vision.

01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:40.250 align:middle line:90%
It sets a goal.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:41.772 align:middle line:90%
It uses this imagination.

01:12:41.772 --> 01:12:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And all a sudden and what
happens to the environment?

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The environment
raises to become that.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what the
world needs today, are leaders.

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Leaders committed to
learning and to giving.

01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
modern-day superheroes do.

01:12:53.710 --> 01:12:56.730 align:middle line:84%
The modern-day superheroes, what
they get people is this hope.

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
have the courage

01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:01.440 align:middle line:84%
to be the best
version of yourself,

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
you give people unconsciously
that same permission

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.915 align:middle line:90%
to do the same.

01:13:04.915 --> 01:13:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what the world needs,

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:08.710 align:middle line:90%
is a world full of superheroes.

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So if your life is worth
living, it's worth remembering.

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And as I look at my life
from where it began,

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.200 align:middle line:84%
from immigrant parents
to having my head injury,

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to be made fun of, to go
through all the bullying,

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.020 align:middle line:84%
to feel like I'm not enough,
to not knowing how to read,

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.860 align:middle line:84%
to searching for my
superhero school as a child,

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
to be made fun of
because I couldn't public

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.860 align:middle line:84%
speak or I couldn't learn
like everybody else does--

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.260 align:middle line:84%
to be going from the boy
with the broken brain,

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and taking that whole
mess and making it

01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:41.670 align:middle line:90%
your message and your mission.

01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:43.955 align:middle line:84%
Where now, it's no
brain left behind.

01:13:43.955 --> 01:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Because I know--
the reason why I

01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
talk about the brain
and the human mind

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.840 align:middle line:84%
is we live in the
millennium of the mind.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:51.407 align:middle line:84%
Nobody here is paid
for their muscle power.

01:13:51.407 --> 01:13:52.740 align:middle line:90%
You're paid for your mind power.

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:53.948 align:middle line:90%
It's not your brute strength.

01:13:53.948 --> 01:13:55.320 align:middle line:90%
It's your brain strength.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But when you can align
this with this with this--

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.050 align:middle line:84%
your head, your heart your
hands-- magical things

01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:02.250 align:middle line:90%
could happen.

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, I feel so blessed.

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the power of
gratitude rewiring our brain.

01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Every single day, when I wake
up and I read these stories,

01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a child with
learning disabilities

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.800 align:middle line:84%
to seniors that feel
like that they're aging

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.740 align:middle line:84%
is really hurting them to some
of the modern day superheroes

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
I respect, that I

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
love learning from--
the superheroes

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.810 align:middle line:90%
that I've been seeking.

01:14:21.810 --> 01:14:23.430 align:middle line:84%
To be able to
coach them and work

01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:26.220 align:middle line:84%
with them and their
families and their teams--

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I love to be able
to impact people who

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.880 align:middle line:90%
are inspiring everybody.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think we all have
that ability when we take

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:34.270 align:middle line:90%
the responsibility to do so.

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
When we take-- going
back to Stan Lee saying,

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.010 align:middle line:84%
with great power comes
great responsibility.

01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:40.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe that with
great responsibility

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:41.790 align:middle line:90%
comes great power.

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:44.490 align:middle line:84%
When we take responsibility
for our lot in life,

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
we have great power to change
our lives and the lives

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:48.060 align:middle line:90%
of everyone around us.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Change our brain,
we change our life.

01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Change our brain, we
could change the world.
