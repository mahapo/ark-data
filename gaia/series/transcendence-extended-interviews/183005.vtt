00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, right now, when I
look back to my childhood,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.290 align:middle line:90%
I remember positive things.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I actually think that whatever
happened in my childhood,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:84%
it has helped shape me into
the person I am today, helped

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:84%
me to strengthen my
character features,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and to allow me to appreciate
and value everything in life

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Surely, there was a
lot of adversities

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of obstacles,
And a lot of doubts not

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.440 align:middle line:84%
going around whether
or not I will

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.470 align:middle line:84%
be able to succeed
in the tennis world.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
That was not as traditional or
popular back in our country.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.070 align:middle line:90%
Even though we're a country of--

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, we nurture
sports values,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:84%
we were a country of
team sports, mostly.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So I was four or five years old
when the first war in-- well,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that I was living in--

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
that was the war

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
that separated all the
ex-Yugoslavian countries.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been in
the epicenter of it,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:84%
but all of the countries
in ex-Yugoslavia

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
have felt the
consequence of that war.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the next
nine and 10 years,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Serbia has been through a
lot of economical trouble.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It was torn by the bombings
later on in the '90s

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.595 align:middle line:84%
and embargoes, sanctions,
people waiting in line for just

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
the most basic things, the
most common things like bread

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.540 align:middle line:90%
and milk.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, going
underground into shelters

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
to basically seek for
some kind of safety

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
because you never knew what
is going to happen next.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So one of the most
dramatic experiences

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
I've had with my family was
in '99 when we'd been through,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
day and night, two and a
half months of bombing.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't easy, not just for
us, but for the entire country.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And all our people, we felt a
great compassion and empathy

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
for everybody and what
they are going through.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
we never-- we didn't

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:90%
know what tomorrow brings.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know
whether or not we are

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:84%
going to still live
because the planes were

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:90%
flying over our heads.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
We're waking up every
single night for two months

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and just praying and
hoping that there

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is going to be end of that, just
behind the corner, because war

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.870 align:middle line:90%
never brought good to anybody.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're historically
on a winning or losing side,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really matter because
there is always something lost.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:90%
There's lost lives.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:84%
There are lost houses, roofs
overhead, lost close ones.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And you know, just
those things make

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
you see the life from
a different perspective

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and just allow you to kind of
stand still and and rethink

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:84%
about how you perceive
life, how you approach life.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that kind of
childhood, at that time,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:84%
was obviously not
the common one that

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
was happening in the world
with my own generation.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
But as I said at
the beginning, when

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I look at it from
this perspective,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I do appreciate it because it
has helped kind of develop me

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
into the person I am today, into
the tennis player I am today.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
It made me hungrier for
achieving goals and dreams

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:90%
that I've had as a young child.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, it
made me more appreciative,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:84%
more humble of the
value of life and what

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:90%
matters the most, really.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Because my family, as
many, many other families

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.220 align:middle line:84%
throughout Serbia
in those eight, nine

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
years of during '90s, have
fought for a Euro each day.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
So you never knew,
really, whether or not

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have enough
money to feed your family.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those kind
of circumstances

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and situations families had
to face on a daily basis.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So starting from
there, and then--

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and being in such a privileged
and blessed position

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and situation where
I am today allows

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:84%
me to have a bit of
perspective in life.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I would feel
differently today and feel

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.470 align:middle line:84%
like something is
not right, I would

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:84%
try to always go back
and reflect and think

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.160 align:middle line:84%
about what my family has been
through, what my people have

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:84%
been through, and that
makes me, I think,

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
being even more grateful
about what I have today.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.845 align:middle line:90%

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe the universe is
always present everywhere,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:84%
in every single moment
and day of our lives.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.062 align:middle line:84%
So it was the same case
when I was four years old

00:05:45.062 --> 00:05:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and it was a sign of
a destiny, honestly,

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.342 align:middle line:84%
to have three tennis
courts being built just

00:05:49.342 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
in front of the restaurant
that my parents were

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:90%
owning and running.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has ever touched the
tennis racket, prior to me,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:90%
in my family.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So there was no tradition,
no heritage of that sport,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.560 align:middle line:84%
even though my father
was a professional skier

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and my uncle, my
aunt, and so most

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of that part of the family,
they loved being on a mountain

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.680 align:middle line:90%
in the snow.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's where,
actually, my parents met.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:84%
My father was a
skiing instructor

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.050 align:middle line:84%
and my mom wanted
to learn how to ski.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, so he
used that opportunity

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.290 align:middle line:84%
to persuade her
(LAUGHING) into--

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, into a marriage
and having three sons.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a wonderful story.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And myself and my two
younger brothers, we

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:84%
spent a lot of time, whenever we
had from the school in Belgrade

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.260 align:middle line:84%
where we lived,
to be in Kopaonik,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
the mountain where my parents
were running a restaurant.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think it was back
in 1991, You know,

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
there was a field just in
front of the restaurant.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
We were having a restaurant
already for a couple of years,

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and they just decided to make
three tennis courts there.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know, obviously,
I as a four, four

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and a half year-old
child, I'm very curious,

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:90%
as any other child.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I started
going there and asking

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.195 align:middle line:90%
the workers what is going on.

00:07:29.195 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
They explained to
me that they're

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:90%
building a tennis court.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I was bringing drinks for free.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:84%
In return, they
promised me I would

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:84%
participate in the creation
of the tennis courts.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So I had it all,
and I was so blessed

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
to be part of that
experience of creating,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
actually, an actual
tennis court.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And then seeing it
on the TV and then

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:84%
asking my father to buy me a
tennis racquet and everything

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.600 align:middle line:90%
else is a history, after that.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I truly believe
that the universe

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.830 align:middle line:90%
has a big say in our lives.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And I am so grateful that I was
able to play the sport that I

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
truly love, even today, and
that love and flair inside of me

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
has stayed all the
way till today.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So and that's where I extract
the most, I would say,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
joy and happiness
of playing tennis.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And my main motivation
is the very same feeling

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
that was created inside of me
as a spark when I saw tennis

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:84%
on the TV and in
front of my eyes.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate to have
great support of my parents.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we
have to understand

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.873 align:middle line:84%
that tennis is an expensive
sport for any country.

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
For any part of the world, for
that matter, but especially

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
for Serbia at that time
of economic crisis and,

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, just fighting for
survival financially, each day.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And so my parents had to
make a lot of sacrifices

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and they had to really
strongly believe

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
in my talents and abilities
and my willpower to keep going

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and keep playing tennis.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, for the first
several years,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.930 align:middle line:84%
from when I was four
to seven, I was mostly

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
involved in Teddy Tennis-- you
know, school tennis with kids--

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and just playing
around the court

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.472 align:middle line:84%
being in the big
groups of children,

00:09:50.472 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
being part of the
tennis camps that

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
were coming to that mountain
where we spent a lot of time,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and then going back to
Belgrade where we lived in.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
A couple times a week, I
would go for tennis lessons.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I never thought of
it, those early beginnings,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.930 align:middle line:84%
as training as a commitment
or something I have to do,

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:90%
my job, or work.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:90%
It was play.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:90%
It was a game.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:84%
It was fun, and I was
so joyful every time

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
I would step onto the court and
hold the racket because I truly

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:90%
fell in love with the sport.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
love, you know, it

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:84%
led me to spend as much time as
possible on the tennis court.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
seven, I think that's

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:47.430 align:middle line:84%
the first time that I really
had that clear vision of what

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to achieve and who
I wanted to become in tennis.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's mostly
because the base of who

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I am as a tennis player
and the foundations

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:84%
of, my perception
of the tennis world

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:84%
came from a very passionate
and knowledgeable person,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Jelena Gencic, who was a
big influence in my life,

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.500 align:middle line:84%
next to my parents, the
biggest at that time.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, she has
passed away, several years ago,

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
but she was so
devoted to the sport.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
She was a one national
team handball goalkeeper.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:90%
She went to Olympic Games.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:84%
She was playing for a
Fed Cup of Yugoslavia.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:90%
She was a coach of Fed Cup.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:90%
She was coach of Monica Seles.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:84%
She was traveling
with Goran Ivanisevic,

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:84%
so she had a very rich history,
and not just in tennis,

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:90%
but sports overall.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
She was very respected and
appreciated in society of sport

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
in ex-Yugoslavian region, so I
was so fortunate to meet her.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And she has recognized
the potential

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
that I have and shared
that with my parents.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And even though such
a credible person

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
has shared that information
with my parents,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I was still only
six, seven years old.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it was
really hard for my parents

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.715 align:middle line:84%
to evaluate the situation
and say whether or not

00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
step in and really

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.600 align:middle line:90%
support him in this intention.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Because I, even
though I was seven,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I wanted to become
number one and win Wimbledon.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And I had such a clear
vision in my mind,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I was even creating this
Wimbledon trophy out

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
of some plastic materials
and then just a little paper

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and just trying to create
visions and images in my mind

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and create something that
would serve as a motivation

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and inspiration for my life.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:01.686 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.686 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was
actually a situation

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:84%
that was caused by many
other events prior to that.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've
experienced-- prior to 2010,

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.333 align:middle line:84%
Australian Open match
that you're referring to--

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:90%
many struggles on the court.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Respiratory problems, inability
to cope with the heat, just

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:90%
endurance issues.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.625 align:middle line:84%
Even though I was
training hard, I was--

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, had, at
that time, the best

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
team that I could have for
myself with the fitness coach,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:84%
physiotherapist,
doctors, tennis coaches.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I had a complete
team fully devoted

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:50.620 align:middle line:84%
to my high performance kind
of state of the body and mind.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:57.090 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I obviously
didn't understand

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
that there is this nutrition
part that was blocking me,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
in a way, because I wasn't
eating correctly, even

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:90%
though I thought that I was.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up, you
know, with my mom really

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:84%
being cautious of how I
eat and how I think of food

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and how I perceived food as
a fuel to make to my life

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:90%
and to my body.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But you know, coming
from the culture where

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
we are based a lot on the
gluten, which is in the wheat,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and we have bakeries
on each corner,

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
so I had breads and different
bread baskets each day.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:48.808 align:middle line:84%
Basically, even
with eating pizza,

00:14:48.808 --> 00:14:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and I will have a little
bread on the side.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
That's how integrated that
kind of culture of eating

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:90%
was in our region.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, a lot of meat
and sugar, you know?

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Refined sugar, and I only
knew about that kind of sugar.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that
that would cause--

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
all of these things
would cause--

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
that kind of feeling of
being helpless on the court

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and feeling of being
powerless, honestly.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So back in 2010 and playing
against Tsonga in Quarterfinals

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
of the Australian Open,
I was two sets to one up.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big challenge
playing against Jo,

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and we played a few
years before that

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
in the Finals of
Australian Open.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was enjoying
that match, but I

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
was feeling that I'm losing
that kind of fuel in my tank.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.040 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, he was
just feeling stronger

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and I was feeling weaker.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of the sudden,
the vision became different.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see the court
as wide as it was

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the match.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I
had blurred vision.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't catch breath after
each point was finished.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And in no time, he was
a winner of the match.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that between
fourth and fifth set,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I went out to throw up and
felt my stomach was aching.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I felt my energy was so low, and
I was just, my nose was blocked

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and there was plenty
of things going on.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And that was not the first time.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So then I had to
sit down, rethink

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
what is going on
because I didn't want

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:90%
to go through that once again.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Because if I wanted
to achieve my goals

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and to be the best in the
world and to win Grand Slams,

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I had to win against
the best players

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:84%
in the world like
like Tsonga was

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:84%
at that time, or a Federer or
Nadal even on a higher level.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So I had to be ready
to play best of five,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:90%
you know, day after day.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.349 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't, and I knew
that and I wanted to change.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I really had that
desire and willingness

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
to tackle the issues that I've
had, but I didn't know how

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and didn't have access
to the right information.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the right experts
and knowledgeable people

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.930 align:middle line:90%
I did have some experts.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:84%
They were telling me
things that I already heard

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and I was trying a
different inhalations

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:90%
and different herbs.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I tried, you know, I had even
had a surgery of the nose

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
because I had a
little deviation, just

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to kind of try to open up
the sinuses and channels

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and kind of get
more oxygen flow.

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was much more
simpler than that.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I just needed that
information about the change

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:90%
of the diet and nutrition.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's, finally,
that's something

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
that I received in the second,
the mid part of the 2010

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:18.590 align:middle line:84%
when I met Dr. Igor
Cetojevic, whom I've

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:90%
met through mutual friends.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And he has actually watched
that match in Australian Open

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
earlier that year,
and he felt the need

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
to get in touch with
me and to help me out.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And through his
biofeedback machine,

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.640 align:middle line:84%
a non-invasive therapy,
he received the data that

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm just--

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:90%
I have a very--

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I have a great
sensitivity on gluten.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
No celiac disease,
but great sensitivity,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
intolerance to gluten,
to dairy products,

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and obviously to refined sugar
as everybody in this world.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.153 align:middle line:84%
And so I made that
change and, after that,

00:19:00.153 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:90%
my life was different.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.515 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:03.515 --> 00:19:08.894 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.894 --> 00:19:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I felt completely different
because the information

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
of the food, of whatever in
life could flow much better

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and differently through
my body because I

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:90%
didn't have those blockages.

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I was not feeling,
anymore, clogged up.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I was not feeling that I have
literally stones in my channels

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that were not allowing
information to flow.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And so when that changed,
the whole energy of the body

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.570 align:middle line:90%
has since changed.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
became more conscious.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:90%
I became more aware.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I've had more clarity of mind
and I could comprehend things

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.550 align:middle line:90%
better, now.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden, it's like
my body has received that kind

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:84%
of light and blessing, and
it's-- and the universe was

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
just, from that point on, just
feeding me with all the right

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.010 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And the circumstances in
life that I've had after that

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:90%
were phenomenal.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And I am so, so privileged
to be able to keep

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.450 align:middle line:84%
playing tennis on
that high level,

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:84%
but yet, again, be so conscious
of myself on how I fuel my body

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and how I perceive
things mentally.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And all of that, combined,
was just a thrill.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wish, honestly,
to first of all

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.975 align:middle line:84%
be, myself, the change that
I want to see in the world,

00:20:53.975 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that I want to
see in the people.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very powerful
thinking to change the world,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
but you can't preach
to people because then

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:90%
that's not the right energy.

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not the right
information, right approach

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:84%
because just people will not be
able to understand and receive

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and absorb the information
that you send to them

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:84%
if you're preaching to them,
if you know what I mean.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:30.302 align:middle line:84%
So I understood that,
the last couple of years.

00:21:30.302 --> 00:21:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
that at the beginning

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.985 align:middle line:84%
because I was so excited
with that change in 2010.

00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
years after that,

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I felt so strong as a
tennis player on the court

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:41.995 align:middle line:90%
and I recovered better.

00:21:41.995 --> 00:21:42.870 align:middle line:90%
I had more endurance.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:90%
I had more clarity of mind.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
All of the sudden, all
the horizons of life

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.940 align:middle line:90%
opened up to me.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to share that
with the people around me,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:84%
first of all; my
family, obviously;

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and then the rest of the world.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't done
it in a proper way

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:03.000 align:middle line:84%
because I was so excited that,
because of that excitement,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I kind of intruded, a little
bit, the space and the thinking

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:90%
of the people around me.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a bit of
a while to understand,

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:90%
how am I able to share this?

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.870 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you
know, it's only

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of the evolution.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there is
so much to discover

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:27.648 align:middle line:84%
and there's so much to receive
I just need to be open for it.

00:22:27.648 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But then, second of
all, I would like

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
to share it at the same
time because I see and feel

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.380 align:middle line:90%
the change in my life.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of my
profession, everybody

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.400 align:middle line:90%
wants to be healthy, right?

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to
thrive in well-being.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I have
discovered something,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and being in such a
privileged position

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and having a status of
one of the top athletes,

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I could leverage that position
and in kind of conveying

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%
that kind of message.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So that was the thinking I
had ever since that change.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But up to recently, I was
figuring it out, in what way

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I can leverage that,
I can use that.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And so through the
films and through

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:84%
various different
initiatives and projects

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have in mind, I really
hope to touch people as with it

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:90%
partially, with the first book.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.470 align:middle line:84%
We're creating the
second one as well.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's all
about, first of all,

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
not finding yourself,
but creating

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.480 align:middle line:84%
yourself starting from
that kind of sense

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:84%
of mind and willingness
to learn and willingness

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:84%
to receive the
information, willingness

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to go inside, go inwards,
tap into that inner voice.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Because the self-talk is
the talk with universe.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all have to
be kind of aware of that.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And you know, next
thing you know,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge wave of
consciousness and awareness

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge that
comes your way.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:84%
You're not even
thinking about it,

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.090 align:middle line:84%
but you're receiving
it because you're

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:26.040 align:middle line:84%
kind of tuned into that
eternal source of divine light.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I try to start the day
being really grateful to have

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:84%
another opportunity to live,
and to really sense my body,

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:84%
to breathe in and
out deeply few times,

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and just realize how
blessed I am to be healthy,

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:58.550 align:middle line:84%
to have a family, to be
able to eat great quality

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:03.110 align:middle line:84%
organic living foods, to be able
to play the sport that I love,

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and to have the opportunity
to influence people

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And so it's endless
list of things

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that you can be grateful for,
so that's the first thing.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thought
I start my day with.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, my
day is even better

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:84%
if I have my wife in my
bed next to me, which

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.960 align:middle line:84%
is not the case all
the time because

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of my work.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But after that, it's all about,
generally speaking, fueling

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.460 align:middle line:84%
your body with the
right nutrients.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think it's
important for everybody

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:84%
to discover what it
is that they should

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:84%
fuel their body with so
they can get rid of toxins--

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:84%
physical toxins, mental
toxins, emotional toxins,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:90%
spiritual toxins.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest and
maybe most simplest

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:84%
way to start with getting rid
of all the emotional luggage

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.300 align:middle line:84%
that you carry and all
these blockages and toxins

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:90%
is to start eating correctly.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And any kind of form
of living food--

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, vegetables,
fruits, grains, seeds, nuts,

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:26.550 align:middle line:84%
cold-pressed oils, you know,
anything of that is plant-based

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:90%
and that is organic--

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is just, it's an energy,
pure energy to your body.

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And I try to start with that.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I have
cold-pressed juices.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I love the green
juices in the morning.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I get a little detox
because, up to 12 o'clock,

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:51.170 align:middle line:84%
around noon, it's usually
your bio-clock for detox,

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:57.050 align:middle line:84%
and I try to get those
liquids in as much as I can.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:02.110 align:middle line:84%
I get some of the acai
bowls or a matcha bowl

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:90%
or superfood smoothies.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, just not getting
as much as I can, but I

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
do make a break
in-between and generally

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.750 align:middle line:84%
just trying to nurture
my body and cherish

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:84%
the fact that I have
this awareness about it

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and what it does to me.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
everybody's different,

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.720 align:middle line:84%
but one thing is for
sure, the living foods,

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
the organic foods,
non-processed foods

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
are the best thing that you
can fuel your body with.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:42.810 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, we talk about toxins,
right, getting rid of toxins.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And stress is probably the
biggest toxin that we have,

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:56.880 align:middle line:84%
today, and biggest
opposer to our health

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:90%
and to our prosperity.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, again, you
should start with getting rid

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.780 align:middle line:84%
of toxins, in order
to thrive and not

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:84%
just survive in our type of
understanding and approach

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.710 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like there's
this majority of people,

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:84%
today, they are just
eating to survive,

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
just eating to
fill their stomach,

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and just move on with
whatever day they were doing.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.230 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, I think
it's important to have

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
that conscience and information
of how the food that you get

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.770 align:middle line:84%
as a fuel in your body
affects everything,

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.050 align:middle line:84%
you know, affects your energy
levels, affects your health,

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:90%
your well-being.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end of the
day, when you become a father

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:84%
as I was so blessed to
do a couple of years ago,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:90%
your life changes.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Your priority changes
and, all of the sudden,

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:90%
everything you do is--

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.290 align:middle line:84%
has meaning, has sense,
because you're doing it

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
for a little creature
that is growing up

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:84%
that is waiting for
your love and compassion

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.160 align:middle line:90%
and directions in life.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And they are such
little masters.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We can learn so much from them,
to be in the present moment,

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.580 align:middle line:84%
to move from one moment to
another without feeling guilt

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and without carrying
that luggage behind.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And they, you know, every day
is amazing to see the evolution

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and development of children.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And you realize, at that point,
that it's not about yourself

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
It's about your family, about
your wife and your child,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:47.310 align:middle line:84%
but that can be a bit
tricky for your mind.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Because then you
would think, well, I'm

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.500 align:middle line:84%
not so important anymore
to be unto myself.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's all about them
being healthy, being well-fed,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:90%
being happy, joyful.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, many
people would just kind of

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:84%
jeopardize their own health,
sacrifice their own routines

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and of eating good, just
exercising, surrounding

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.540 align:middle line:84%
yourself with positivity
and right thinking,

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:27.690 align:middle line:84%
and dedicating the time to your
self-work and evolution because

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
of the noble thought,
which is the noble thought

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:90%
to take care of your family.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But what good are you for
them if you are not healthy,

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have that
wellness, right, in every aspect

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.200 align:middle line:90%
of your being and your life?

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:90%
So I think that the best way--

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I think, that's the right
example is in the family--

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:84%
best way for you to
evoke and kind of trigger

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:84%
the change in people around you
is through to work on yourself

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.198 align:middle line:84%
and to be the example,
to be that change

00:31:01.198 --> 00:31:02.490 align:middle line:90%
that you want to see in others.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that kind of mindset
should be present in people

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.345 align:middle line:90%
because it's--

00:31:08.345 --> 00:31:11.790 align:middle line:84%
in the end of the day, as I
said, everybody's, different.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:17.310 align:middle line:84%
My diet is based 90%
on plant-based diet.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And I have, occasionally,
fish, and that's all

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.120 align:middle line:90%
from the animal-based foods.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have made that decision
because of the passion

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:33.690 align:middle line:84%
towards the food and the
willingness to discover more,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.800 align:middle line:90%
to learn more.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.735 align:middle line:84%
And I found it the most
thriving for my body,

00:31:38.735 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that it's the same for every
single one on this planet.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think each one
should get curious,

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.810 align:middle line:84%
as every single child on
this planet is curious.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Just understand that
the fuel for your body

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:59.460 align:middle line:84%
is is the strength,
is the energy

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:90%
that carries you in the life.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's same with a car.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:84%
You go to the gas station,
and if you put a wrong fuel

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:84%
in your car, your car might
go for a certain time,

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.570 align:middle line:84%
but the engine will be
broken, the car will not

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
go after a certain
time, will not function.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Same with your metabolism.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Your body is structured in such
a complex and intelligent way,

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:84%
you know, from divine
energy in universe

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that it's smart enough to
heal itself, to run itself,

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:84%
If you are feeding it
with the right information

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.937 align:middle line:84%
through food, through your
surrounding, through whatever

00:32:38.937 --> 00:32:39.770 align:middle line:90%
you do in your life.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.596 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:42.596 --> 00:32:47.510 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:49.685 align:middle line:84%
Well, she gave me
the foundations

00:32:49.685 --> 00:32:57.980 align:middle line:84%
of who I am, self-belief, the
courageous, I'd say, approach

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.800 align:middle line:90%
to the tennis world, to dreams.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
As every child, I
was very curious

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was very much in love
with what I did and I just

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:90%
wanted to play.

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I am so grateful
to my parents

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.030 align:middle line:84%
that they had faith
in Jelena Gencic

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and they allowed her
to be the influence

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.460 align:middle line:90%
that she was in my life.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, people
keep forgetting that,

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's such an important
factor where parents really

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.800 align:middle line:84%
have enough trust in a person
that is not part of the family

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:84%
to be able to influence
you like that person

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.680 align:middle line:90%
is part of the family.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So that was the case,
and I spent a lot of time

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:46.160 align:middle line:84%
at home, her house,
and listening

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.770 align:middle line:84%
to the classical music
and having visualizations

00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and observing the different
video materials of the both man

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and woman champions at
that time, you know,

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.530 align:middle line:84%
picking up the right things,
talking about tennis,

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
technical stuff,

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and just talking about
life, in general.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the combination
between her and my parents

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.690 align:middle line:84%
was a formula of success
for me because they have--

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I have inherited that kind of
mental strength and an ability

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:34.429 align:middle line:84%
to really believe
in myself and trust

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:36.739 align:middle line:90%
in my instincts, my intuition.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And even though
that I have grown up

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.560 align:middle line:84%
in such circumstances
that would appear

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:49.320 align:middle line:84%
a bit unrealistic for a young
tennis player to succeed

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and into professional
waters and eventually

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.699 align:middle line:84%
become number one in
the world, you know,

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:90%
I still was very fortunate.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I need to thank the
universe for that,

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.950 align:middle line:84%
for allowing me to be surrounded
with the right people,

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, with the
right heart and passion.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And they all cared about me and
they cared about my growing up.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
holistic approach

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:23.930 align:middle line:84%
that I have today towards the
tennis and life in general

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:32.240 align:middle line:84%
has started with Jelena Gencic
and because she was not just

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:90%
a tennis coach.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I still didn't meet
too many people that

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:39.670 align:middle line:84%
would listen to classical music
in between of training sessions

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and poetry and talk about life
and learn different languages.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to
make me, together

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:84%
with my parents, a
complete person, somebody

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.200 align:middle line:84%
that is able to master
himself, first, and then

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.820 align:middle line:90%
and then others, after that.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very grateful
to have her in my life.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.635 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:03.635 --> 00:36:09.311 align:middle line:90%


00:36:09.311 --> 00:36:13.095 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it has been an
essential tool in my life

00:36:13.095 --> 00:36:14.970 align:middle line:84%
on the tennis court and
off the tennis court.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so devoted, right
now, at this stage of my life,

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.660 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual growth much
more than material growth.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I believe that material
growth comes as a consequence

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.400 align:middle line:84%
to your spiritual growth, your
human growth, your character

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:90%
growth.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So I have been really trying
each day to take some time

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and be mindful of who I
am, you know, meditate,

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.630 align:middle line:84%
go through breathing
exercises, or just sit there

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:84%
with eyes closed or with
eyes open and observe nature

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:58.260 align:middle line:84%
and try to inhale that
power of nature and power

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.330 align:middle line:90%
of divine light.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Because essentially,
we are all life.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:07.020 align:middle line:90%
We all come from that source.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I really
cannot, right now,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.740 align:middle line:90%
imagine myself without that.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And know, you can
always correct yourself.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We go back to that
subject of talking

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:84%
about how complex and
intelligent the body is

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:90%
and how quickly it can reset.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And if we allow it to
reset, if we close our eyes

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and be in the present moment
and observe the thoughts--

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.540 align:middle line:84%
not influence them, not control
them, but observe them--

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:84%
we are allowing our body to be
filled with the divine light,

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.360 align:middle line:84%
to be connected with the
universe, to calm our thoughts,

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and finally to reset,
regroup, correct.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Because we are all people,
and with the society

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.900 align:middle line:84%
that we live in and with
the world that surrounds us,

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.220 align:middle line:84%
this is normal
that each day we go

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:11.470 align:middle line:84%
through certain positive
and negative vibrations

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:90%
and influences.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And it all has its impact
on our mind, body, and soul.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why it's
important to approach life

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:84%
from that holistic
overview and understand

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that each aspect of your
being needs some caring.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.690 align:middle line:90%
You need some nurturing.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And mindfulness
is something that

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:45.580 align:middle line:84%
has helped me to regain
my emotional stability,

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.670 align:middle line:84%
my mental strength in the
toughest moments on the court

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:53.590 align:middle line:84%
with just closing the eyes
and inhaling two, three

00:38:53.590 --> 00:39:00.910 align:middle line:84%
times and just, first of all,
being present, being conscious

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:06.100 align:middle line:84%
about the possibility to
play the tennis, again,

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.770 align:middle line:84%
to be at that level, because
sometimes we do take it

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.810 align:middle line:90%
for granted.

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the fact that
I'm there for a reason

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm open to
whatever circumstances that

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:90%
are coming my way.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So I, you know, we've been
trained a little bit by society

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.530 align:middle line:84%
to think too much in advance,
too much in the future

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:35.410 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for what's coming
up and to be kind of linked too

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.350 align:middle line:90%
much and connected to the past.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Where I think that the past
is something that has already

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.760 align:middle line:84%
happened-- we can't
influence it--

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and we should learn
from it and move on.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And future is not
in our hands, and we

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.850 align:middle line:84%
should try not to expect,
but be grateful for whatever

00:39:54.850 --> 00:40:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is coming our way and thrive
and strive to be in the moment.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.497 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
children can teach us so much,

00:40:03.497 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:90%
and that's why they are masters.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.275 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:07.275 --> 00:40:12.660 align:middle line:90%


00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it started from the very
early days of my tennis life

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.440 align:middle line:84%
and tennis career,
where I was taught

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
to stretch and to
take care of my body

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:84%
because then I'm going to have
the longevity and an enduring

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.130 align:middle line:90%
career.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I moved on
into life, I did

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.310 align:middle line:84%
go through several
tough injuries,

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:84%
as every athlete goes
through, that have

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.520 align:middle line:84%
made you wonder whether you're
doing things the right way

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.320 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Because each injury has some
kind of message behind that

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:84%
you need to kind of unlock
and discover what it is.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the last big injury
I've had was back in 2011.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I've had an amazing season and
I've played a lot of matches,

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:22.010 align:middle line:84%
but I got carried away and
maybe played too much, chased

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:84%
too much, and I got that
karmic slap in my face.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And I had an injury
that took me off

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:84%
from the tour for
about two months,

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.070 align:middle line:90%
and I started rethinking.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
I strongly believe

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to reach another
climax in your life,

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:90%
you need to have a little drop.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And those kind of, if you
want to call them failures--

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:84%
which I don't consider
failures, I just consider them

00:41:54.410 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:84%
as a result of what you do
and who you are in life--

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.640 align:middle line:90%
can teach us something.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can move on from
that as a stronger person

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and as a Phoenix rises
and even more capable.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Or you can let that
weight on your shoulder

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.310 align:middle line:90%
take you even further down.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So I have fortunately
have been, again,

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:25.250 align:middle line:84%
surrounded with the people that
have been very encouraging.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
They have been very thoughtful,
and have lifted me up

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.910 align:middle line:90%
when I needed that the most.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Because finally, you know,
you're not alone in this world,

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:41.480 align:middle line:84%
and there are things that
you cannot always handle

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.500 align:middle line:90%
by yourself.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Surely, it all
starts and ends here,

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and you need to do your
work, that work, yourself.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But yet again, you need that
kind of positive assessment

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:90%
from outside.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.450 align:middle line:84%
You need that help,
that guidance,

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.500 align:middle line:84%
in a way, to help you
battle that inner battles

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:84%
in a right way, the
ego and the fears

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and the doubts that
I've been through a lot

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:18.050 align:middle line:84%
and that, again, have
happened for a reason.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:21.980 align:middle line:84%
They needed to be there through
the course of my life in order

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.700 align:middle line:84%
for me to reach the
climax that I have.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's a constant
learning curve.

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:33.042 align:middle line:84%
It's a constant evolution
and progress forward.

00:43:33.042 --> 00:43:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it's a regression.

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:35.950 align:middle line:90%
There is no stagnation.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, everything in
life is moving forward,

00:43:38.130 --> 00:43:40.700 align:middle line:84%
so I always have that
in back of my mind.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And the yoga, the stretching,
the new informations through

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:53.590 align:middle line:84%
exercises, through
mindfulness, through

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.850 align:middle line:84%
spiritual
enlightenment, whatever

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I receive today and the
next days, I'm open for it

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and I know that it's there for
a reason for me to get better,

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:07.670 align:middle line:84%
to progress, and evolve
my soul in this life.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Because finally,
you know, our souls

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.820 align:middle line:84%
have been through so
many lives and this is--

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:90%
it's neverending.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And once again, talking
about the soul life,

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:23.120 align:middle line:84%
once I've reached that
kind of discovery,

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.760 align:middle line:90%
it was something huge.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, we're not
taught by the society

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.210 align:middle line:90%
that there are other lives.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:35.660 align:middle line:84%
You know it's the life that you
have right now, you're born,

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:90%
you die, and that's it.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:37.880 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:43.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have a soul that
has descended into your body

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and has given you the
opportunities, given

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:51.200 align:middle line:84%
opportunity to your parents,
to have the material form

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and to live in
this material life.

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So try to use it in
the best way possible

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:00.590 align:middle line:84%
so you can improve
yourself, improve your soul,

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:90%
and evolve for the next life.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And I maybe went too far,
because your question was

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.850 align:middle line:84%
about yoga and
stretching, but I just

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:17.900 align:middle line:84%
felt that I had to share this
because it's much, I would say,

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:21.760 align:middle line:84%
more complex and
it reaches further,

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I would say, horizons than just
doing a stretch on a hamstring,

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.410 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I mean.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:84%
By doing that, you should be
able to tune into your body

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and breathe through it and
have a little more stretch.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But be conscious of
that moment, you know,

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.430 align:middle line:84%
not typing in the
phones and stuff.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And those are things that
I'm still learning myself

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:50.060 align:middle line:84%
because there are moments
when I'm completely,

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.460 align:middle line:84%
as I should be, you
know, when I'm stretching

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.200 align:middle line:90%
or when I'm eating.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm there.

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm sending my
energy to the food.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm sending my energy
to yoga exercises,

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and receiving the
energy back because I'm

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.710 align:middle line:84%
one with the nature,
I'm one with myself

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.690 align:middle line:90%
and with the divine source.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.340 align:middle line:84%
But there are moments when
I tend to forget that,

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's a
process of evolution for me

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:17.665 align:middle line:90%
and everybody else.

00:46:17.665 --> 00:46:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And if I may share the one
more thing that is, you know,

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.680 align:middle line:84%
probably the biggest, one
of the biggest informations

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:35.050 align:middle line:84%
that I got lately is the fact
that inner work, self work,

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:38.550 align:middle line:84%
is the biggest work that
you can have in your life.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:41.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, we think
that building a biceps

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.660 align:middle line:84%
in the gym over the course
of, whatever, a couple weeks

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.240 align:middle line:84%
or months or I don't know,
getting yourself ready

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.390 align:middle line:84%
for an Ironman competition is
the biggest work we can do,

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.770 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.600 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's that inner work.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:47:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It's that courage and ability
to fight with your own fears,

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to handle your own
thoughts, and to understand

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that you can't control
things in life, that you

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:16.150 align:middle line:84%
can be in harmony with yourself
only if you're working on

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.950 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:21.000 align:middle line:84%
If you go inside, if you
are mindful, you meditate,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.110 align:middle line:84%
you try to surround
yourself with

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:26.450 align:middle line:84%
the right positive
environment, people

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:30.690 align:middle line:84%
that raise your vibrations,
raise your frequency.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's also exciting
because, every day,

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.870 align:middle line:84%
there is something to work
on, if you know I mean.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.783 align:middle line:84%
Not in a material way, but
in a spiritual, human way.

00:47:39.783 --> 00:47:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And material in a
spiritual way combined

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:47.445 align:middle line:90%
is the evolution like not other.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:50.355 --> 00:47:55.210 align:middle line:90%


00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:59.410 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I'm so
privileged to be successful

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and to have this status of
top athlete and influence.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that on there,
you know, is due to the help

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that I had from so many people,
I haven't done it alone.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And having that always
in the back of my mind

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:31.750 align:middle line:84%
helps me understand that there
is such a vast world of people

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that, unfortunately,
with all their talents

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and dreams and
aspirations are not

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:44.980 align:middle line:84%
able to succeed
because they don't have

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:48.100 align:middle line:84%
either the conditions
or support or access

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:54.670 align:middle line:84%
to education, to
most basic needs.

00:48:54.670 --> 00:49:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And that is why, back in 2007,
with my parents and my family,

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:04.420 align:middle line:84%
we have founded the Novak
Djokovic Foundation.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And until 2011, we have
helped in many different ways

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.990 align:middle line:90%
to people in need.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:18.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's people with
medical conditions to education

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:20.510 align:middle line:90%
through different programs.

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:26.110 align:middle line:84%
But back into 2011, we
my wife also joined in

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:30.010 align:middle line:84%
and we have decided that we
need a purpose of foundation.

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:90%
We need that direction.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.350 align:middle line:90%
We need a mission.

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And we need to be able
to devote to one goal,

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and that was education,
pre-school education,

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.410 align:middle line:90%
to be precise, in Serbia.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Because unfortunately, over
50% of children in Serbia

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:55.510 align:middle line:84%
are not attending any preschool,
programs or institutions,

00:49:55.510 --> 00:50:03.250 align:middle line:84%
some due to financial
issues and some

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to the cultural comprehension
of what those kindergartens

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and preschool institutions
and programs represent.

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're really,
as a team, trying

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to spread the awareness
about importance of education

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:25.330 align:middle line:84%
as a foundation of growth
because, finally, education

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.790 align:middle line:84%
is something that nobody can
really take away from you.

00:50:27.790 --> 00:50:30.250 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you
have, that you possess,

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:34.060 align:middle line:90%
that you have earned.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And to see people,
to see children smile

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and to see them so
joyful and happy

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.330 align:middle line:84%
in their schools
and kindergartens

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:53.990 align:middle line:84%
and their playgrounds is
something that you can't pay.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.837 align:middle line:90%
There is no value.

00:50:54.837 --> 00:50:55.920 align:middle line:90%
There is no price to that.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It just fills your heart
with joy, with light,

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:01.070 align:middle line:90%
with everything.

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, we all talk
about leaving a better world

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:07.730 align:middle line:84%
for our children, and the
world is left on our children,

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:12.390 align:middle line:84%
but let's also create
that kind of world that--

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:15.590 align:middle line:84%
where they are able to thrive
and not survive, you know?

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful
to all the team

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:23.560 align:middle line:84%
from foundation on
their contribution

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.230 align:middle line:90%
and the work they do.

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We have a fantastic
team of people.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But we are still a
young foundation.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:33.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, it takes
a long time for us

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to really establish big global
institutions which, hopefully,

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040 align:middle line:90%
one day we'll do.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.030 align:middle line:84%
But right now, we're focused
on Serbia, naturally,

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.150 align:middle line:84%
because my wife and I, my
family come from Serbia,

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and we see so many
different issues

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that need some resolving,
that need some help.

00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And through the
foundation, I try

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:08.700 align:middle line:84%
to give back as much as I can
as a successful professional

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:14.220 align:middle line:84%
athlete, but also through
many other ways personally

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.590 align:middle line:90%
that it's part of my life.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:18.779 align:middle line:90%
It's part of who I am.

00:52:18.779 --> 00:52:21.224 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:52:21.224 --> 00:52:26.610 align:middle line:90%


00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Amor y Paz, it's love and peace.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's so simple,
but yet so powerful.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:37.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a philosophy of
life, but it's also

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:42.580 align:middle line:84%
a program, a group that
my brother is part of.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:44.930 align:middle line:84%
My brother lives
in Marbella, Spain,

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.230 align:middle line:84%
where we are at the
moment and where

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:51.350 align:middle line:84%
we tend to come to visit
him as much as we can.

00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And he's collaborating
and working

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:59.540 align:middle line:84%
in this group with his former
coach and his life coach

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Pepe Imaz, who is a creator and
a founder of that Amor y Paz

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:10.850 align:middle line:84%
group that essentially
shares love,

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:14.750 align:middle line:84%
shares love in every
aspect of their being,

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:18.420 align:middle line:84%
in every way possible
that they can.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And whether you
are playing tennis

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:24.870 align:middle line:84%
or you're doing sports or
whatever, whoever you are,

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:32.600 align:middle line:84%
you're welcome as the common
human being filled with love.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's how they treat you.

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And finally, it's treating
everybody the same.

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:46.730 align:middle line:84%
We are all kids of divine
light and that's what I feel

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:50.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's what you feel
when you're part of that Love

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and Peace in motion, that
group of people that prays

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.180 align:middle line:84%
for your soul to thrive,
prays for your soul

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.090 align:middle line:90%
to have love and have light.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening more.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I feel like there
is consciousness

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:09.680 align:middle line:84%
in the world, globally,
that is changing

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:14.240 align:middle line:84%
that is looking towards
finding that love,

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.900 align:middle line:84%
finding that connection with
yourself, with other people.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know, today,
with everything

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:24.950 align:middle line:84%
that is happening in this
world, the horrific things,

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.860 align:middle line:84%
there is a part of the
world and maybe society

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:32.150 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to divide
nations, divide people.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:34.604 align:middle line:84%
But you know,
essentially, there is

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:41.180 align:middle line:84%
this global overall
profound energy that

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.570 align:middle line:90%
connects us all together.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So as much as we, as people,
try to divide ourselves

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:53.060 align:middle line:84%
into religions, cultures,
colors of the skin

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:58.100 align:middle line:84%
or face or whatever, differences
that you can come up with,

00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.930 align:middle line:90%
we are drawn together.

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
philosophy of Amor y Paz is,

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and the Love and Peace because
we all want peace in the world,

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:09.530 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many
different kind of obstacles

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:18.325 align:middle line:84%
and influences and dark energies
that are surrounding us,

00:55:18.325 --> 00:55:21.692 align:middle line:84%
that are waiting for
every possible chance

00:55:21.692 --> 00:55:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and opportunity,
while we are weak,

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:27.120 align:middle line:84%
to tackle and to take
over control of us.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And then our ego surfaces,
and then we feel powerful.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:37.550 align:middle line:84%
We feel like we own the
people, we own the planet,

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:39.080 align:middle line:90%
we own nature.

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the worst
things happen, right?

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.480 align:middle line:84%
We're doing a lot
of harm to animals,

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to planet, nature,
to other people.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.310 align:middle line:90%
We're Destroying things.

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And we were created to
build, to construct,

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:57.170 align:middle line:84%
to evolve, to thrive,
to love, because that's

00:55:57.170 --> 00:56:01.400 align:middle line:84%
the essence of who we are
and that's what's fueling us

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and that's what is our
mission on this planet.

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And the other day,
I was meditating

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.000 align:middle line:90%
with Pepe and my brother.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.114 align:middle line:84%
And Pepe was talking
about, you know,

00:56:17.114 --> 00:56:20.510 align:middle line:84%
the essence of our existence
here, of our presence,

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and who we are
and the evolution.

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And we had a wonderful
moment together

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.230 align:middle line:84%
where you could feel that
our energies connected.

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's when it came
to me that in a simple,

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:40.660 align:middle line:84%
let's say, translation
into words and thoughts.

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:47.420 align:middle line:84%
It can be perceived
as making it--

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:51.140 align:middle line:84%
or make it, live it,
and share it, right?

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Because the first
part of your life,

00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:58.820 align:middle line:84%
you tend to create yourself,
not find yourself, create.

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, you were
curious as a child.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.710 align:middle line:90%
You have different aspirations.

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:04.910 align:middle line:90%
You have a different dreams.

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:07.190 align:middle line:84%
You want to try
everything in life,

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.680 align:middle line:84%
until you finally
figure out what it is

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.540 align:middle line:90%
and you make something, right?

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.520 align:middle line:90%
And then you live it.

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:19.160 align:middle line:84%
You try to find that
courage and that boldness

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:27.640 align:middle line:84%
to really be bold enough to live
that and to serve as an example

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.810 align:middle line:90%
to everybody else.

00:57:28.810 --> 00:57:31.210 align:middle line:90%
And then, in the end, share it.

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Because that final
stage of, let's say,

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:38.290 align:middle line:84%
evolution is really sharing
it with everybody else.

00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not going
to take your energy,

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.830 align:middle line:84%
your feelings, your
knowledge, your information,

00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:51.130 align:middle line:84%
everything that you have learned
or received or comprehended

00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:56.020 align:middle line:84%
throughout your life with you,
in your body, in your grave.

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're not going
to take that with you.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need to
share it because that's

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:05.080 align:middle line:84%
the whole point of our existence
with each other, you know?

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Because we are drawn
to each other and we

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:14.890 align:middle line:84%
need to be able to
kind of correlate

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and collaborate and share
the information and thoughts

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and emotions in order to
ascend as spiritual beings.

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's was something
that, you know,

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:32.300 align:middle line:84%
fills my heart whenever I think
about it, whenever I live it,

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.100 align:middle line:90%
whenever I share.

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:35.850 align:middle line:90%
