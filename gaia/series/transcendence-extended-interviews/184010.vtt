[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:13.664 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> A catalyst-- yeah, I think
it has got to do with my birth

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and the trauma because they
never expected me to come one

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of a twin, and I stayed
too long in the womb,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't know that
somebody was in there.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So just far too
long I stayed in,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and I almost suffocated
and was born in a hallway,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:90%
in the cold hallway.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So that makes an
imprint, psychic imprint,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.470 align:middle line:84%
on the baby who has no reference
of consciousness of what

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:90%
is happening, just surviving.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So it always haunted
me within, looking--

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:90%
what is happening?

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:90%
There's something I don't know.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And when I became
an adolescent, I

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
began to get much more
into esoteric disciplines

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
and look in practices,
philosophies,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
as cultural different
areas because I couldn't

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:84%
find the match which was going
on in the depth of my psyche.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I found the
water, the cold water.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And the water, cold
water, is direct.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
It brought me right
in there in that area

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
where trauma is
chemically stored,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:90%
and it made me feel just good.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
For the first time,
I knew, this is it.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And from there, because wherever
you feel good, you go back.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And it made me feel
good every time.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to become
aware that breathing

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
makes a big difference when
you are, say, in ice water.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:84%
That means a great impact on
the nervous system, the vascular

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.080 align:middle line:90%
system, on the body in general.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And it made me become aware
that if I was breathing more

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
profound, I was able
to stay much longer

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:90%
in that cold environment.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of months
later, because I felt so good

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and began to explore
just by feeling

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I can do more
profound breathing,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I was able just to do,
with 25 deep breaths,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to stay five to seven
minutes under the ice

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and fully controlled.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Later I began to
think about this.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And I did it every
day, very secluded,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:84%
not showing anybody because I
think people think it's crazy

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:90%
what this man is doing--

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
like, five, seven
minutes under the ice,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and he's swimming there and
staying in his pants barefoot

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.520 align:middle line:84%
through the snow and
all those things.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I just kept very secretive
within my own discipline

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:90%
and mind.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It made me able to
go under the ice,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:84%
stay there, find tranquility,
deep tranquility.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Later I began to get this
breathing going in the home.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So the cold made me
learn to tap in deeper

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:84%
by deeper breathing--
very controlled.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I did it at home
separate from the cold,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:84%
and I saw all these lights, all,
again, sort of the sensations.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Deep sensations began to happen.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And it made me able to do
challenges beyond belief.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I could explore--
suddenly I could

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
stay a whole night
sitting outside

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:84%
in freezing
temperatures in shorts

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
just sitting, having
control there over.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
That means a physiological
control by the mind,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
by your will, and
that ultimately

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
led to challenging my body in
the mountains, under the ice,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
hanging by one finger, running
marathons without training,

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
because I knew how to
tap into the deeper

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:90%
physiology, the power within.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And it is within everybody.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:90%
I knew that.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I talked about it.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
But nobody was
able to understand

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:90%
for real what I was doing.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
On television, I talked about
it, and they said, he's crazy.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
He's stating things
that is not possible.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
He's crazy-- and a lot of
mockery, a lot of cynicism

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:90%
that was going on.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
But it led, anyway, to
television performances.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:90%
You know television.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Television wants I
get you to do this.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Can you do more?

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Can you do more?

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.876 align:middle line:90%
Can you do more, more, more?

00:05:03.876 --> 00:05:05.292 align:middle line:90%
Bam!

00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:07.090 align:middle line:90%
Climb Mount Everest.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Swim 100 meters under the ice.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Go run beyond the polar circle
in shorts, then in the desert.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Hang by one finger 1/2
kilometer in the sky.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Can you do this?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Can you do this?

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:90%
I say, I can do this.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists began
to become interested.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:90%
They saw this on television.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Hey, what this man is
doing is not possible.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:90%
It's what we see in science.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
They say, human
physiology is not

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:90%
capable of doing these things.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
They began to test, to
invite me to test me

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
in thermophysiological
experiments,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and they saw incredible things,
data they never saw before,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
a man being there, like,
two hours in the ice and not

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
decreasing his core
body temperature.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:84%
That's normally autonomically
arranged in the body.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
That's outside of our will,
the autonomic nervous system,

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and that's not
possible to stay, say,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
two hours with no core
body temperature decrease.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And they took blood
while I was in there,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and they exposed
bacteria in lab setting,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and they saw zero
reaction, zero inflammation

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:90%
on the immune cells.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
This could be an enormous
discovery of the immune system

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.310 align:middle line:90%
at will working for people.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:90%
But he is the Iceman.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he can do it.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, no,
it's not about me.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:84%
It's about human
physiology, the depth

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
we have lost because
of our comfort zone

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
behavior, this
cultural thing, and we

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:90%
think we can control nature.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But we cannot
control our disease,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.930 align:middle line:90%
depression in many ways.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And we got all hospital,
psychiatrist, asylums,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and all that,
institutions for that.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
We think that is normal.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I think the depth of the
human physiology preventing

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
from people to become depressed
or sick, that is there.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So I told them, no,
it's not about me.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:90%
It's about everybody.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do this.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
It is just learning how to
expose gradually back to work

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:90%
this depth of the physiology.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Expose it.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:90%
And no force involved.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
It just shows that the
immune system and endocrine

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.030 align:middle line:84%
systems, the autonomic
nervous system,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
can be tapped in to be able to
make the immune system at will

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:90%
working for anybody.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:90%
So they tested me.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
They tested me in the
immune system experiment.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
They injected me with
E. coli bacteria.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And normally you get sick
for three to six hours

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:84%
sick and headaches
and all over agony,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
uncontrolled shivering
and fever and all that.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:90%
But not me.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Within a quarter of
an hour, I had it

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:90%
completely under control.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And it showed in the
blood analyzed later

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:84%
that I was suppressing
the cytokines that those

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.630 align:middle line:84%
are the inflammatory
markers in the blood, which

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
is the immune system, and
directly got the E. coli

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
bacteria specifically out of
my body, like neutralized.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But once again, they said,
yeah, but that's you.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.500 align:middle line:84%
You have been in
extreme conditions.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:84%
You are very-- you got a great,
big tolerance toward pain

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:90%
and fever and all those things.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.900 align:middle line:84%
You're a tough guy, and
you are the exception,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:90%
and that confirms the rule.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, let me have a group
of persons, test subjects,

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:90%
for 18 people come with me.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And how many time do you
need with them, a year,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
1/2 year to be a little
bit close to the results

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.845 align:middle line:84%
you have given in
that experiment?

00:09:29.845 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, 10 days.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And it became four days.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And in four days without
prior experience in the cold,

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
they were able to endure
five hours in shorts,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
enormous amount of
freezing cold on the body

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
because they learned how to
control their body by breathing

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:90%
and believing.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Now, believe.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
You think believe is
something abstract.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It showed that in an experiment
standing before an ice tank,

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I was able, just by standing,
thinking, motionless,

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
to increase metabolic
activity 300%.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
That's like running,
and there you

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
got metabolic activity, of
course, in the cell going on.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:90%
But now I was motionless.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me able to
stay, like, for two hours

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:90%
just because I think.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
That's my believing,
that I am able to stay

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:39.880 align:middle line:84%
in the ice for two hours and
have no core body temperature

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:90%
decrease.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
If you have that
power, then you have

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:84%
tapped into the depth
of your physiology

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the way nature meant
it to be in humans.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And that enables you to control
adrenaline, stress hormone,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:90%
to the fullest.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you are able to do
that and you get an injection,

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
say, with E. coli bacteria or
virus or anything like that,

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
then you are able to steer
directly the adrenaline

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and to attack the intruder,
the danger, to fend off danger.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria-- I call this, like,
dangerous impact on the body.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It makes the physiology maybe
not working so well anymore.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:90%
So you got adrenaline.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, I learned to control by
going into the cold little

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.220 align:middle line:84%
by little to
control the hormonal

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:84%
system, which is
in the brainstem.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Besides of it all,
we are also now--

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:90%
and it has been shown--

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:84%
in the deepest part of the
brain in control at will,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and it makes me able not only to
stay in the cold, extreme cold,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:84%
also in the heat, also on
oxygen-deprivation situations

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
like going in shorts on Mount
Everest into the death zone

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and fend off bacteria,
which is also a danger.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It's an impact.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:90%
It's an impact on your system.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So we lost this
ability, and now we

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
bring it to the lab
setting, experimental way,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
evidence based, showing
that everybody actually

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:90%
is able to do that.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:90%
So in four days, these people--

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I had to begin somewhere,
and I had only my belief

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
that we are able to do
it all just by breathing

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
and believing.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Four days later, I saw them.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
We were dancing on the top
of a mountain in shorts

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
in freezing
temperatures, minus 27.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the capability
of a human to endure.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Like a woman who
gives labor, there you

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:90%
find the power, the deep power.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
It needs to-- and it is amazing
when people get into this plane

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and learn to control it
and state they're in.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I found a way to get
there controlled, at ease.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:84%
We just completed
studies on pain.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
With the breathing
and believing,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
we are able to
tolerate pain far more.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, we lost this.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.290 align:middle line:90%
So now it's back.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And we are knocking on the
door with scientific evidence.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:84%
We are already in
the university books,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:90%
but it needs to come top down.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.170 align:middle line:84%
We want to bring back the
belief, the belief of mother

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
nature within.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:84%
It's there, it's there for
everybody, and it showed.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
All these 18 persons, 12
of them randomly selected,

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.030 align:middle line:84%
they were exposed
with the bacteria.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:84%
All they had control within
a quarter of an hour over

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:84%
the bacteria injected
reacting on the immune system,

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
which normally makes you fever,
creates fever, severe headache,

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
all-over agony, back
pains, muscle pains,

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.350 align:middle line:90%
uncontrolled shivering--

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.620 align:middle line:90%
all.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:90%
They made jokes.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.460 align:middle line:84%
They told me, the university
has played false game.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:84%
They injected us
with sugar water.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.900 align:middle line:90%
No, it was a real bacteria.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a real effect
on the immune system.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Only they had the control,
all of them, 100%.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
What consequences will
this give for health care?

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Just breathing, just
believing, that's

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
the way nature
meant it to, to be

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.250 align:middle line:84%
able to go in the depth
of your physiology.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Once again, nature, mother
nature has the answers.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I went into nature, and
now it's evidence based.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:84%
I did 26 of these stupid
world records, crazy

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:90%
television going on.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But I drew the attention of
the scientific community,

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:84%
then they got me in into
experimental research,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and it shows, now,
with groups of people,

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and we are doing ongoing
research right now

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
with five universities that
anybody should be doing this.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, we are grounding more and
more with scientific evidence

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to just to evade
speculation out of the way.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.340 align:middle line:84%
This works, brings you back
the way nature meant it to be,

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and that's the autonomic
nervous system related

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.525 align:middle line:84%
to the immune system and
the endocrine system the way

00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:01.325 align:middle line:90%
it should.

00:16:01.325 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:84%
You should be able to control
your mood, which is hormonal,

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.950 align:middle line:84%
your strength, which is
hormonal-- adrenaline,

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.810 align:middle line:90%
cortisol, epinephrine--

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
and your health, which
is the immune system.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And we showed it already
2 and 1/2 years ago,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and only now it begins
to end down everywhere.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.290 align:middle line:84%
People begin to
become aware, hey,

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe this guy really
found something.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we were and
we are the first ones

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.260 align:middle line:84%
in scientific history to show
that we are able to go back

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
to the depth of our physiology
far more than scientifically

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.720 align:middle line:90%
stated.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.210 align:middle line:84%
We are the first one to show
that the autonomic nervous

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
system can be influenced
deeply to prevent from disease,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.700 align:middle line:84%
prevent from depression,
to have a lot

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:90%
more control over your life.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.430 align:middle line:90%
And I call it--

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
if we are able to bring
this to the people--

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we
do right now here,

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.359 align:middle line:84%
like hacking or biohacking
or neurohacking, whatever

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
it is called- then we are able
to give the mothers the trust

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to guarantee their children
happiness, strength,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:90%
and health.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And that will make the
world a much better place

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:84%
because those are the most
important assets of life--

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
not money, not
grieving for power,

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:90%
no politics, no possession, no--

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.160 align:middle line:90%
happiness, strength, health.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Happiness is the mood, is
melatonin, serotonin, dopamine,

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:90%
our hormonal system.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
We have shown to tap
into the hormonal system.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can do it.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Strength-- same thing,
hormonal system.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And health, it is
the immune system.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So we have been translating it
into scientific evidence, data,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:90%
numbers.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.390 align:middle line:90%
No speculation.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:90%
And anybody can do this.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.620 align:middle line:90%
It's just tapping in.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Breathwork is chemistry.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Oxygen is chemistry.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:84%
We are breathing,
actually, not profound.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And it has been shown
that we are in the tissue.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:84%
We have been
showing, too, that we

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
have these devices, saturation
meters or oximeters,

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
and it shows that
there is actually

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:84%
an ability in the body to store
up more than 100% we thought.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:90%
It is 100%.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So the body is able to
store up more oxygen.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But we did not know how
to tap into that area--

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:84%
the lymphatic
system, the tissue.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And now it has been shown
lately with the completed study,

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and they do in the
Netherlands and Germany.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
It shows that we got more oxygen
storage capacity in our body,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and the storage capacity of,
say, the lymphatic system

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and tissue we could not get
into, but can become acidic.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And that means that it is
a storage capacity, but not

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:90%
ongoing.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:90%
You have to clean it sometimes.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But we were not able
to get into that.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, with this breathing,
with these breathing

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
exercises deriven from being in
the cold, going into the depth,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
not only being able
to resist cold,

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
but just going into
the lymphatic system

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and the tissue oxygenizes
every cell in the body

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:90%
and then becomes alkaline.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And the acid goes
out, and suddenly you

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:03.380 align:middle line:84%
are able to do so much more
because the nervous system is

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:08.030 align:middle line:84%
all about neurotransmitters,
electrical signals in the body.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And they travel far better if it
is alkaline instead of acidic.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:90%
So we lost that capacity.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So we are actually with
a surface capacity,

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know there is
more space, more ability, more

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's more power with
these breathing techniques--

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
once again, deriven
from being in the cold.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:90%
It's merciless but righteous.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
If you learn over there, then
you see it works in the cold--

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.210 align:middle line:84%
not only in the cold,
also in the heat,

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
oxygen-deprivated situations,
or bacteria or [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:84%
It enables you to reconnect
with the immune system,

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:84%
suddenly feel the
power that you are

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:84%
able, just by breathing
and believing,

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:06.990 align:middle line:84%
to prevent from disease, to
become stronger in performance,

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to gain confidence
and trust that you

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:84%
are in charge of your own
mood, health, strength.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And we will translate it
more and more into chemistry

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.120 align:middle line:84%
because there is
no way around it.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.280 align:middle line:90%
We already showed it.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.435 align:middle line:90%
You guys just get it on.

00:21:28.435 --> 00:21:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
They always ask me, you
know what, many literature

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:84%
has been written on breathwork
and by the nose, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.090 align:middle line:84%
the chakra breathing and the
Kundalini and the Sushumna,

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.790 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.236 align:middle line:84%
Where does it come
from, you know?

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Books have been
written, and you have

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to do it like this and
four seconds like that

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and then return like
that, and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Just use any hole,
get it in, breathe.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Become light.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Have it make a difference.

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Feel different.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you are doing,
then, is bringing in oxygen,

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:90%
getting out the carbon dioxide.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It begins to roam freely
throughout the body,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and it gets naturally
to its destiny,

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.890 align:middle line:90%
which is the cell, any cell.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.090 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:84%
You become lightheaded
at a certain moment,

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:90%
loose in the body, tingling.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:84%
That's just oxygen. And
oxygen that gets in the veins,

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:84%
in the tissue, then the nervous
system, all these wires,

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.420 align:middle line:90%
they begin to tingle.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.880 align:middle line:90%
It's oxygen. It's nice.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And the body becomes
alkaline within 20 minutes,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
from being [INAUDIBLE] too
alkaline within 20 minutes.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:84%
No need for water, no need
for anything, just breathing.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is about--
it's not complicated.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.122 align:middle line:90%
That's the complication.

00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:90%
You just need to do it.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Ah, but-- and it happens.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So you can get rid
of all the fantasies

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:90%
of what is enlightenment?

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.660 align:middle line:90%
What is good for me?

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:84%
How do I find relief
of my depression?

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:90%
What is the immune system?

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:90%
Get it out of your way.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:90%
You're feeling knows.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Just go by the feeling.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Do not force the feeling.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Just breathe and go into
the depth of your body.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.895 align:middle line:84%
You will find out
there is nothing more,

00:23:46.895 --> 00:23:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and then you are able
to become an alchemist

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
over your own chemistry, your
own body, and your own mind.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And it will reconnect
automatically

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:84%
with the neurology of the
brain and the cell management,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.210 align:middle line:90%
and it's all everywhere.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So as simple as it
is, it is there,

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and we are backing it up
with science everywhere,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:84%
like neuroscience, immunology,
the endocrine systems, on pain,

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:90%
on inflammation.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.570 align:middle line:90%
We are doing the studies.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:23.010 align:middle line:90%
It really works.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:90%
You guys just get it on.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not mine.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
It's knowledge
from mother nature,

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and it just passed
through me or something.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I just went into the
[BLEEP] freezing cold,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and it came about,
and I learned that I'm

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
very able to deal with it,
gives me enormous power within,

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.695 align:middle line:90%
and that was my aim.

00:24:47.695 --> 00:24:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But your aim could be
preventing from disease,

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.420 align:middle line:84%
having more control
over your mood,

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and to learn to be an
alchemist over your own body.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Feel the confidence that you
are in charge, charging up

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:90%
the body any time you want.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:90%
There is no dogma involved.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:90%
It's non-dogmatic.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Just breathing-- simple.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:20.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, if we can make
a choice in general

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
about going into
comfort or discomfort,

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:90%
the mind always chooses comfort.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.490 align:middle line:84%
At a certain moment,
you get a second nature

00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:36.620 align:middle line:90%
within the conditioning.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:84%
It always looks for comfort,
comfort, comfort, comfort,

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.580 align:middle line:90%
comfort, comfort.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:90%
But then a disease comes in.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
You become sick or
depressed, and you don't

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.320 align:middle line:90%
know how to deal with that.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is simply because
you always look for comfort.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
You never trigger the
physiology into depth.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you need it in
the depth to work-- say,

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:90%
the immune system--

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:84%
at will working against a
bacteria, virus, or anything,

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.470 align:middle line:84%
then we are not able
to use it at will.

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
We just become victims of
our, say, flu, fever, cancer,

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:19.740 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune disease,
depression, anything like that.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.260 align:middle line:90%
And I say--

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I believe, and I'm
doing the research.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I believe we are able to tap
in any time into that depth,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.490 align:middle line:84%
and then thing's
going to change.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Your way to prevent
from, say, actually

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:84%
anything that endangers your
functionality is up to you

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.580 align:middle line:90%
then.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the comfort,
the real comfort,

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is that you have the
trust, the confidence,

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
that you are able to tackle
any moment when invaders come,

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:07.280 align:middle line:84%
like bacteria, cold, heat,
no oxygen, bacteria, virus,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, or mood changes.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Those are all attacking your
functionality as a mammal,

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:90%
as a being.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.960 align:middle line:90%
And we can do that consciously.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:22.930 align:middle line:84%
We only need to do this
breathing, just deeper

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:29.240 align:middle line:84%
breathing, and sometimes a cold
shower stimulating the vascular

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:84%
system, which is a
transportation system.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And it brings about
energizing elements

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:84%
inside the body called
oxygen and it brings it

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:90%
to the immune cells.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Then the immune cells are awake.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:50.520 align:middle line:84%
When you have these temperature
differences, people get a cold.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:84%
It's only because you're
not adapting directly

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:84%
toward that change because
your immune cells are not

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:90%
really active.

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:84%
They are a little bit
because of the comfort,

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:90%
like a muscle non-trained.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.730 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know
how to handle it.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So what we do with
the cold shower

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:84%
is alerting the immune cells by
alerting the vascular system.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It's 75,000 miles, 1,000
miles inside of each of us,

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:84%
full of reflexes and
primitive muscles.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.430 align:middle line:84%
They are being exercised
by the cold shower.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Then the heart rate
goes down because it

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.120 align:middle line:84%
doesn't need to compensate the
loss of the vascular system

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:43.430 align:middle line:84%
to transport oxygen and the
right nutrients in the body.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.500 align:middle line:90%
So stress hormone is less.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart rate goes
down to its natural status.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It's far too high, and
it's creating stress.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's alarming
for a heart, which

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.050 align:middle line:84%
go, trying to compensate
to get the blood

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:84%
flow through because all these
little muscles and reflexes

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.030 align:middle line:84%
of the 75,000 miles are
not working together

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:90%
with the heart--

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:90%
lazy bones.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Then the heart is
trying to compensate.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It creates a signal
to the brainstem,

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
the primitive brain,
the reptilian brain,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
hey, there is danger,
stress hormones.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And that stress hormone
it's constantly,

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:32.710 align:middle line:84%
in the modern man, woman,
human in society, present.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps the
sympathetic nervous system,

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.230 align:middle line:90%
the action going.

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:41.720 align:middle line:84%
On cell level,
there is no peace.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:47.420 align:middle line:84%
There is no rest, which it needs
to rehabilitate for its energy,

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:90%
to store up energy.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Thus we get defense
systems of ours,

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.970 align:middle line:84%
they become lower because
they have no energy.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And we are working ourselves
even to burnout and fatigue.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Not only did-- very important
at the defense system.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.030 align:middle line:84%
It needs energy, and we have
all the systems to do that.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But we do not
breathe well enough,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.440 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it
doesn't get the oxygen,

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
and then all these processes,
like aerobic dissimilation,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.270 align:middle line:90%
they don't happen.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the defense
systems, of course,

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:32.080 align:middle line:84%
are not accurate toward its
ability to fend off disease,

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to any danger, not only
the cold, but also to virus.

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:38.680 align:middle line:90%
We got all these.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
We are exposed to all the
time to bacteria, viruses,

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:90%
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But if the defense
system is right,

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:84%
then there's no
danger whatsoever.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:90%
And we got it all in our heads.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And we can feel when we become
a little bit awkward, getting

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:84%
toward sickness or flu or fever
or any other disease, like,

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.150 align:middle line:90%
autoimmune, you know?

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:02.070 align:middle line:90%
We can feel this.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But we lost this
contact within to deal

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:90%
with that at that moment.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:90%
We take it for granted.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And we keep on in our
rat race, and we do not

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:18.240 align:middle line:84%
know how to stand still and
become aware of our physiology

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:84%
at that moment to maintain
happy, strong, and healthy.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.070 align:middle line:90%
We just not.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.050 align:middle line:90%
But now we got it.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So comfort, real comfort, is
the confidence and the strength

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and the happiness within and
maintaining it at any time.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Be the master of yourself,
and that feels good.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:50.640 align:middle line:90%


00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:84%
To begin with at
schools, I think

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:56.700 align:middle line:84%
this needs to be taught
in the primary school

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:84%
to begin with because we learn
about history and mathematics,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:84%
but we don't learn about
maintaining health, happiness,

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.550 align:middle line:90%
and strength.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I think those are the
most important subjects

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:15.030 align:middle line:84%
to be taught or learned
in school to confront life

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.230 align:middle line:90%
at any time.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.497 align:middle line:90%
And the rest is detailed.

00:32:17.497 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:84%
It's maintaining a
little bit of the-- yeah,

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
you have money for Brad and
have a house and et cetera.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But what if you have
millions and you are not

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:90%
happy, strong, or healthy?

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.560 align:middle line:90%
You ain't got nothing.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
are those subjects,

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:84%
and they should be
implemented in the schooling

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.370 align:middle line:90%
system, primary school.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Children like it.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.400 align:middle line:84%
They do it naturally
because they still

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.130 align:middle line:84%
have brown fat adipose,
and brown fat adipose

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:84%
is the direct defense system
toward weather changes,

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:84%
pressure changes,
that could possibly

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
lower our defense system,
then bacteria come in,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.070 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, or all.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:84%
But if the brown fat
adipose is there,

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.030 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn that and teach
that by university studies.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.450 align:middle line:90%
And I already did studies on it.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And I show that we are able
to produce, like, five times

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.010 align:middle line:90%
more energy while doing that.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I showed it in experiments.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.890 align:middle line:90%
They are written and published.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:25.450 align:middle line:84%
The thing is we have
an ability to tap

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:84%
into the specific
immune system, anybody,

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's related to
brown fat adipose.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
It's related to exposing
yourself in nature.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.330 align:middle line:84%
We got all the physiology
to be in nature,

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:84%
but we are dressed
up all the time.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
muscle non-trained.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't stimulate
the body anymore.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that we all
go naked in the roads here

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what kind
of world that is.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.950 align:middle line:90%
But sometimes it's like a dog.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:03.880 align:middle line:84%
It can't be sitting
all day along inside.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it needs to go out
running and being and be a dog,

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:90%
be a mammal.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
We got this
mammalian physiology,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:90%
and it works for us.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It's very healthy, very strong,
very effective against disease.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we just expose
ourselves a little bit more

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:28.310 align:middle line:84%
to the natural elements
that we start up,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:33.070 align:middle line:84%
you will find yourself
breathing more profound,

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and that will give
you the sense of power

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and not the cold
anymore and not the heat

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:46.409 align:middle line:84%
and not stress, in general,
will be coped with a lot better.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So then the defense
system stays alert,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and then our connection with the
systems, the hormonal system,

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system
is any time there.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.430 align:middle line:84%
You know what, it
creates confidence.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It creates a deep
confidence that you

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:09.330 align:middle line:84%
are able to tackle about
anything to maintain happiness,

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:90%
strength, and health.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Once again, related
to the hormonal system

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and to the immune
system, which now

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:20.560 align:middle line:84%
is being able to be
tapped in anytime,

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.750 align:middle line:90%
it becomes second nature.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It's going to serve you.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
You are just witnessing I've
never become sick anymore.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.860 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I feel good.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.090 align:middle line:90%
And it's because of confidence.

00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And what is confidence?

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Those are neurons.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Those are messengers to the
bloodstream, to the cell.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And it shows that if you
just positively think,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
then the molecular structure of
the blood becomes a lot better.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.270 align:middle line:90%
It clusters together.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:51.750 align:middle line:90%
It's strong.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:84%
When it becomes
negative, when you

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.340 align:middle line:84%
begin to have no
belief within yourself,

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.270 align:middle line:84%
then the neurons and
the signaling goes on,

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and it goes to the DNA,
it goes to the cell,

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.380 align:middle line:84%
it influences into the plasma,
and it becomes incoherent.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It becomes weaker.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So confidence is the result of
the evidence-based proof that

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:21.700 align:middle line:84%
we are able just at
a certain moment--

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:84%
like a car, you
learn, and then you

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:84%
don't need to mind anymore
about what you do, or a bicycle.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:35.500 align:middle line:84%
In beginning, it's difficult to
balance and traffic and this.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:84%
At a certain moment,
you are not even

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:90%
thinking anymore about a bike.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:84%
You just step on,
you go from A to B,

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and you witness the
beauty of the passing palm

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:51.100 align:middle line:84%
trees and bluebirds
and flowers, and you

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.900 align:middle line:84%
say, hello, [INAUDIBLE],,
because it's all serving you.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's the immune system.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the hormonal system.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we are able
just with our thought,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.700 align:middle line:84%
with our confidence-- once
again, the signaling--

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.770 align:middle line:90%
to handle it all.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And that may, in the end, handle
health, strength, and happiness

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:15.580 align:middle line:90%
any time.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:23.520 align:middle line:90%


00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:27.750 align:middle line:84%
More of these top
supporters are coming.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.040 align:middle line:90%
They are into performance.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.110 align:middle line:90%
They know the difference.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So when they feel
something trying it out

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and it makes the difference,
they are the one to notice it.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So he noticed
quite a difference,

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and it makes him able to keep on
performing actually much more.

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he is probably the
best surfer in the world,

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.300 align:middle line:90%
and he is still on with his age.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And now he finds this
breathing technique,

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and he's into it
because he feels

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
he is able to tap into that
system, which he called a flow.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.930 align:middle line:90%
They know what is flow.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes you
are not in the flow,

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.130 align:middle line:90%
but still needing to perform.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Now he is able to
maintain flow and to make

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.410 align:middle line:90%
the body a vessel of your mind.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:84%
What does your mind
want in this case--

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:27.110 align:middle line:84%
because we were talking about
signaling and cell energy

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.370 align:middle line:90%
management.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:90%
It wants to win.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.580 align:middle line:90%
It wants to give the best.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So he creates, with
this breathing,

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:40.610 align:middle line:84%
an alkaline environment, and
your mind is just fine, able

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:45.050 align:middle line:84%
to reach by signaling
neurotransmitters and neurons

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.460 align:middle line:90%
directing the body.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:90%
And there he is.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.130 align:middle line:90%
There he goes.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Surf on.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is not about
just Kelly Slater.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Kelly Slater is just a
person who is at the top.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
point out because I'm not

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:90%
too much into performance.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I just want to take away
suffering in the world, yes?

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:84%
But I use people like him
to show, hey, this works.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Even at the top, you
think you are at the top,

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.960 align:middle line:90%
you can go even better.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's by
reconnecting in depth

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.750 align:middle line:84%
with mother nature the way
the chemistry was meant to be.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:28.970 align:middle line:84%
So he is doing that nice, but
it's good for any surfer--

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.910 align:middle line:90%
no, for any person in the world.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Performance and
preventing from disease

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining
or having control

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.640 align:middle line:84%
completely over your
physiology, it's there.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:90%


00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe that a man
is being measured

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.630 align:middle line:84%
by the good he does for the
world, for human mankind.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.610 align:middle line:90%
It's called love.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And a real strong man is
able to pass on the love

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.530 align:middle line:84%
because he has got
enough within himself.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.990 align:middle line:90%
He has control.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.110 align:middle line:90%
He is a man.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:13.900 align:middle line:84%
He's a you-man--
woman, man, you-man.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And he controlled
himself within,

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.790 align:middle line:90%
and I did so many records.

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I passed this macho
bullshit and all that.

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I found my real
goal, purpose in life,

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.760 align:middle line:90%
which is helping others.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So too many homeless
people, too many wars,

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.610 align:middle line:84%
too many children without
food and shelter and love--

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:44.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm onto that.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.680 align:middle line:84%
That's my purpose, and
I'm going for that.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's my new angle.

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:84%
First it was bringing
about awareness

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.130 align:middle line:84%
that we are all able to
become happy, strong,

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and healthy because that's
nature, nature's way.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We have to get back to
nature and live in harmony

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.780 align:middle line:84%
with nature,
exposing, being, being

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.780 align:middle line:84%
a mammalian being,
strong and happy.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:11.590 align:middle line:84%
When you feel happy and
strong, you naturally

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.750 align:middle line:90%
want to share it with everybody.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the love.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I want the love to
come back in the world.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And they say with the Indians,
the natives, they say,

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.070 align:middle line:84%
man is measured not
by his possession,

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:84%
but about what he
is giving away.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think love is
the best emanation.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.390 align:middle line:90%
It's the best energy.

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
If you are in contact with
yourself in the depth,

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:40.330 align:middle line:84%
then you find not
only confidence,

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.880 align:middle line:90%
but you find the love for life.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.690 align:middle line:84%
When it begins to evolve,
then you are radiate it.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.080 align:middle line:90%
And radiance is nervous system.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Another person receives the
radiation, the resonance,

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
the brain waves, and
it creates this contact

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.660 align:middle line:84%
with mother nature, which
is, in the end, love.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And we have to share again.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.280 align:middle line:84%
That energy-- so
there I'm going--

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.240 align:middle line:84%
that's elevating consciousness,
but only to the depth

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.760 align:middle line:90%
of mother nature's will.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:21.650 align:middle line:90%


00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Very easy-- in the morning,
you are still in bed,

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:27.080 align:middle line:90%
so we are very tranquil.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Your body is de-tensed
up till the tissue.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Then you're without
food in the body,

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:84%
so the body's chemistry
is not into working.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not digesting the energy.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not concentrated
over there.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.170 align:middle line:90%
It's able to flow through that.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you do your
breathing exercise

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:53.225 align:middle line:84%
and you can show it to
yourself from being acidic--

00:42:53.225 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:90%
because at night goes on.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.610 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of acidic elements
come out of your body.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:90%
They get into your system.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:04.700 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself being
acidic when you rise.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But then within 20
minutes of this breathing,

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.180 align:middle line:84%
you will be able to become
completely alkaline,

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and that makes you very
much better performing

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:19.360 align:middle line:84%
during the day, very
much more in control,

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:90%
at will of your mood and energy.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Just do it 20 minutes, and boom.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And the transportation
system, which

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.340 align:middle line:84%
is the vascular system,
the 75,000 miles--

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.480 align:middle line:90%
just take a cold shower.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.310 align:middle line:90%
You got to clean up anyway.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So you take a nice
warm one, hot as you

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:44.700 align:middle line:84%
wish, but end cold, like,
half a minute to a minute.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.630 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:48.900 align:middle line:84%
That's just to
ignite, to stimulate

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.740 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful vascular system
who wants to work with you,

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but it needs some
activation, and it's

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.450 align:middle line:90%
done by a little bit of cold.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So only those two already
enable you to go far deeper

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.810 align:middle line:90%
in your physiology.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Then, little by
little, you find out

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.550 align:middle line:90%
you are able to do so much more.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, little by little,
the confidence inside

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:17.550 align:middle line:84%
of your own body and mind is
grown automatically, naturally.

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you become
the master over yourself,

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.330 align:middle line:84%
over your mood, over
your life, then you

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.610 align:middle line:84%
want to share because it's
natural, and that's the love.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't take yourself
too serious about--

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:44.240 align:middle line:84%
we're always controlling our
environment, but also blocking.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is don't
take yourself too serious

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:52.640 align:middle line:84%
means go to a different
place in your brain,

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find out
that you actually

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:58.460 align:middle line:84%
have a lot more power going
on, that your physiology is

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.780 align:middle line:84%
able to control actually
situation far better than you.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.180 align:middle line:90%
So there is more than we think.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And how do I make people
aware of that power?

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Just sing while you
go into cold water

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and you find out that you are in
a different space of the brain.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, not blocking the
process of your adaptive power

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:29.000 align:middle line:84%
within, which is very
capable of dealing

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.640 align:middle line:84%
with that immense aggressive
impact which is going on,

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.710 align:middle line:90%
you got so much power.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But if we block it with
our controlling mind,

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.110 align:middle line:84%
we think it is so cold
and this and that.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:42.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:46.490 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) Somewhere
over the rain.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:52.970 align:middle line:84%
You begin to just think in
joy, and the body completely

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:56.630 align:middle line:84%
relaxes, relieves, within
the aggressive impact

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.250 align:middle line:90%
because it's able to do that--

00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:00.200 align:middle line:84%
not only in the cold,
also in the heat

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.890 align:middle line:84%
or any other
stressful situation.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.870 align:middle line:90%
So that's the way.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Just make it simple because
people take things very serious

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:90%
and because it is serious, too.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:84%
If you take it too serious,
then, yeah, you stay there in

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.930 align:middle line:84%
and you never dare to
go out of that comfort,

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.940 align:middle line:90%
out of that control.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's learning to go
out of the comfort zone

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.120 align:middle line:84%
because the real
comfort, the real power,

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.100 align:middle line:90%
is deeper within us.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.180 align:middle line:90%
And for that, we need to go out.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And for that I say,
hey, I meet Dalai Lama

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.550 align:middle line:84%
because he understands
what I'm doing.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:45.910 align:middle line:84%
I do it by science,
take away speculation.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And his personal doctor,
Professor [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.550 align:middle line:84%
in New York Tibet
House, he taught

00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:55.810 align:middle line:90%
me a mantra, a Tibetan mantra.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.280 align:middle line:90%
And I can begin here.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.930 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:04.283 align:middle line:90%


00:47:04.283 --> 00:47:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Et cetera, et cetera--

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.520 align:middle line:90%
I can go on.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:09.790 align:middle line:90%
But I translate it into English.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's really effective on
the nervous system, making you--

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.310 align:middle line:90%
make the heat in a fire.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.880 align:middle line:90%
You could do more discipline.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
It makes it going, and it's a
deep discipline, esoteric, very

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.110 align:middle line:90%
ancient, very secretive.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:33.050 align:middle line:84%
We have translated it
into this, into English.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Now we brought it into
this strove of music.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you are able to recognize
it, then please sing with me.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Maybe just ancient, secretive--

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.540 align:middle line:90%
somewhere you know.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.860 align:middle line:90%
And then we will--

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.310 align:middle line:90%
everybody waiting.

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:54.110 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh maybe now we get
to know a secret.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.970 align:middle line:90%
And then we begin.

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:04.100 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Somewhere over the.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like the mother
singing to you.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Something deep is happening
because it actually is deep.

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.410 align:middle line:90%
It's touching us.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:90%
It's mother nature.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Things that brought
the attention

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.160 align:middle line:90%
by television, et cetera--

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.470 align:middle line:84%
but I was doing it a long time,
long time already before--

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.590 align:middle line:84%
completely controlled-- if you
can stay five to seven minutes

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:37.600 align:middle line:84%
under the ice, if you can stay
a whole night long in shorts

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.460 align:middle line:90%
in freezing temperatures.

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not because I had
no money for clothes.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I go into something which
is incredible, actually,

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.970 align:middle line:90%
which we lost.

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:52.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a lost ability of ours.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I just tested it, and it
worked, and it made me

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.660 align:middle line:90%
able to do all kinds of things.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly I found
myself with television

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:03.260 align:middle line:84%
after many challenges
which I have done already

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.270 align:middle line:84%
in hard nature,
so-called nature,

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:08.600 align:middle line:84%
like barefoot running
through the snow for hours

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and go and climb
mountains without gear,

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.350 align:middle line:90%
vertical, free soloing.

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:17.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is
like handling fear

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:20.600 align:middle line:84%
because you learn to
handle the control

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.460 align:middle line:90%
in the depth of your body.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you
go past the fear

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.200 align:middle line:84%
because the fear
is subconscious.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.080 align:middle line:90%
It's subconscious.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It knows-- the body
knows that you are not

00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:34.760 align:middle line:84%
capable to confront yourself
in certain extreme situations.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.020 align:middle line:90%
So there is fear.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's alarming.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:41.690 align:middle line:84%
It's signaling you,
telling you, hey, man, you

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:45.780 align:middle line:84%
are not prepared to go
into extreme situations.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Extreme situations can
be cold, can be heat,

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:54.690 align:middle line:84%
can be a bacteria, virus, or
any other accident of energy's

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:55.490 align:middle line:90%
gone--

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:56.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, cars, et cetera.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.460 align:middle line:90%
It's all energy.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:02.060 align:middle line:84%
This is existent nature,
and your body knows,

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:06.210 align:middle line:84%
so it creates the
fear as a signal.

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you got to do something
about it because we,

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:14.180 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously, have understood
there is possible situations

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.730 align:middle line:84%
to occur in the future, and
you've got to be prepared.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So I learned to deal with
that, to go past that.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:26.900 align:middle line:84%
That made me able to go free
solo without gear, climbing

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.570 align:middle line:84%
steep rocks, or
swim under the ice,

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:35.300 align:middle line:84%
do rackets under meter thick
layer of ice in Finland,

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.470 align:middle line:84%
or run marathons
barefoot through the snow

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:43.070 align:middle line:84%
without prior training
whatsoever, or do it

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:84%
in the heat, or
hang by one finger,

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:49.420 align:middle line:84%
or climb Mount Everest,
Kilimanjaro, all in shorts,

00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and many more things,
many more things.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm doing this
with groups of people.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.490 align:middle line:90%
And it shows that it works.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Last January, my
oldest participant,

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:07.640 align:middle line:84%
without prior experience in
the cold and/or mountain area,

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.640 align:middle line:84%
we climbed Kilimanjaro
in 44 hours--

00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.980 align:middle line:90%
76 years old.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And normally people say, the
experts, the physiologist,

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.810 align:middle line:90%
they say, this is impossible.

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:20.480 align:middle line:90%
It's irresponsible.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.620 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do that.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Human physiologies
were not made to be

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:27.440 align:middle line:84%
able to go in such
accelerating tempo

00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:30.720 align:middle line:84%
up to Kilimanjaro in
the zone where there

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.890 align:middle line:84%
is less than half
the oxygen. We just

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.170 align:middle line:84%
have not the adaptive
power toward that.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, this 76-year-old man,
without prior experience

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:45.160 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains,
he did it anyway.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And he did it well, and
it transformed his belief.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It brought him back
in his confidence.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Right now he's successfully
working with a lot of people

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:59.420 align:middle line:84%
with disease of life in which
we, as a system, health care,

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:03.050 align:middle line:84%
do not know an answer
then only barbiturates.

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
kind of medicines

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:08.840 align:middle line:84%
they put in those people,
and it doesn't work.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We do it with breathing,
believing, and food.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.800 align:middle line:90%
Food is very important.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Food needs to be food.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:21.280 align:middle line:84%
The processed food, they
messed up the chemistry,

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and our body is not
able to deal with that.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we become a lot
sick because of the food

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and the shallow breathing
together making us weak.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And then the systems
do not work anymore.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we become sick, and
then we go to the doctor--

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:38.980 align:middle line:90%
dependency.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know how
to go and tap back in.

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So the fear-- the
fear is a thing

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.570 align:middle line:84%
which is signaling
us that we have

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:58.000 align:middle line:84%
to deal with ourselves within,
not out there creating fences

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.330 align:middle line:84%
around our houses, to have even
a stronger car and all that,

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and it will not make the fear as
a signal inside of us go away.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:12.250 align:middle line:90%
And your body knows.

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But we have a way
to go past the fear.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.170 align:middle line:84%
That means it's
resetting the body.

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:20.590 align:middle line:90%
And how it's done?

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Breathing and
believing-- so breathing

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and believing, exposing
a little bit to the cold.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.890 align:middle line:90%
I say this-- like, freeze.

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:31.190 align:middle line:90%
And then I say this.

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:33.970 align:middle line:90%


00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:36.006 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

00:53:36.006 --> 00:53:37.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's all.

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I wish you all so much love
because that's who we are,

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and we have to share
this to the world,

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:46.890 align:middle line:84%
to everybody, bringing
back confidence,

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and this time a confidence
beyond any speculation, which

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.690 align:middle line:84%
makes you able to tap into
your mood, to your health,

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and your strength, the most
important assets of life.
