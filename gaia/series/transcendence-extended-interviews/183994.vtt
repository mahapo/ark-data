00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So when I was 26, I
got a huge wake-up call.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.160 align:middle line:90%
It was stage III colon cancer.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was a
real estate entrepreneur.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I was just working really
hard to build a business,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:84%
acquiring rental
property, learning

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:84%
how to manage properties
and run crews.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was just basically
going 90 miles an hour,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:84%
just a young, ambitious
guy, and also a musician.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So nights and weekends,
I was writing songs

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.590 align:middle line:90%
and doing that stuff.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, just was completely
derailed by a colon cancer

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:90%
diagnosis.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I had pain in my abdomen.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.655 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
gee, I don't know.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:56.455 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Do I have an ulcer or something?

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.922 align:middle line:84%
And I just ignored it
because it wasn't that bad.

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:90%
It would come and go.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.738 align:middle line:90%
Most of the time, I had no pain.

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But then I would just have
these twinges everyone

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
once in a while, these
weird, sharp pains,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
the kind where you're
like, whoa, what was that?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
But over time, over the
better part of a year,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:90%
it got worse and worse.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
I had a colonoscopy

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.370 align:middle line:84%
and they found this
golf ball-sized tumor

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:84%
in my large intestine,
biopsied it sent it to the lab.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you've
got stage II colon cancer.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:90%
This is an old person's disease.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.165 align:middle line:84%
They don't even screen for colon
cancer till you're in your 50s

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:90%
and I'm 26.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So it was like,
what in the world

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:90%
is happening to me right now?

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.390 align:middle line:84%
My wife and I had been married
for just over two years,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:90%
no kids.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:84%
We were just getting started,
just trying to build a life.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we were
talking about kids.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, this just completely
interrupted my entire life,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
A. And B, it was like,
well, I don't even

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:90%
know if I'm going to--

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:90%
am I going to die young?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to have kids?

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.210 align:middle line:84%
What's my future
going to look like?

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Are my parents going to have
to bury their only child?

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Is my wife going
to have to bury me,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that we've been together for
eight years, married for two?

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, all these
emotions was swirling.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And it was a really scary time.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.813 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing
that happens when you're

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.140 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with cancer is fear.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge stress and
fear bomb in your life

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
because all the sudden--
your life's probably

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.030 align:middle line:90%
pretty good or OK or whatever.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.228 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's great.

00:03:01.228 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And then all the sudden,
it's like, cancer,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
which equals potential
death, maybe soon.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you know the way cancer
industry and treatment works,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:90%
it means suffering immediately.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's surgery,
chemo, and radiation.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.820 align:middle line:84%
These are all brutal therapies
that you will suffer,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:90%
and especially chemo.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, instantly,
I'm afraid for my life.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And inside the cancer
industry, they really

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
use fear to motivate patients
just to say yes to treatment,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just that the culture of
oncology is, to the patient,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
if you don't do what I
say, you're going to die.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, the
patients are terminal anyway.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:90%
They're going to die anyway.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor is
not even telling them

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.077 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, by the way, this
treatment can't cure you.

00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
There's no way it's
going to cure you.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't cure anybody with
your type or your stage.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
But you have to take it
or you're going to die.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.520 align:middle line:90%
So for me, that wasn't my story.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:90%
My story was slightly different.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.070 align:middle line:90%
I had surgery.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:90%
They took out this tumor.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, you need 9
to 12 months of chemotherapy.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's worse than we thought.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:90%
We thought it was stage II.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:90%
It's stage IIIC.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's one click from stage
IV, which means it's metastatic.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Colon cancer is the second
leading cause of cancer death

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
in the US and in many
industrialized Western nations.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:90%
So surgery doesn't cure it.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And your only hope is that
the chemotherapy will maybe

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
mop up the cancer stem
cells and circulating

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
tumor cells that are already
circulating in your body.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:90%
And what do you say to that?

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about anything.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:90%
So I'm afraid I'm going to die.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.685 align:middle line:84%
And they're telling me that
if I don't do what they say,

00:05:03.685 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
then I'm definitely
going to die.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.532 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:08.532 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In the very beginning of
my treatment experience,

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I was rushed into surgery.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted to get me
into surgery the next day.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
This is how fast the
cancer industry moves.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.052 align:middle line:90%
Patients, they get a diagnosis.

00:05:28.052 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a whirlwind, like, what?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:90%
I have cancer now?

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.952 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and you're going to need
to be in surgery tomorrow

00:05:33.952 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and we've gotta
get this out of you

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:84%
right away before it
spreads and kills you.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what they told me.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like, we want to
get you into surgery tomorrow.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
The surgeon will call you
to set up the appointment.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like, uh, OK
like every cancer patient.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what's
happening to me right now.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And in my case, there was a
mix-up and they didn't call.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.445 align:middle line:84%
And then when they finally
did two days later--

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.845 align:middle line:84%
because this was two
days before Christmas,

00:06:00.845 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:90%
when I was diagnosed.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, great, awesome
Christmas this is going to be.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:90%
And they finally called.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look,
can we wait a week?

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to be in
the hospital over Christmas.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:90%
It's already depressing enough.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:84%
Can I at least not be in
the hospital on Christmas?

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.370 align:middle line:90%
So we postponed it a week.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But still, a week is
not much time either.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:90%
A week-- so I have surgery.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.713 align:middle line:84%
They take out a third
of my large intestine.

00:06:26.713 --> 00:06:27.880 align:middle line:90%
And they take out the tumor.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And they realize that it's
spread to my lymph nodes

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.452 align:middle line:90%
and it's worse than we thought.

00:06:31.452 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It's stage IIIC, not stage II.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And things were looking
worse and worse.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
It was just more bad news,
like, oh, now you need chemo.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.120 align:middle line:84%
You need 9 to 12
months of chemotherapy.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.653 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of chemotherapy
didn't make sense to me.

00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'd never had any
friends or family members go

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
through cancer, just
the idea of poisoning

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.293 align:middle line:84%
me to get healthier, that I'm
going to poison myself back

00:07:03.293 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
to health or that you're going
to poison me back to health

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.127 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to get really,
really sick but then somehow,

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
it's going to make me better,
I couldn't make sense of it.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a very
rational, intuitive guy,

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
which sounds like a
contradiction, sort of.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:90%
But I couldn't rationalize it.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:90%
It just didn't make sense.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I had this nagging
problem with chemo.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was also deeply insecure.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:90%
I was a deeply insecure guy.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the thought
of myself being

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:46.180 align:middle line:84%
reduced to this emaciated,
bald, yellow skin--

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:84%
just a cancer patient, that
was just an awful feeling.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I had an
aversion to it just

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:90%
from being really insecure.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to become that.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't know
what to do, though.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I go home
and we pray about it.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.267 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, God, if there's
another way, just show me.

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to do.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And this just
doesn't seem right.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm just reaching
out, like, help.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And I get a book that comes
to me from a man in Alaska who

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:90%
knew my dad.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
Sends me a book that
was written by a man who

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
had healed his own colon cancer
with diet, radical diet change,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:90%
raw food, tons of carrot juice.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:90%
And his cancer healed.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't a quick fix or
a magic bullet or whatever.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It was just a very deliberate,
systematic radical diet

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and life change.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reading this book
and I'm like, this is it.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I asked for something
and this book came.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.590 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to believe this
is the answer to my prayer.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I can chalk it up or write
it off as a coincidence

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.370 align:middle line:84%
or I can just choose to
believe, exercise my faith

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:90%
and be like, OK.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I did.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.678 align:middle line:90%
And I was excited about it.

00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:90%
I was reading this guy's story.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I was like, man,
this is amazing.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.112 align:middle line:90%
This makes so much sense to me.

00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And in 2004, nobody was talking
about the raw food diet.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.735 align:middle line:90%
It was weird.

00:09:26.735 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:90%
That was for weirdos.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.072 align:middle line:84%
I even worked at
a Wild Oats, which

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.280 align:middle line:84%
got bought out by Whole
Foods, and never heard anyone

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.740 align:middle line:84%
mention a raw food diet when
I worked there in college.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.620 align:middle line:90%
So it was even weird to me.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But it made sense, because
the premise is like,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.150 align:middle line:84%
hey, let's stop eating
all this fast food

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:84%
and junk food and processed
food, all this garbage and way

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.550 align:middle line:84%
too much meat and
dairy, and let's

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:84%
go back to this really
simple diet of food

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
straight from the
earth, unadulterated,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:59.040 align:middle line:84%
organic fruits and vegetables
in their natural state.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, I've
never done this.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:90%
This makes sense.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds a lot
better than chemo.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:90%
So OK, I'm doing it.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
I call my wife and I
was excited about it.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.480 align:middle line:90%
And she was not excited.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
She grew up in a very
conventionally-minded

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:90%
household.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
They went to the
doctor for everything.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't understand it.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in--

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
my mom was a natural health
nut kind of lady and shopped

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:84%
at hole-in-the-wall
health food stores.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And we always had little, weird
supplements and food products

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and stuff that my friends were
like, what is this, something

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:90%
with kelp in it in 1990.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.932 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the point is
I was comfortable with it

00:10:44.932 --> 00:10:45.732 align:middle line:90%
and it made sense.

00:10:45.732 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing that happened
was I had all these family

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
members start to
call me and tell me

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.642 align:middle line:84%
that I was making a
mistake I was like,

00:10:56.642 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:84%
well, I prayed and
I got this book.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, this is it.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.738 align:middle line:90%
I had so much clarity.

00:11:01.738 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And then all the sudden,
everyone around me

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:90%
is like, no, no, do not do that.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I know someone who did
alternative therapies

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:13.795 align:middle line:84%
and they died or don't
you think if there

00:11:13.795 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
was something that
worked better,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:90%
the doctors would know about it?

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I don't know
how to answer these questions.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I've only read the first
couple chapters of this book.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So then all the sudden, the fear
is back, the fear, the doubt,

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:90%
the anxiety.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all back and present.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was very tough
because I realized

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
my mom supported me,
but beyond my mom

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:84%
at that time, everyone else
who loved me didn't understand.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they couldn't support
me because it was just such

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
a radical idea that
they just couldn't--

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:84%
it was as weird to them
as chemo was weird to me.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:90%
And I realized I was alone.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:90%
And that was scary.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to appease
the people around me,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
I agreed to go
see an oncologist.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
They were saying, well,
will you please just

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:84%
go meet with them, hear
what they have to say?

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
OK, OK, I'll go.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.780 align:middle line:84%
But by the way, I had
converted to a raw food diet

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.240 align:middle line:84%
overnight, went out,
where can I buy a juicer?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.285 align:middle line:90%
Who sells them?

00:12:27.285 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Bought the juicer, loaded up
on raw fruits of vegetables,

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:90%
giant--

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I realized, whoa, they sell
these 20-pound bags of organic

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
juicing carrots,
carrots for making--

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, this is amazing.

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So I loaded up on this produce,
started on the raw food diet.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And then again, OK,
I'll see the oncologist.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:90%
So we go to the clinic.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's full of people.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
They're all twice my
age, three times my age.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I was a rock and roll dude.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I was playing in
bands, writing songs.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I had shaggy hair and
a handlebar mustache.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like,
what am I doing here?

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't even belong here.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:90%
And the TV is on.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And out comes Jack Lalanne.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Jack Lalanne is on the morning
show in the tiny, little window

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:21.243 align:middle line:84%
of time that I'm sitting in
the oncologist's waiting room.

00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And he comes out and
he starts going off

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.033 align:middle line:84%
about nutrition and natural
therapies and healing

00:13:25.033 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and the reasons
why we're all sick

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.992 align:middle line:84%
is because we're eating all this
junk food and processed food

00:13:28.992 --> 00:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and if man made
it, don't eat it.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, man, I
can't believe this is--

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.868 align:middle line:90%
he's on the TV right now.

00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:84%
There's no way this is not--
this is not a coincidence.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:90%
This cannot be a coincidence.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, can you
believe this is on right now,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:90%
to my wife.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, yeah,
it's pretty weird.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
So we go back and
see the oncologist.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And he gives me this
really standard pitch.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got stage
III colon cancer.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got about a 60% chance of
living 5 years with treatment.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, 60%
chance of living 5 years?

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.620 align:middle line:84%
That's barely better
than a coin toss.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.635 align:middle line:90%
What if he's wrong?

00:14:10.635 --> 00:14:11.435 align:middle line:90%
What if it's worse?

00:14:11.435 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't inspire
any confidence.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him about
the raw food diet.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no,
you can't do it.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.206 align:middle line:90%
It'll fight the chemo.

00:14:24.206 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, that's weird.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And I never asked
him what he meant,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.142 align:middle line:90%
but it was a weird thing to say.

00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I found out later
that the raw food

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:84%
diet is such a powerful
detoxification and cleansing

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
diet that when you're trying
to do raw foods and chemo,

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.502 align:middle line:84%
your body kicks the
chemo out a lot faster

00:14:43.502 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't really do as
much damage, which sounds good;

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:84%
but to them, they want it to
do as much damage as possible.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:90%
So they don't work together.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're also afraid that
any bacteria on raw food

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.520 align:middle line:84%
is going to harm you
because they've destroyed

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:90%
your immune system with chemo.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And so now, the
bacteria on an apple

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
might cause a
problem in your body.

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.943 align:middle line:90%
I learned all that later.

00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
We asked him about
alternative therapies

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:90%
and he said, no, there are none.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't do
chemotherapy, you're insane.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And that moment, just
a tidal wave of fear

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
just smashed me, it was like,
smashed me on the rocks.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And when you're under stress--

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.850 align:middle line:90%
fear is a stress emotion.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.470 align:middle line:84%
When you're under
stress, your body

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.922 align:middle line:90%
responds with fight or flight.

00:15:46.922 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And the fight or
flight response is

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.010 align:middle line:84%
it starts pumping hormones,
adrenaline and cortisol.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And those hormones make a
lot of physiological changes

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.525 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:15:57.525 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:84%
There are these
physiological reactions

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:90%
that happen in the body.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is your
brain chemistry changes.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:90%
You think very differently.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And parts of your brain
actually shut off, your ability

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to think rationally and
logically, analytically,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.600 align:middle line:90%
shut off.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And the part of your
brain that lights up

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
is the part that's really
wired for survival.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:90%
It's fight or flight.

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And that part is very
irrational and impulsive.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.330 align:middle line:90%
And so even your memory--

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:84%
your memory stops recording when
you're under extreme stress,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
which is why you hear
testimonies from people all

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:84%
the time that when they're
in a traumatic event,

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:90%
a fight or life-threatening--

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and they're asked, can
you tell us what happened,

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times, they're like, I
don't even know what happened.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.318 align:middle line:90%
It's like I blacked out.

00:16:50.318 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the stress
hormones interfere

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.943 align:middle line:90%
with your brain chemistry.

00:16:52.943 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there and I'm
in this hyper fear/anxiety

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's belittling me and
just talking down to me

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and just essentially
saying, if you

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
don't do what I'm telling you
to do, you're going to die.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:90%
And it's all blurry.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And something he said
just pokes through.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.601 align:middle line:84%
And he says, blah, blah, blah,
and I'm not telling you this

00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:20.809 align:middle line:90%
because I need your business.

00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, wait a minute.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:90%
This sounds like a sales pitch.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I was in sales and this guy's
doing the push away technique

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:90%
on me right now.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.918 align:middle line:84%
It's a sales technique, like,
I don't need your business.

00:17:35.918 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
like, oh, well, maybe

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.480 align:middle line:90%
I should work with you, then.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, man, business.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:90%
This is a business.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:90%
This is a business.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And this guy is actually
giving me a pitch right now.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And so even though I had
these little epiphanies

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and was getting these
clues at our meeting,

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.670 align:middle line:84%
the fear was so
strong and so powerful

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety
that like a robot,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I basically finished our meeting
and walked straight to the desk

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and made an appointment
to start chemo,

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
to get a port put in in a
few weeks and start chemo.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I walked into the
oncology clinic

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:25.940 align:middle line:84%
confident in what I was doing
and I walked out terrified.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of cancer
clinics are like that.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:90%
It's like a fear factory.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I made a
fear-based decision.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid I'm
going to die, so OK.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I guess I got to do
chemo if I want to live.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I walked to
her car and just cried, man.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
We were just so
upset and scared.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:90%
And we held hands in her car.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember us
sitting there just choking

00:18:53.270 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:84%
through a prayer and
just in true desperation

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
because my faith had
just been shattered.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.543 align:middle line:90%
My confidence was shattered.

00:19:06.543 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd been on the raw
food diet for a week

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:90%
and I was feeling good.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I really was.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:90%
But everything just got--

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
we used an expression
when I was in sales.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
It was called blowing
up the island.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.767 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
what it felt like.

00:19:20.767 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:90%
This guy just blew up my island.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I
don't know what to do.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I was fortunate
to have a few weeks

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:90%
before the chemo would start.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like, you
got to start tomorrow.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew I still
had to recover from surgery.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm still had fresh scar.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So in that time, I
thought back through--

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:84%
I was just praying a
lot and thinking a lot.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about,
why do I have cancer

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about
the weird stuff

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.705 align:middle line:84%
that the oncologist said to
me and the way treated me.

00:19:55.705 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
about the book

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:90%
that came to me from Alaska.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about Jack
Lalanne on the TV in the cancer

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.663 align:middle line:90%
clinic, all these things.

00:20:03.663 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
piece it all together.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.480 align:middle line:90%
And I wished I--

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I just so desperately wanted
an option that wasn't scary.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.820 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have one.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.493 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, I had
the chemo train

00:20:22.493 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:90%
that everybody's getting on.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:84%
It's state-of-the-art, luxury
train with the most comfortable

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:90%
chairs you've ever sat on.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And everything seems
beautiful and modern.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's cheering
you on and supporting you

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.615 align:middle line:84%
and they're running
races for you and stuff.

00:20:39.615 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, OK, it
seems really great.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.287 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
immediate suffering.

00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:49.620 align:middle line:84%
You're going to suffer as
soon as you get on that train.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And once you get on that train,
it's really hard to get off.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.563 align:middle line:84%
And then well, what
happens-- where's it going?

00:20:54.563 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
line, am I going

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:90%
to be better or worse or dead?

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And so there's that option.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the other option
is me going into the jungle

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.600 align:middle line:84%
alone, just hacking my way
through the jungle, no help,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:90%
in the dark.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.680 align:middle line:90%
And that option was scary.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:90%
I had two scary options.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:90%
And so fear was a big factor--

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:90%
fear factor.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And I just wished one of
them was easy and exciting.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what we all want, like,

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.250 align:middle line:90%
what's the easy path?

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.380 align:middle line:90%
And neither of them were easy.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that the
jungle path that I

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
had to hack my way
through alone was the path

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.660 align:middle line:90%
that God had shown me.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.980 align:middle line:90%
I asked for another way.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, OK,
here's another way

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:90%
if you want to take it.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
moment for me that

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
was a really critical faith
moment, where I realized,

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.962 align:middle line:90%
I have to choose.

00:22:00.962 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to choose.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.295 align:middle line:84%
I wish someone
would just tell me

00:22:03.295 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:90%
what to do and choose for me.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what most
cancer patients do.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
They just give all of their
authority to the doctor

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and just say, just
tell me what to do,

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and you just choose for me.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And they've abdicated all
of their responsibilities

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
to someone who probably won't
remember their name if they

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:90%
saw them in the grocery store.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And then there was the
full responsibility,

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:90%
it all depends on me road.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And if I screw up, if I
do this wrong and I die,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I look like a fool and I
become the cautionary tale.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:90%
And that was scary.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like, OK, this
is the test of my faith right

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:90%
If I step into this path--

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.043 align:middle line:84%
God, if you gave
me this path, I'm

00:22:55.043 --> 00:22:57.210 align:middle line:84%
just going to have to trust
you to see me through it

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:84%
because I can't even see
two feet in front of me.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
is even in there.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
this is going at all.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.780 align:middle line:90%
But I had to take it.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:90%
The chemo appointment shows up.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:90%
The day arrives.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And every day
approaching that day, I

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
got more and more
stressed and nervous

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.092 align:middle line:90%
and like, what am I going to do?

00:23:20.092 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:90%
And finally, the day arrives.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
like, I can't do it.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I just could not
see myself doing it.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.400 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't go, just no-show.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they badgered me
and called my house and left

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
messages on my answering machine
and sent me a certified letter.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
They were really trying
to get me into treatment,

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and eventually left me alone
so I could just be free.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And then once-- I
realized that every time I

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:84%
would hear from them,
fear would enter my life.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And the farther away I got
from the cancer industry,

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:84%
the more confident I got
and the less fear I had

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.305 align:middle line:84%
and the more of an
adventure it became.

00:24:04.305 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And to most cancer
patients, they

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:84%
don't look at it as
an adventure at all.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:15.210 align:middle line:84%
They look at the cancer
experience as just suffering.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just adversity and
obstacles and just struggle.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But because I made
this different choice,

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
yeah it was an adversity and
there was some mental struggle.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:35.100 align:middle line:84%
But physically, I didn't suffer
like a chemo patient suffers.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling really good
from raw food diet and juicing

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:90%
and all the stuff I was doing.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to rebuild my
body instead of tear it down.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to support
my body's ability

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.622 align:middle line:90%
to heal and not hurt it.

00:24:49.622 --> 00:24:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system is
critical to health.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you destroy
your immune system,

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:90%
you're just a sitting duck.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.165 align:middle line:84%
And chemo destroys
your immune system.

00:24:57.165 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:84%
As I started to read and
research more about chemo,

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, man, it's
worse than I thought.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I just started to look at
it like, this is an adventure.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:90%
I need to enjoy the process.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's coming next.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.520 align:middle line:90%
I just need to enjoy every day.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And every time fear
would creep in,

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I would have to
immediately catch it,

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.880 align:middle line:84%
catch myself in
those fear moments.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Because with cancer, every
single day, you're wondering,

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.210 align:middle line:84%
am I getting better or
worse, every day you wake up.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like the opposite
of a nightmare.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.365 align:middle line:84%
You know when you
have a nightmare and--

00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
have you ever had a
nightmare where maybe you

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.165 align:middle line:84%
lost your wallet or
something important to you

00:25:39.165 --> 00:25:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and then you wake
up you're like,

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:45.090 align:middle line:84%
oh, oh, it was just
a dream, I still

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.480 align:middle line:84%
have my wallet, or
whatever, or something?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Cancer's the opposite.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:90%
You're asleep.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:90%
You're dreaming.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Everything's good.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.785 align:middle line:84%
You're waking up and you're
feeling good and happy.

00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you remember
you have cancer.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:90%
And then the nightmare starts.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It's that nightmare
feeling every morning

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.870 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up to your reality
that is basically a nightmare.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And so every day, you have
this struggle with fear.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Is it coming back?

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.720 align:middle line:90%
Am I getting better or worse?

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to live?

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:90%
How much time do I have left?

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to be doing
right now with my life, all

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.500 align:middle line:90%
these questions.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And nobody's asking themselves.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.075 align:middle line:84%
They're just going about
their little, happy lives,

00:26:27.075 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:84%
punching the clock and driving
their little car around

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and having fun
with their friends

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and having drinks like
everybody else in the world.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.502 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so jealous of them.

00:26:36.502 --> 00:26:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody's just
so happy and oblivious

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm struggling
with this every day.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that
I had to get control

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.270 align:middle line:84%
of my thoughts and my
emotions, that I couldn't

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:84%
let my emotions rule me and I
couldn't let fear take over.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And so as fear would creep
in, I would just catch it.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I would catch myself in
the feeling, in the fear,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:90%
and give it to God.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I would just be like,
OK, you're in control.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.570 align:middle line:90%
I trust you.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm just giving you my fear.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm letting it go.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be afraid.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:90%
So I was choosing.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.660 align:middle line:90%
I was making this mental choice.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a difference
between your thoughts

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:90%
and your emotions.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And your thoughts can
influence your emotions.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:25.920 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times, we just
let our emotions influence

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, but
they don't have to.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:90%
So I had to train myself--

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and these are not
things I just made up,

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:84%
just reading other
people that had healed,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.400 align:middle line:90%
healers and survivors and--

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I was just learning about how
powerful our thoughts are.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And I had learned things
from success authors

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and being in sales.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So some of these concepts
were already there.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I just realized I had to
catch these fearful thoughts,

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:58.290 align:middle line:84%
give them to God, and make
a choice not to be afraid

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and not to worry, not to worry
about the things you can't

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
control, like, I'm just going
to focus on what I can control.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:90%
I can take care of myself.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.890 align:middle line:84%
I can eat this
hardcore raw food, tons

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.947 align:middle line:84%
of fruits and vegetables diet,
15 to 20 servings of fruits

00:28:10.947 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables every day--

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.510 align:middle line:90%
it was hardcore-- plus juicing.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And that much I can do.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And I can do supplements and
I can do some other therapies.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.160 align:middle line:90%
That much I can do.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.953 align:middle line:84%
The rest, I just
can't worry about.

00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:84%
I just can't worry
about tomorrow.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I have to enjoy today, now.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And once I started to think
that way and retrain my brain,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.030 align:middle line:84%
I started practicing
gratitude, I found this--

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:90%
it was like this--

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:47.240 align:middle line:84%
it was like an
undiscovered level of bliss

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:90%
that I could switch on.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was like-- man,
it was like a drug.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:84%
It was like the high on
life, like, I'm high on life.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, I always
thought was dumb.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And then all the sudden,
I was feeling it.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling the
high on life feeling.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't all
day, every day.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But I would get these surges of
just having so much gratitude

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.510 align:middle line:84%
just to be able to get in
my car and go to the store

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:16.455 align:middle line:84%
and get some stuff,
just to be on my feet.

00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I'd been laid up and
recovering from surgery.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So that reset my
perspective on just like,

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:84%
oh, it sure is nice to be
able to jog again or walk

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't do
that for a little while.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, I had this
really intense bliss

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:84%
that I was cultivating
through gratitude and then

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:84%
through taking every
thought captive, which

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:43.260 align:middle line:84%
is a biblical concept,
controlling your thoughts

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and catching yourself when
you're being judgmental

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:84%
or being envious or
criticizing others,

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:54.960 align:middle line:84%
criticizing yourself, letting
bitterness and resentment

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:84%
fester toward people
that have hurt you

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.070 align:middle line:90%
and wronged you in some way.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:03.240 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:07.630 align:middle line:84%
I realized I had a lot
of negative thoughts.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I was just a negative person.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I just realized,
man, I'm a mess.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm a mental/emotional mess.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how I got this way.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But over time, I just
became more and more

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:84%
insecure, at the same time,
prideful and judgmental and

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:84%
critical and just
awful on the inside.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Although I was trying
to be a good person,

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I was just awful not
to people physically,

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.160 align:middle line:84%
but just all these swirling
negativity and stuff.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I was looking in
the mirror and saying,

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:45.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, I have to deal
with this stuff.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't continue
living this way.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is why
I'm sick, because I

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:84%
have so much negativity
swirling around in my mind

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and that's translating into my
body and it's suppressing me

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.540 align:middle line:90%
and it's making me sick.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, later, I learn that
those same stress hormones

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that happen when you're
in fight or flight

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:84%
mode, adrenaline and cortisol,
when those stress hormones are

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:84%
pumping, they suppress
your immune system

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and they promote inflammation.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.953 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people,
many, many people--

00:31:19.953 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to hundreds of
cancer patients over the years.

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:23.945 align:middle line:84%
Every single one
of them tells you--

00:31:23.945 --> 00:31:25.820 align:middle line:84%
if you ask, why do you
think you have cancer,

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.470 align:middle line:90%
they always say stress.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:31.673 align:middle line:84%
They know that stress was a
big part of their problem.

00:31:31.673 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
all this stress,

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:84%
whether it's unforgiveness
or bitterness or relationship

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
problems or negative
thinking and envy, jealousy,

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.790 align:middle line:84%
all this stuff,
you are in a state

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.790 align:middle line:84%
of chronic low-level
stress, which

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is a state of chronic
immunosuppression

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.470 align:middle line:90%
and inflammation.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, man, this is
making so much sense to me.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I've got to change this
as fast as possible

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.060 align:middle line:90%
if I want to get well.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.130 align:middle line:90%
And so I was willing to change.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.422 align:middle line:90%
That's really the bottom line.

00:31:59.422 --> 00:32:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I was willing to change
everything, break

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:06.020 align:middle line:84%
all my bad habits and break
all my bad thought habits,

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.390 align:middle line:90%
which are the hardest to break.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Physical habits aren't as hard
as your bad thinking patterns

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:90%
and habits.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you break
those, it's very easy

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.512 align:middle line:90%
to break the physical habits.

00:32:18.512 --> 00:32:24.410 align:middle line:90%
So I just got busy doing it.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:84%
To me, at that time,
it was life or death.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, oh, I
should probably eat better.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:38.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like, everybody I know
knows I'm not doing chemo

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:90%
and thinks I'm crazy.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want to die a fool.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So I better be willing
to pull out all the stops

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and just go hardcore.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm kidding myself
if I think I'm just

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.200 align:middle line:84%
going to take a few herbs or
something and cure my cancer.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to do
everything I can possibly

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
do at the most extreme
level that I can handle.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Heroic doses of
fruits and vegetables,

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:84%
essentially, is
what I was doing.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And as I analyzed and
read and researched,

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, well, it ain't
chemo, so I'll take as much

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.860 align:middle line:84%
of it as I can stand,
whether it's garlic or ginger

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.740 align:middle line:90%
or cayenne pepper or whatever.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So that was the adventure part
happening at the same time me,

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:36.590 align:middle line:84%
having an adventure mindset and
trying to focus on gratitude.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Because gratitude is
the secret to happiness.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It really is the secret.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.350 align:middle line:84%
The secret to
unhappiness is when

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.505 align:middle line:84%
you focus on the
things you don't have,

00:33:48.505 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:84%
the things that
you wish you had,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.890 align:middle line:84%
the things that
other people have.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
When you focus on people
that have more than you,

00:33:55.460 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:84%
it fosters envy and
jealousy and unhappiness.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you focus on people
that have less than you,

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:84%
it fosters gratitude
and thankfulness.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Because you realize,
wow, I'm so blessed.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:12.139 align:middle line:90%
I have so much.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't live in a tin
hut in the Philippines.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm so blessed to be born
in the United States,

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:26.330 align:middle line:84%
in a Western nation
that has clean drinking

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:84%
water and electricity
and food everywhere.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And I have a family that loves
me and a wife that loves me.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.372 align:middle line:84%
So when I start
counting my blessings--

00:34:35.372 --> 00:34:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and then all the
sudden, it's like,

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:38.929 align:middle line:84%
wow, man, I don't
even know what I

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:42.530 align:middle line:84%
was upset about a minute ago
because my life is really

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.370 align:middle line:90%
so good.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the cancer
thing is a challenge.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:84%
But I have so much to
be thankful for that all

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:52.909 align:middle line:84%
the sudden, it just puts
it all in perspective.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And so gratitude plus
actively taking my thoughts

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and being-- mindfulness
is what they call it now.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Back then, I'd never
heard that term.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But catching myself thinking
negatively and changing

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.982 align:middle line:84%
the way I thought,
plus gratitude,

00:35:11.982 --> 00:35:13.190 align:middle line:90%
is the way I dealt with fear.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.613 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:16.613 --> 00:35:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.770 align:middle line:84%
I've thought a lot about
the stress connection

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
to cancer and the
mental-emotional-spiritual

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:34.640 align:middle line:84%
connection to your
physical body.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can make a
pretty strong case

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that stress is the root cause
of most chronic disease.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is why.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are
stressed, whether you're

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in a state of chronic
worry and anxiety or fear

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.310 align:middle line:84%
or resentment or bitterness or
unforgiveness, jealousy envy,

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:01.580 align:middle line:84%
if you're entertaining
those emotions every day,

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:04.010 align:middle line:84%
multiple, all of
them, some of them,

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:09.350 align:middle line:84%
whatever, then you stay in
a state of chronic stress.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And chronic stress
promotes inflammation

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and it suppresses your
immunity physiologically.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And so you create an environment
in which cancer can thrive.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.880 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't happen overnight.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, oh I
got in a car wreck

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.080 align:middle line:84%
and it was really stressful,
like, oh, no, I got cancer.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It's people that are living in
this state of chronic stress

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:40.070 align:middle line:84%
for years, usually, could
be even a decade of a really

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:44.810 align:middle line:84%
difficult marriage, an abusive
relationship, an abusive work

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.698 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:36:45.698 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:84%
They go through a
really bad lawsuit.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:90%
They lose their business.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:84%
They have a death in the
family or multiple deaths

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.720 align:middle line:84%
in the family or
loved ones or friends.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And I hear these stories
over and over and over

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:00.690 align:middle line:84%
from cancer patients when I
talk to them about their life.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a doctor.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.628 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a friend.

00:37:03.628 --> 00:37:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I get into
people's lives and I just

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.253 align:middle line:84%
want to know, like,
tell me about your life.

00:37:07.253 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And every time,
they always start

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.550 align:middle line:84%
telling me, well, I had
this really, really, really

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.360 align:middle line:90%
terrible job.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.840 align:middle line:84%
I changed jobs and it was really
awful or went through a divorce

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
or I lost my spouse,
lost my business.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:90%
So that leads them--

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:90%
it's like this.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.140 align:middle line:84%
They're teetering on the
brink of disease for years.

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And then oftentimes,
there's one traumatic event

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.824 align:middle line:90%
that pushes them over the edge.

00:37:35.824 --> 00:37:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So they've got chronic
stress for years.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And then bam, someone important
to them dies or their career is

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:50.210 align:middle line:84%
over for some reason or they
lose their home, bankruptcy.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call the
stress trigger or the cancer

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:90%
trigger.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just the straw that
broke the camel's back.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And then within a few
months or a year--

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:02.480 align:middle line:84%
you can usually trace
it back just a few years

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.827 align:middle line:84%
to a very traumatic
event in someone's life.

00:38:05.827 --> 00:38:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And then a few years later,
a year or two, they've

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.610 align:middle line:90%
got a noticeable size tumor.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:90%
They find a tumor somewhere.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you can make this
case, and I do make the case,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:22.580 align:middle line:84%
that stress is the root cause
of almost all chronic disease.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Because prolonged stress keeps
us in a vulnerable state.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a vulnerable,
weak state long enough,

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.680 align:middle line:84%
your body becomes a place
where cancer can thrive.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.460 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a person
that's been in chronic stress

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:43.100 align:middle line:84%
for years and they develop
cancer, well, guess what.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:50.150 align:middle line:84%
The cancer diagnosis itself is
a traumatic, stressful event.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And cancer patients can get
PTSD just from the diagnosis.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:90%
It's that stressful.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:38:59.900 align:middle line:90%
It's that traumatic.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:90%
It's that powerful.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:08.120 align:middle line:84%
They have symptoms
of PTSD because it's

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:11.182 align:middle line:84%
such a scary just
bomb in their life.

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:12.140 align:middle line:90%
And guess what happens.

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.682 align:middle line:84%
Well, all that stress has been
contributing to their disease.

00:39:14.682 --> 00:39:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Now they get a stress bomb.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And their immune
system goes even lower

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and they become even weaker.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.456 align:middle line:90%
And it's not uncommon to see--

00:39:26.456 --> 00:39:28.790 align:middle line:84%
doctors will often
tell a patient, well,

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:84%
cancer grows very
slowly typically.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And this has
probably been growing

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:33.860 align:middle line:84%
for many years in your body
and now, it's just finally

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.540 align:middle line:90%
big enough for us to find it.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But then as soon as
they're diagnosed,

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:43.160 align:middle line:84%
it starts growing very fast
and metastasizes quickly.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.000 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.710 align:middle line:90%
It was growing slowly.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And now it's
growing really fast.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:51.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the traumatic stress
response in the body.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:84%
It's even more
immunosuppression, even more

00:39:54.590 --> 00:40:01.950 align:middle line:84%
worry and fear and anxiety
that is weakening them further.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's scary.

00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
no one is talking about.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.304 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:09.304 --> 00:40:13.740 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:84%
I did a lot of stuff
to address stress.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.950 align:middle line:90%
The main things I did--

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.510 align:middle line:84%
there's two areas you
have to address in stress.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.990 align:middle line:84%
One is your thoughts
and emotions

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and the other is
your physical body.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And so as far as
thoughts and emotions go,

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.130 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I had to identify
all my stressful attitudes

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts and
emotions and really

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:84%
work hard to change the way I
thought, to change who I was.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times, we think
we can't change who we are.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And we can because
we are our decisions.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:50.200 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:56.235 align:middle line:84%
The decisions we make create
our life and create our person,

00:40:56.235 --> 00:40:58.360 align:middle line:84%
the way we talk to people,
the way we treat people,

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.840 align:middle line:84%
whether we're late
or early to work,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.000 align:middle line:84%
whether we work
hard or we're lazy,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.850 align:middle line:84%
if we cut corners
or if we don't.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So all of our decisions
create our reality.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So I was starting to figure that
out, that my choices mattered.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But then on the other side
of it, I was like, OK, well,

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:84%
yeah, my choices
matter and now I've

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:24.220 align:middle line:84%
got to change the way I think
and the way I deal with stress.

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But then also, are there
ways I can de-stress?

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Are there physical practices
that I can employ to de-stress?

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the best
antidepressants and anti-stress

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.560 align:middle line:90%
activities is exercise.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Not extreme exercise,
because that

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.720 align:middle line:90%
can have the opposite effect--

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:84%
it can actually tax
the body too much--

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.900 align:middle line:84%
but just walking,
jogging, tennis.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Any sporting activity
gets your blood pumping,

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.310 align:middle line:84%
moves your lymphatic system,
releases certain chemicals

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:02.320 align:middle line:84%
in the body that are mood
enhancers in your brain

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.350 align:middle line:84%
that make you feel happy
and content and satisfied

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and reduce your stress
and reduce inflammation.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So I realized, I need
to exercise every day.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I need to move my body every
day even if it's just walking

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:17.150 align:middle line:84%
or light jogging or bouncing on
a rebounder or mini trampoline.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:19.450 align:middle line:90%
So I was doing that.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I learned about deep
breathing, nothing super

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:27.580 align:middle line:84%
advanced, but even just
10 deep breaths, 10 deep--

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:31.210 align:middle line:84%
breathe it in, hold it
for 5 seconds, let it out.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, wow, OK,
I'm oxygenated my blood.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:90%
I need to do this--

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.060 align:middle line:84%
get out in the sunshine,
connect with the earth,

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.680 align:middle line:90%
take my shoes off.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, I got real
hippified, just really--

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and I was really trying to
get in harmony with nature.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I was really thinking about
living as close to the earth as

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:00.040 align:middle line:84%
possible and living as close
to in harmony with nature

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:05.440 align:middle line:84%
as possible without becoming
a hermit in the hills.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.320 align:middle line:90%


00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to leave my
wife and move into the forest,

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.760 align:middle line:90%
into a tree house yet.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.230 align:middle line:84%
But it was plan B, like,
if this doesn't work,

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.390 align:middle line:84%
I could always move out
in the middle of nowhere

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and live off the land and do a
40-day water fast or something.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But I was very
conscious of eliminating

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:35.560 align:middle line:84%
anything that was
modern that was

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.770 align:middle line:90%
in disharmony with the earth.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Because as our
culture has evolved,

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.500 align:middle line:84%
as civilization
has evolved, we've

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.920 align:middle line:84%
gotten away from
living naturally.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.640 align:middle line:90%
We use artificial light.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.440 align:middle line:90%
We use electricity.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.430 align:middle line:84%
We stay up way later
than we should.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting as much
sleep as our ancestors

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.930 align:middle line:90%
because we stay up late.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:57.387 align:middle line:90%
So even my sleep habits changed.

00:43:57.387 --> 00:43:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I realized, I need
to go to bed early.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:02.500 align:middle line:84%
I need to go to bed much closer
to when the sun goes down.

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And the seasons obviously
change throughout the year

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of
daylight we have changes

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:09.590 align:middle line:90%
throughout the year.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And so parts of the year,
you have a lot of daylight

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and you don't need
as much sleep.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.375 align:middle line:84%
But then other
parts of the year,

00:44:14.375 --> 00:44:16.930 align:middle line:84%
the winter, at
least in the US, you

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:20.290 align:middle line:84%
have a lot less
daylight and more night.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need more
sleep in the winter.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So I was thinking
about these things

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and really made changes
in my life that way,

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:32.200 align:middle line:84%
too, to, again, just try to
live in harmony with the earth,

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:84%
with nature, eating
food from the earth,

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:40.530 align:middle line:84%
just trying to
figure it all out.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.650 align:middle line:90%
And it all helped.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:43.450 align:middle line:90%
All of those--

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:46.900 align:middle line:84%
We know now just from
science that lack of sleep

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.030 align:middle line:84%
is a major stress
promoter in the body.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Lack of sleep, you end up
with elevated stress hormones,

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:56.710 align:middle line:84%
adrenaline and cortisol, which
suppress your immune system

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.270 align:middle line:90%
and promote inflammation.

00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:59.350 align:middle line:90%
Sleep is critical.

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:01.840 align:middle line:90%
So we know that I'm getting--

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.640 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people need--

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.105 align:middle line:84%
it's just common-- you hear all
the time-- people say, oh, you

00:45:07.105 --> 00:45:08.980 align:middle line:84%
need six to eight hours
of sleep every night.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Some people need way
more than that, 8 to 10.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm more in
the 8 to 10 range.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's fine.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:17.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine with it.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.490 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunate that
we live in a culture

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.100 align:middle line:84%
where people are so
obsessed with success

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.140 align:middle line:90%
and achievement that they--

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly reading
articles about life hacking

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:34.610 align:middle line:84%
or hacking the human body,
biohacking, where, how

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:40.880 align:middle line:84%
can I function at peak
performance 23 hours a day

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and only function
on 1 hour's sleep?

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I need to drink
this special coffee

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.930 align:middle line:90%
concoction and or whatever.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm totally not
into that at all.

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
biohack anything.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I just want to live naturally
in tune with the earth

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and be healthy.

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And if I need 8 to 10
hours of sleep, so be it.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I also set limits on
my workday beyond that.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I realized being a
workaholic is not healthy.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I started really
cutting my workday down

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and spending time with my
family and with my wife.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And guess what happens
when you spend time

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:18.265 align:middle line:90%
with people you love.

00:46:18.265 --> 00:46:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Your stress goes down.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, there's so much
we can do to reduce stress.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
identifying all of the things

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're doing
in modern society

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.460 align:middle line:84%
or just what our daily
routines look like,

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:39.075 align:middle line:84%
so much of our daily
routine is stress-promoting.

00:46:39.075 --> 00:46:42.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's so many easy
changes you can make,

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.710 align:middle line:84%
getting more sleep,
exercising, eating

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:48.570 align:middle line:84%
a diet that's rich in fruits
and vegetables from the earth,

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.050 align:middle line:84%
plant-based diet, not
eating much meat and dairy

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and processed food
and junk food,

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.920 align:middle line:84%
spending time with your loved
ones, breathing fresh air,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.350 align:middle line:84%
getting sunshine,
connecting with the earth.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.090 align:middle line:90%
All these things are not hard.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Most of them don't
cost anything.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have such a deeply
profound and measurable effect

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:12.890 align:middle line:84%
on the human body
and on our stress.

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was just like I was on
an adventure, this healing

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.950 align:middle line:90%
adventure.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was a systematic
process of discovery,

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:24.980 align:middle line:84%
of trying to figure
out, what all can

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I possibly change to help
me get well and stay well

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:35.368 align:middle line:84%
and to help my immune system
deal with the existing cancer

00:47:35.368 --> 00:47:37.160 align:middle line:84%
cells that are circulating
in my body, that

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.640 align:middle line:84%
are looking for a new place
to set up camp and start

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.240 align:middle line:90%
reproducing?

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.440 align:middle line:90%
And I did it.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.240 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.500 align:middle line:90%
I just changed up my whole life.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I did everything I could find
and afford, made no excuses,

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.740 align:middle line:84%
took full responsibility
for my health,

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.615 align:middle line:84%
and trusted God to
lead me in the process.

00:47:56.615 --> 00:48:00.216 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:48:00.216 --> 00:48:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:08.680 align:middle line:84%
About three months
after I was diagnosed,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I had decided I
wasn't doing chemo.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:13.792 align:middle line:84%
I'd decided I was
determined to live.

00:48:13.792 --> 00:48:15.000 align:middle line:90%
That's really important, too.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Because I asked myself--

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:22.240 align:middle line:84%
someone challenged me and said,
do you really want to live?

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I don't know.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I've never asked myself
that question before.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.250 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know if I do.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of scared,
what if I don't?

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I was scared to ask
myself that question.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And it was one of those--

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:41.790 align:middle line:84%
this woman asked me-- this is
a natural health practitioner.

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:42.930 align:middle line:90%
She asked me the question.

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And then it was almost
like time froze.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.750 align:middle line:90%
And I was in my head.

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And I felt this fear of, like,
what if I secretly want to die?

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
my insecurities

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:03.590 align:middle line:84%
and not loving myself and
really secretly hating myself--

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:10.500 align:middle line:84%
that maybe my body was dying and
the cancer was a part of that.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe I secretly
didn't want to live.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But then I also had this
amazing epiphany, just in that--

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.580 align:middle line:84%
you know how your
brain is firing, it's--

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.242 align:middle line:90%
who knows how fast?

00:49:22.242 --> 00:49:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is like a computer
and all these thoughts,

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:25.320 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.000 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized,
wait a minute.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.840 align:middle line:90%
I have a choice.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.260 align:middle line:90%
I can choose to live.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I made the choice and
I said yes, I want to live.

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I just-- OK, this
is just a choice.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice I can make.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.770 align:middle line:90%
My fate is not predetermined.

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
this choice to live.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And so because I made
that choice to live,

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:52.280 align:middle line:84%
then it made me start
thinking about the future.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going to live.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And I started making
plans for the future.

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.958 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, well what do
I want experience from life?

00:49:58.958 --> 00:50:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, I want to be a dad.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
it's like to be a dad.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm 26.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't planning on
being a dad this soon.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But I also don't know how
much time I have to live.

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't certain I
was going to beat cancer.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.430 align:middle line:90%
But I wanted to start a family.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife and I had this
conversation just a few months

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.000 align:middle line:90%
after I was diagnosed.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
maybe having kids and stuff.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And it was a delicate subject.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I don't remember what I
said to her, but we talked.

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said something
like, I don't know;

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I want to start a family.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.540 align:middle line:90%
And she did, too.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was, I feel like,
braver than me, saying yes

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:01.140 align:middle line:84%
to have my child not
knowing if I was going to be

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.640 align:middle line:90%
there to help her raise it.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.940 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we did the things
that people do when

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.230 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to have a baby.

00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:13.420 align:middle line:90%
And she got pregnant right away.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And so one year after
I was diagnosed,

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.120 align:middle line:84%
basically, we had
our first child.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I had even
more reason to live.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had this new infusion
of joy and purpose in my life.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And I think that was a big part.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:36.620 align:middle line:84%
I really think it
helped me in some way,

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.120 align:middle line:84%
maybe a huge way,
maybe a small way.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:43.350 align:middle line:84%
But just the fact that I was
bringing a baby into the world

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:45.607 align:middle line:84%
and it was something that
I needed to take care of

00:51:45.607 --> 00:51:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and my wife needed take care
of and I needed to be there

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.460 align:middle line:84%
for, I needed to
live for, it was just

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.530 align:middle line:90%
another reason to live.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just amazing
to me that my wife

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:03.330 align:middle line:84%
was willing to do that, that
she loved me so much that she

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:05.430 align:middle line:90%
was willing to have my kid.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.740 align:middle line:84%
We had a beautiful baby
girl, healthy girl.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:14.100 align:middle line:84%
She's 11 now and she's just a
total tween, man, total tween.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:17.760 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, my wife
loved me so much

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.870 align:middle line:84%
that she was willing
to take that huge risk.

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:25.522 align:middle line:84%
And then we had another girl
about 3 and 1/2 years later.

00:52:25.522 --> 00:52:26.730 align:middle line:90%
And so now, I have two girls.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:28.840 align:middle line:90%
They're 8 and 11.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.770 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy to think about.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny
because we have two--

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to throw
anyone under the bus here,

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:44.370 align:middle line:90%
but there's my mom and her mom.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And one of the moms was very
excited when we told them.

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.640 align:middle line:90%
And the other mom was not.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.140 align:middle line:84%
The other mom was
like, well, don't you

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:59.730 align:middle line:84%
think you probably should wait
till you're out of the woods?

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little
bit like, really?

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Thanks a lot for that.

00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:10.050 align:middle line:90%
But when is out of the woods?

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Was that five years from now?

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.770 align:middle line:90%
What if I'm dead?

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:16.637 align:middle line:90%
When is a good time to do this?

00:53:16.637 --> 00:53:17.470 align:middle line:90%
But it was too late.

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:19.500 align:middle line:84%
She was pregnant,
so that's fine.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we're
having this baby.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:27.340 align:middle line:90%
But I'm just so glad I did.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:31.050 align:middle line:84%
If I had done
chemotherapy, it was very

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.270 align:middle line:90%
likely I would've been sterile.

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:36.570 align:middle line:84%
It's also very likely
I'd be dead today.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:39.955 align:middle line:84%
Because I've seen so many people
suffer and die after chemo when

00:53:39.955 --> 00:53:41.580 align:middle line:84%
they were made all
these promises that,

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:84%
oh, you'll live longer or
we can beat this with chemo,

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.350 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I had a person very
close to me that

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:57.280 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed with the same
cancer I had, years after me.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.080 align:middle line:90%
It was stage IV.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And they told him, if
you do chemotherapy,

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.760 align:middle line:84%
you'll probably live
one to two years.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.020 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do
chemotherapy, you're

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:13.020 align:middle line:90%
going to die in six months.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if a doctor tells you one
to two years versus six months,

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:19.800 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to pick?

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't ask
me for any advice.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And he went with
the chemotherapy.

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And he was dead in three
months, three months, man.

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:38.083 align:middle line:84%
So I hear those kind of stories
all the time, all the time.

00:54:38.083 --> 00:54:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Patients are given this, chemo
will give you so much more life

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and if you do nothing,
you're just a goner.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And then it never
works out that way.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:50.866 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:54:50.866 --> 00:54:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I talk to a lot of
cancer patients.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to hundreds
of cancer patients.

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And the first
questions that I always

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:08.110 align:middle line:84%
ask them to try to help them
understand their situation

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and get clarity on
their life and for me

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:17.230 align:middle line:84%
to understand what they're going
through and where they are is--

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:24.380 align:middle line:84%
the first question is, why
do you think you have cancer?

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the answers
to that is always stress.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:33.760 align:middle line:84%
The second question is, do
you really want to live?

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Some cancer patients, a small
percentage, it might be 10%,

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.320 align:middle line:90%
don't want to live.

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.220 align:middle line:90%
They're ready to die.

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:46.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.918 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they've had a long
life and they're older

00:55:49.918 --> 00:55:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're satisfied
with their life

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.470 align:middle line:90%
and they're just OK with it.

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.293 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
famous woman that--

00:55:56.293 --> 00:55:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I believe her name is Norma.

00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.330 align:middle line:90%
And she was in her 90s.

00:55:58.330 --> 00:55:59.890 align:middle line:84%
She got a terminal
cancer diagnosis.

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And she refused all treatment
and went on this big road trip

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:04.090 align:middle line:90%
around the US.

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- "Driving
Miss Norma," I think,

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.930 align:middle line:90%
was the Facebook page.

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And they made this
Facebook page,

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and posting pictures of her at
the Grand Canyon and skydiving,

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.590 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of stuff, just having
all these adventures as she's

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:18.460 align:middle line:90%
93 years old, I think--

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.840 align:middle line:90%
maybe 91, but whatever--

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.152 align:middle line:90%
and made this choice.

00:56:23.152 --> 00:56:24.610 align:middle line:84%
She was ready to
die and she wanted

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:25.860 align:middle line:90%
to enjoy the rest of her life.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was fine.

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Some cancer patients are
ready to die because they've

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:35.770 align:middle line:84%
had a very difficult life
and cancer is a way out

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.660 align:middle line:90%
if you just had a hard life.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're really deeply
depressed and discouraged

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:43.310 align:middle line:90%
and unhappy.

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:45.610 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's OK.

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So you got maybe 10%
of cancer patients,

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.370 align:middle line:84%
this is just my
rough estimation,

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:51.970 align:middle line:90%
that are ready to die.

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got the
rest that want to live.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Most of them, even if
they're ready to die,

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.570 align:middle line:84%
it's very few of them that
will admit they are but you

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.740 align:middle line:90%
can tell by their actions.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that want to
live, I have to ask them why.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.120 align:middle line:90%
So do you want to live?

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.210 align:middle line:90%
What do you have to live for?

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I make them
think about it.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I want them to think
about what they have

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.910 align:middle line:90%
to live for and figure it out.

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And oh, well, I have two
kids that are in high school

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.710 align:middle line:84%
or I want to see my
grandkids graduate

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:42.910 align:middle line:90%
from college or whatever.

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And so having that strong
not only will to live,

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:54.130 align:middle line:84%
but something to live
for is really important.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you see with
older people, even sometimes

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:01.960 align:middle line:84%
just middle age and
older, is they run out

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.800 align:middle line:90%
of things to live for.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.850 align:middle line:90%
They've raised their kids.

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're not really in
touch with their grandkids

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they're not
that close to them.

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they're retired
or close to retirement.

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And they feel like they've
lost their life's purpose.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They're just
drifting through life

00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:25.090 align:middle line:84%
not really making a
difference in the world

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:29.050 align:middle line:90%
or in anyone's life around them.

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, they just
don't have a will

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:35.390 align:middle line:84%
to live because they
lost their purpose,

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.540 align:middle line:90%
or maybe never found it.

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what I try to do
is help people find that,

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:43.110 align:middle line:84%
help them figure out what
they have to live for.

00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And once you do--

00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:49.880 align:middle line:90%
like for me, I had three--

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.500 align:middle line:84%
well, in the beginning, I had
two major motivators for me.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.340 align:middle line:84%
The first was the thought
of my wife burying me.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:01.570 align:middle line:84%
We've been together for
eight years, married for two.

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I just couldn't
bear the thought of it.

00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And then equally
as hard to bear was

00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:12.055 align:middle line:84%
the thought of my parents
burying their only child.

00:59:12.055 --> 00:59:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:20.080 align:middle line:84%
That was such a painful thought,
just to even just put myself

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:23.322 align:middle line:84%
in their shoes or empathize
or whatever and just

00:59:23.322 --> 00:59:25.030 align:middle line:84%
think about what it'd
be like to bury me.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm super special,
but I mean a lot to them.

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm their whole world.

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm their whole world.

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:32.410 align:middle line:90%
They're my parents.

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:33.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm their only kid.

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pretty much
my wife's whole world.

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And so right in the
beginning, those

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:42.940 align:middle line:90%
are my two strong motivators.

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:47.530 align:middle line:84%
The third, to a
lesser degree, was

00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:49.150 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to experience life.

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:51.970 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to have successes.

00:59:51.970 --> 00:59:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to have kids.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.860 align:middle line:90%
I was 26.

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:58.590 align:middle line:90%
I still felt like a teenager.

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I'm just
getting started here.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I want more out
of life than what

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten so
far, which is like,

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.930 align:middle line:90%
I've barely made any money.

01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I barely got to do anything
really cool or fun.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I had made some
good memories, of course,

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.020 align:middle line:90%
like anybody in their 20s.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I felt
like, wow, there's

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:20.710 align:middle line:84%
so much I want to
do with my life

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and figure out and learn
and explore and whatever.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.930 align:middle line:90%


01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:28.225 align:middle line:84%
But I was also afraid to
make plans for the future.

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:31.090 align:middle line:90%


01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I was afraid to because I don't
know if I was going to die

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.810 align:middle line:90%
or not.

01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that fear
of, I don't know;

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to think too
far ahead because what if I

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.220 align:middle line:90%
can't get there--

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
but I realized that making
plans for the future

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
was one of the best things I
could do because it got me out

01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:56.590 align:middle line:90%
of now.

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
It got me out of my
present problems.

01:00:58.870 --> 01:01:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And it got me thinking
through them and past them.

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And it got me in
this I don't know,

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.820 align:middle line:90%
success mindset or something.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Someone else could probably
explain it better than me.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But once my wife and
I decided to have kids

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and she got pregnant, then it's
like, OK, now I have a future.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Now I have another thing
on my reasons to live

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:23.160 align:middle line:90%
and things I need to live for.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we can
actually create things

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:30.430 align:middle line:84%
to live for when
previously, we had none.

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking for
something to life for,

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.428 align:middle line:90%
just go get somebody pregnant.

01:01:36.428 --> 01:01:37.228 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:01:37.228 --> 01:01:40.252 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:01:40.252 --> 01:01:45.032 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.032 --> 01:01:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man.

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I've never done that.

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:50.790 align:middle line:90%
That's an amazing thought.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing--
thinking about this now

01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:01.020 align:middle line:84%
makes me want to thank them
and help them understand

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:04.380 align:middle line:90%
how they helped me survive.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.970 align:middle line:90%
And they're still pretty young.

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
They know their
dad's the cancer guy

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and they know I'm
famous on the internet.

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:15.720 align:middle line:90%


01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't had really
deep conversations about life

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and cancer and what I was
going through mentally

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally back
then because feel

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:35.318 align:middle line:84%
like it's a little heavy
for them at this age.

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But maybe we'll talk
about that soon.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:40.020 align:middle line:90%


01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the speakers
at this conference,

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
who it was, reminded me

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:46.110 align:middle line:90%
of this quote I've heard before.

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:50.550 align:middle line:90%
But it was that your children--

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing, but it's like,
your children basically teach

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:57.055 align:middle line:90%
you what's wrong with you.

01:02:57.055 --> 01:02:57.855 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:57.855 --> 01:03:01.278 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:05.200 align:middle line:90%


01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
As I was reading and learning
and trying to figure out

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
how I could help
myself more, I stumbled

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
across visualization and
affirmations and some of it,

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
again, I knew because I had read
successful people books, being

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:24.340 align:middle line:84%
in sales and being
an entrepreneur,

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
but had never really
practiced those things.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.005 align:middle line:84%
Because I always
thought, I don't know.

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They seem hokey and it's
a little bit embarrassing

01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:34.608 align:middle line:84%
to picture myself in front of
a mirror like Stuart Smalley

01:03:34.608 --> 01:03:35.650 align:middle line:90%
on "Saturday Night Live."

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.410 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But I was like,
I don't care now.

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:43.430 align:middle line:90%
I'll do anything.

01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that
I am above if it's

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:50.025 align:middle line:90%
going to help me get well.

01:03:50.025 --> 01:03:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And it started to make
more sense to me, too.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that our thoughts
have power and so do our words.

01:03:57.910 --> 01:04:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I started speaking
life into my body.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I started speaking like,
I'm healed, I'm healthy,

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and I'm well, over
and over again.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.390 align:middle line:90%
I would just speak it out loud.

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:13.183 align:middle line:84%
And I would think it
throughout the day.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts
create your reality.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible says as a
man thinketh, so he is.

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:22.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a super
famous piece of wisdom

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
that has been repeated ad
nauseam in the success world.

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
"As a Man Thinketh"
is a very famous book.

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's straight
out of Proverbs.

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like, as a
man thinks, so he is.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, I'm going to
start thinking, I am healed,

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm healthy, I'm well.

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- over
and over and over.

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:42.030 align:middle line:90%
So that was a big--

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:43.795 align:middle line:84%
just like, I'm
healed, I'm healthy,

01:04:43.795 --> 01:04:46.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm well, over and over.

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't really
get into deep visualization,

01:04:51.400 --> 01:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
but I would think about myself
in the future periodically.

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a daily
discipline, but just I

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
would try to think about
myself in the future as a dad

01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and as a granddad and
visualizing myself

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.610 align:middle line:90%
as a grandfather.

01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of, again,
making plans for the future.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And so whether making
plans and visualization--

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.050 align:middle line:90%
they're interconnected.

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:27.190 align:middle line:90%
And I feel like it was helpful.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I know the affirmations
were helpful.

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:31.300 align:middle line:90%
They help me now.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
I do stupid stuff like, I'm
worthy, I'm smart, I'm capable.

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I have to talk to
myself sometimes.

01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:42.865 align:middle line:84%
Because that doubt creeps
in when you're doing stuff.

01:05:42.865 --> 01:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
When you're a speaker
and you're around a lot

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.662 align:middle line:84%
of successful people, you tend
to have imposter syndrome where

01:05:47.662 --> 01:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
you feel like, I
don't belong here,

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.030 align:middle line:84%
these people are all way
better than me, or something.

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And so someone smarter
than me told me, man, you

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
got to tell yourself, no,
you deserve to be here.

01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:04.940 align:middle line:90%
You know you are worthy.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:05.740 align:middle line:90%
You do belong.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.980 align:middle line:90%


01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.170 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.170 align:middle line:90%
So I do some of that kind of--

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't look in the
mirror and do it,

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.725 align:middle line:84%
but I just talk to
myself sometimes.

01:06:17.725 --> 01:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's out loud and
sometimes it's just in my head,

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:21.558 align:middle line:90%
just thinking those thoughts.

01:06:21.558 --> 01:06:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's amazing how
quickly my attitude will--

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:27.290 align:middle line:84%
it will literally
change my attitude

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and my emotions just
instantaneously,

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.470 align:middle line:90%
when I just make--

01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:34.750 align:middle line:84%
no, like-- I start to
feel anxious or worried.

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:middle line:90%
What if I can't do it?

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just be
like, no, I'm smart.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm capable.

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:39.890 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:41.510 align:middle line:90%
I can figure this out.

01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And then all the sudden, I
have a boost of confidence.

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:46.480 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.440 align:middle line:90%
It's so dumb, but it works.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.620 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful thing
is truth is simple.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.680 align:middle line:90%
It is.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Lies are complicated.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And the simplest things
that people scoff at

01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:01.850 align:middle line:84%
are some of the most
powerful things we can do.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:05.189 align:middle line:90%

01:07:05.189 --> 01:07:09.490 align:middle line:90%


01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I've thought a lot
about the question

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.790 align:middle line:84%
of, how do you
define success, which

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:20.620 align:middle line:84%
ties into also
fulfillment, and probably

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
because Tim Ferriss asks every
person on his podcast, who's

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
the most successful person
you know, or something.

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And my answer to that would
be different than most.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not like, oh,
Steve Jobs or something.

01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:43.480 align:middle line:84%
To me, success is
leading a fulfilled life.

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And the way you define
a fulfilled life

01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:47.740 align:middle line:90%
is different for every person.

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But what I believe is
that you're not going

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:54.220 align:middle line:90%
to get fulfillment from stuff.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't get
fulfillment from money.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.570 align:middle line:90%
You don't get it from fame.

01:07:58.570 --> 01:08:03.400 align:middle line:84%
You don't get it from business
accolades and recognition.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't get it from
material possessions.

01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But the way the world measures
success, it's all those things.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.580 align:middle line:90%
All those things equal success.

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:16.779 align:middle line:84%
But we have thousands
and thousands

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:22.345 align:middle line:84%
of successful people with really
serious personal problems.

01:08:22.345 --> 01:08:26.319 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.899 align:middle line:84%
Look at how many
people in Hollywood

01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:31.510 align:middle line:84%
are rich and successful,
and yet they're

01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:33.160 align:middle line:90%
drug and alcohol addicts.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.450 align:middle line:90%
Their family lives are terrible.

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
They just go through one bad
relationship after another.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in a success
mindset and trap early on.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And cancer totally
reset my perspective.

01:08:52.270 --> 01:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It gave me this
profound appreciation

01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:00.310 align:middle line:90%
for the littlest things.

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:05.649 align:middle line:84%
And so I just started
to realize how much I

01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:08.979 align:middle line:84%
had to be grateful
for and thankful for.

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And I started comparing myself
to people that had nothing

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:15.310 align:middle line:90%
and realizing, I have so much.

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:17.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm rich.

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:23.680 align:middle line:84%
I am a rich man, to be born in
the United States of America.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm born rich.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:27.220 align:middle line:90%


01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Some of the poorest
people in the US

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
have houses, cars,
smartphones, cable television,

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:41.590 align:middle line:90%
and an unlimited supply of food.

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:44.979 align:middle line:84%
That's what we call
poor in the US.

01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:50.069 align:middle line:84%
And that is rich to
people in Nicaragua,

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:53.938 align:middle line:84%
in Cambodia in
most of China, that

01:09:53.938 --> 01:09:55.230 align:middle line:90%
don't have any of those things.

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't have TV, smartphones,
cars, and their houses are--

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't even
call it a house.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:06.610 align:middle line:84%
We'd call it just a shack or a
shanty or whatever, a lean-to.

01:10:06.610 --> 01:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And I just realized
that I'm so blessed,

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.070 align:middle line:90%
to the point of being spoiled.

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And most of us in Western
countries, we're just spoiled.

01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And the more you have,
the more you want.

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can never be
fulfilled by stuff.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to
fall in the trap

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
of wanting more stuff,
more money, more whatever.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And sure, there is a
certain amount of money

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
that can afford you to
do things like travel

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and live in a safe
neighborhood versus

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:38.200 align:middle line:90%
a dangerous neighborhood.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.850 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm not against money.

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad I was able to move my
family into a safe neighborhood

01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:47.753 align:middle line:84%
where my kids can
ride their bikes.

01:10:47.753 --> 01:10:49.420 align:middle line:84%
We're not worried
about them getting hit

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.730 align:middle line:90%
by a car or abducted.

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But to me, I just found
fulfillment in life.

01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Just being alive gave me
so much happiness and joy.

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Waking up in the morning
alive, without pain,

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and with all of my physical body
working, was like, this is--

01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:13.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm so thankful.

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, God, for
another day, for my wife

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
beside me, for my little baby,
and now for my two girls later.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.660 align:middle line:90%
But at that time, it was like--

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and that we have enough
money to get groceries and--

01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
at that time, we were
just barely getting

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:37.850 align:middle line:90%
by with our finances.

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:40.600 align:middle line:90%
But I was just so--

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:44.110 align:middle line:90%
I realized I was content.

01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So I think contentment
and fulfillment

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.490 align:middle line:90%
are two sides of the same coin.

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I learned-- cancer taught
me gratitude and contentment,

01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
two things I'd never
understood before.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, if
we never move from

01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
this first little
two-bedroom house we live in,

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:02.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm content with this.

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:04.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm just happy to be alive.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So everything else is
a bonus at this point.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm not dying.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm alive.

01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little bit
of a unique case

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:23.280 align:middle line:84%
because I had such a
dramatic karate chop, that--

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:29.970 align:middle line:84%
cancer has a way of
making this dividing line

01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
in your life between
the essential

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:33.540 align:middle line:90%
and the non-essential.

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.810 align:middle line:90%
And you realize right away--

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
maybe some cancer
patients don't.

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
For me, right away, I realized
this much was essential

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and this much was not essential.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It was like, my wife my family,
my health, roof over my head,

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
food, what we call the
basic human necessities,

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Maslow's hierarchy of needs--

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.010 align:middle line:90%
my needs are met.

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.660 align:middle line:90%
I've got the essentials.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
doesn't even matter.

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.438 align:middle line:90%
And if I have some of it, great.

01:13:08.438 --> 01:13:09.730 align:middle line:90%
It'd be fun to have more money.

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It'd be fun to be able to
go on a cruise or whatever.

01:13:12.690 --> 01:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
But man, I've got so much to
be thankful for every day.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, everything was
so hyper-clear to me.

01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I just had hyperclarity
in that time in my life

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that it just basically
rewired my brain.

01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It rewired my level of
contentment and gratitude.

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And it dropped the bar
way down, way down.

01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And so now I'm 13 years out
and I'm still about the same.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
There are days when
I can definitely

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.660 align:middle line:84%
get grumpy and
irritated and annoyed

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.020 align:middle line:90%
at things that don't matter.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have to catch
myself and be like,

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.100 align:middle line:90%
why am I upset about this?

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.150 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

01:14:03.150 --> 01:14:04.860 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.120 align:middle line:90%
It's irritating.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's forget about it.

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:12.000 align:middle line:90%
And so I think--

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I try to help people
understand this.

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I try to remind people
of this, and especially

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.070 align:middle line:90%
cancer patients, that--

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:19.112 align:middle line:84%
I think they're easier
because they understand it

01:14:19.112 --> 01:14:22.658 align:middle line:84%
because they have that same
hyperclarity about what's

01:14:22.658 --> 01:14:23.700 align:middle line:90%
important and what's not.

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:28.243 align:middle line:84%
But if you really take
stock in your life

01:14:28.243 --> 01:14:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and you really look
at what's around you

01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and what you really care
about and what you absolutely

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.850 align:middle line:84%
have to have and what all
you don't have to have

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and what you need to be
happy, it's very little.

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And the happiest people in
the world are the poorest.

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
There's multiple studies they've
done on the happiest people

01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:44.750 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And you Google it, it's
always the poorest cultures

01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.940 align:middle line:90%
that are so happy.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, how
can they be so happy?

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:52.500 align:middle line:90%
They have nothing.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
have nothing, it

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.020 align:middle line:84%
teaches you to be
grateful for everything.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can learn a lot
from people like that.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.920 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.760 align:middle line:90%


01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It's been 13 years
since I was diagnosed.

01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:14.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm still cancer-free.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:18.250 align:middle line:84%
The original oncologist
that told me I was insane,

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen him
again, never went back.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But I found an
integrative oncologist

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
who is an amazing man that had
come back out of retirement

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to treat cancer patients
and was actually doing

01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
a vitamin and C IV therapy
and some other integrative

01:15:32.230 --> 01:15:36.072 align:middle line:84%
or "alternative" nontoxic
therapies because he had spent

01:15:36.072 --> 01:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
a lifetime watching
people suffer and die

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:39.510 align:middle line:90%
with conventional treatment.

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was in his 70s and he's
like, let's try something else.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's try some other things
that are nontoxic, maybe that

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.840 align:middle line:90%
can boost the immune system.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.910 align:middle line:90%
And maybe we can help.

01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can help people get
well with some new things.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It ended up costing
him his license,

01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
but it didn't matter
because he was in his 70s.

01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It was fine.

01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:01.909 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:08.208 align:middle line:90%
My name's Chris Wark.

01:16:08.208 --> 01:16:10.000 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
stage III colon cancer

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.010 align:middle line:90%
when I was 26 years old.

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And after surgery, I
refused chemotherapy.

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And I did a very scary
thing, which was I

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
chose to try to get well, to
try to heal, with nutrition

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and natural therapies
because the idea of poisoning

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.490 align:middle line:84%
my way back to health
didn't make sense.

01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:31.330 align:middle line:84%
But this idea that I
could rebuild my body

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
if I changed my whole diet and
life, that maybe my body could

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.530 align:middle line:84%
heal, that maybe the reason I
was sick was because of the way

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I was living, maybe it
was partly my fault,

01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:43.790 align:middle line:90%
and I was OK with that--

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and so the idea that if I
changed everything, maybe

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.700 align:middle line:90%
I could get well.

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And so I stepped out in faith.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
I did something that was scary,
but made a little more sense

01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:05.530 align:middle line:84%
to me than the traditional
chemotherapy track.

01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:08.500 align:middle line:90%
And I did get well.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I
started a family.

01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I have two girls that are
8 and 11 years old now.

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 39.

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And I've been eating
massive amounts

01:17:18.370 --> 01:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
of fruits and vegetables every
day for the last 13 years.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And people still routinely
ask me if I'm in my 20s.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's as if I almost
haven't aged in 13 years.

01:17:32.710 --> 01:17:33.880 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty crazy.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
power of my choices

01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:39.280 align:middle line:84%
not just to change my diet to
a plant-based diet with loads

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
of fruits and
vegetables, but also, I

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.980 align:middle line:90%
changed the way I thought.

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I changed my
attitude, my emotions.

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I started to choose positivity.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.960 align:middle line:90%
I chose gratitude.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.830 align:middle line:84%
I stopped being bitter and
envy and jealous of people.

01:17:53.830 --> 01:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I'm so
blessed to have what I have.

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And so contentment and
gratitude became a big part

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
of my daily practice.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And all of those things
created health in my body.

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I sit here
now, 13 years later,

01:18:15.130 --> 01:18:19.150 align:middle line:84%
in the best shape of my life,
in the best health of my life.

01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Dr. McCullough
told me last night

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.923 align:middle line:84%
that I looked
extraordinarily healthy

01:18:23.923 --> 01:18:25.930 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said to me.

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:28.361 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

01:18:28.361 --> 01:18:31.798 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:18:31.798 --> 01:18:35.740 align:middle line:90%


01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the big things I did
was a radical diet change.

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I took massive
action and converted

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
from the standard
Western diet, which

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
is meat and dairy three
times a day, processed food,

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
fast food, junk
food, tons of sugar,

01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:57.400 align:middle line:84%
salt, oils, just your
standard Western diet,

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and I converted to
a raw vegan diet

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
after reading a book by a
guy who healed his cancer

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.320 align:middle line:90%
with this raw vegan diet.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm like, wow,
this is interesting.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.620 align:middle line:90%
I want to try this.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And it made sense to me
or I least liked the idea

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:21.790 align:middle line:84%
that maybe I was sick in part
because my body was deficient,

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:24.790 align:middle line:84%
like I wasn't giving it
all the nutrition it really

01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:26.740 align:middle line:90%
needed to thrive.

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I read a book that
made a case for, we're

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.850 align:middle line:84%
missing a lot of vital
nutrients from our diet

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:35.725 align:middle line:84%
because we're eating
all this processed food.

01:19:35.725 --> 01:19:37.975 align:middle line:84%
And if you start eating tons
of fruits and vegetables,

01:19:37.975 --> 01:19:40.270 align:middle line:84%
you're putting all this
amazing stuff in your body

01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to really
function at optimal levels.

01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's powerful
anticancer compounds

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:50.060 align:middle line:90%
in fruits and vegetables.

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So I convert this
raw vegan diet.

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was drinking
tons of carrot juice

01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.003 align:middle line:84%
because I'd read that carrot
juice is really good for cancer

01:20:00.003 --> 01:20:02.170 align:middle line:84%
because it has a lot of
vitamin A and beta carotene.

01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So I was taking 64 ounces
of carrot juice every day.

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd make a big batch first
thing in the morning.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.800 align:middle line:90%
And then for lunch--

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:09.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm a minimalist.

01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And so in the beginning, I got a
raw food cookbook and I'm like,

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll make some
recipes and stuff.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And then I quickly realized
that it was too much work,

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, I got to
buy a dehydrator

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and then make these dehydrated,
raw crackers or something.

01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:26.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:28.160 align:middle line:90%
It got really complicated.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized that if
I was going to do this,

01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I had to simplify
it down to something

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.840 align:middle line:84%
that I could do
every single day.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.778 align:middle line:84%
It had to be doable
and sustainable.

01:20:39.778 --> 01:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't be like
you get on a kick

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and then lose interest
because it's too much work.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So I came to this
very simple conclusion

01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:52.060 align:middle line:84%
that, all right, let me just
get every vegetable I can find

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and just put them
in a giant bowl

01:20:54.190 --> 01:20:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and have a giant salad,
giant cancer-fighting salad.

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't just a
big bowl of lettuce,

01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:03.492 align:middle line:84%
which is what people think about
when they think about salad,

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:04.540 align:middle line:90%
usually.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there were leafy grains
like spinach and kale,

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
but it was broccoli,
cauliflower, kale, cabbage,

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.120 align:middle line:84%
onions, mushrooms, peppers,
sprouts, not only broccoli

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
sprouts, but also sprouted
garbanzo beans or mung beans

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:21.910 align:middle line:90%
or lentils.

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I would top it
with a little Bragg--

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
organic olive oil and apple
cider vinegar, fermented--

01:21:29.710 --> 01:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
obviously, vinegar is fermented,
but also some sauerkraut

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:34.060 align:middle line:90%
or kimchi on there.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I would add some spices
like garlic, turmeric, oregano,

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.930 align:middle line:90%
and cayenne pepper.

01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I just made
this giant salad.

01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:48.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I had to go buy bigger
bowls because we didn't even

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.380 align:middle line:84%
have bowls big enough
for this monster salad

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
that I just figured,
OK, well these

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
are all the best anticancer
vegetables, so I've "read".

01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I guess I just need to
eat a lot of these every single

01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:59.510 align:middle line:90%
day.

01:21:59.510 --> 01:22:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I just created this
very simple daily diet.

01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It was juicing
throughout the day--

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I pretty much juiced
through breakfast--

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and then giant salad
for lunch and dinner.

01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was so delicious.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I loved it so much that it
was just really easy to eat.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It was just so good.

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And then as time went on and
I read and research more,

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I started to find actual
nutritional science

01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:26.900 align:middle line:84%
published research on the
most potent anticancer foods.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
science on this now.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And in 2004, I didn't
even know about any of it.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I was just reading
people's opinions

01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
in books that were not
scientists, survivors

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:37.840 align:middle line:90%
and healers and stuff.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And turns out the most
potent anticancer vegetables

01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:47.650 align:middle line:84%
are garlic, onions, leeks,
broccoli, cauliflower, kale,

01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:48.880 align:middle line:90%
cabbage.

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything I was
eating had a variety

01:22:52.510 --> 01:22:55.270 align:middle line:90%
of anticancer compounds.

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.670 align:middle line:84%
My juice had carrot juice,
but it also had ginger in it,

01:22:57.670 --> 01:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
which ginger is a very
potent anticancer compound.

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I was using these spices,
garlic, turmeric, oregano, and

01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
cayenne pepper, which are
all potent anticancer spices.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was this
perfect synergistic--

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I call it the giant
cancer-fighting salad

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
because there is no
way you can really

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:21.730 align:middle line:84%
calculate how much
potency is in it with all

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:24.700 align:middle line:84%
of these vegetables in
there and the spices.

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:28.810 align:middle line:90%
And so that was my concoction.

01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And those two giant salads plus
juicing throughout the day--

01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:38.000 align:middle line:84%
plus, in the afternoons, I
would have a fruit smoothie.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I would get a fresh, young
coconut, cut it open,

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.700 align:middle line:84%
pour the juice in the blender
and scoop the meat out and put

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:45.075 align:middle line:84%
that in the blender,
blend it up,

01:23:45.075 --> 01:23:47.030 align:middle line:84%
make a "coconut
milk" or whatever,

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and then throw a few cups of
frozen organic berries in there

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.070 align:middle line:90%
and a banana.

01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:54.905 align:middle line:84%
So berries are the most
potent anticancer fruits.

01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:57.420 align:middle line:90%


01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.032 align:middle line:90%
And so I was doing that, too.

01:23:59.032 --> 01:24:00.240 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it at the time.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But again, I'd
read a few things.

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I'm going
to make a berry smoothie.

01:24:03.650 --> 01:24:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'd read coconuts
were pretty good.

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I went from eating
one to two servings of fruits

01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:16.370 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables per day just--

01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
if you're counting
French fries and a tomato

01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:22.040 align:middle line:90%
slice on a hamburger.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.938 align:middle line:90%
Does that count as a vegetable?

01:24:23.938 --> 01:24:24.980 align:middle line:90%
It's technically a fruit.

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:25.813 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows that.

01:24:25.813 --> 01:24:27.230 align:middle line:90%
But you know what I'm saying.

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I went from that to
between 15 and 20 servings

01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of fruits and vegetables every
single day, day in, day out.

01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was 100%.

01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:39.260 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just like,
oh, I'll have a salad

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
and then tonight, I'll
have a cheeseburger.

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:45.733 align:middle line:84%
It was day in, day out, every
day, every day, every day.

01:24:45.733 --> 01:24:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I did
some juice fasting.

01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So I would go for 3, 5,
7, 10 days on just juice,

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.810 align:middle line:84%
just trying to detoxify
and cleanse my body

01:24:53.810 --> 01:25:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and just do something radical
and see what would happen.

01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out, when you
eat 15 to 20 servings of fruits

01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables every day,
your body really likes it

01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And really amazing
things start happening.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.910 align:middle line:84%
You're saturating your body
with all kinds of vitamins,

01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:22.550 align:middle line:84%
minerals, enzymes, and thousands
of anticancer compounds,

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
phytonutrients, phytochemicals,
which means basically

01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:29.270 align:middle line:84%
plant nutrients, that you
don't find in meat and dairy

01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:31.220 align:middle line:90%
and Snickers bars.

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:34.232 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
synergistic effect.

01:25:34.232 --> 01:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
When you're just putting
all this stuff in every day,

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.840 align:middle line:90%
you get momentum.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And you get this healing
momentum and this nutrition

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.267 align:middle line:84%
momentum, where you
just keep giving

01:25:44.267 --> 01:25:45.350 align:middle line:90%
your body this good stuff.

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh,
wow, man, we've

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.707 align:middle line:84%
got all these really
good raw materials.

01:25:48.707 --> 01:25:52.750 align:middle line:84%
We can really do
some stuff with this.

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the process, I was
feeling tons of energy.

01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, I had a
little bit of a detox reaction.

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.170 align:middle line:84%
The first week, felt low
energy and didn't feel so good

01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and was detoxing
from food withdrawal,

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.280 align:middle line:84%
from the meat and dairy
and sugar-addicted diet

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.390 align:middle line:90%
that I was on.

01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But once that addiction
broke, then I just

01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
had this amazing turnaround
in my energy levels.

01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And life was good.

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:27.050 align:middle line:90%
I was just feeling great.

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I drank so much carrot juice
I turned orange, orange skin,

01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:34.178 align:middle line:90%
orange hands.

01:26:34.178 --> 01:26:35.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember at a
doctor's appointment,

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:41.320 align:middle line:84%
the nurse said, you look
like you might be jaundiced.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no, no,
it's just the carrots.

01:26:43.330 --> 01:26:44.360 align:middle line:90%
I drink a lot of carrot juice.

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.335 align:middle line:84%
And she said well, maybe
you're drinking too much.

01:26:46.335 --> 01:26:47.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I'm all right.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:47.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.875 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

01:26:48.875 --> 01:26:50.458 align:middle line:84%
Let me just keep
doing what I'm doing.

01:26:50.458 --> 01:26:53.874 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:26:53.874 --> 01:26:58.270 align:middle line:90%


01:26:58.270 --> 01:27:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So my diet has
evolved over time.

01:27:03.230 --> 01:27:07.390 align:middle line:84%
The first 90 days of
my anticancer journey

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:09.580 align:middle line:90%
were 100% raw.

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And around that 90-day mark,
working with an oncologist,

01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:18.760 align:middle line:84%
he suggested that I add some
cooked food into the diet

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.030 align:middle line:90%
and some animal protein.

01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:24.881 align:middle line:84%
And the reason he did
is because even though I

01:27:24.881 --> 01:27:27.410 align:middle line:84%
was feeling really
good, was underweight,

01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:28.630 align:middle line:90%
was really, really thin.

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:30.075 align:middle line:90%
I'd lost weight from cancer.

01:27:30.075 --> 01:27:31.450 align:middle line:84%
I'd lost weight
from the surgery.

01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I'd done juice fasting,
lost more weight.

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:35.122 align:middle line:90%
So I was really skinny.

01:27:35.122 --> 01:27:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And I had a really
high metabolism.

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I was just not
gaining weight back.

01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, why don't
we add more cooked food?

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you add some brown
rice and sweet potatoes

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.530 align:middle line:90%
and quinoa with your dinner?

01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And why don't you try to have a
serving of clean animal protein

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.790 align:middle line:84%
maybe once or twice a week,
like wild-caught salmon

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:58.840 align:middle line:84%
or organic, grass-fed lamb
or something like that?

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason he
recommend lamb is

01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:04.780 align:middle line:84%
because lamb is one of the
only meats that doesn't

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.280 align:middle line:90%
have fear hormones in it.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Because lambs, they don't
resist being slaughtered,

01:28:10.810 --> 01:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
which is actually why Jesus
is called the Lamb of God,

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't resist
going to the cross,

01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:18.160 align:middle line:90%
being slaughtered.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It just blew my mind when
my naturopath told me that.

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:23.590 align:middle line:90%
I was like wow, man.

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So at that point,
I thought, well--

01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I assumed I'd be a raw
vegan the rest of my life.

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I was fully indoctrinated.

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I was in the most elite club
of healthy eating possible.

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually starting
to turn into a little bit

01:28:41.230 --> 01:28:43.865 align:middle line:90%
of a snob about it.

01:28:43.865 --> 01:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
I wanted to live.

01:28:45.490 --> 01:28:48.430 align:middle line:90%


01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And I trusted this man
that was helping me.

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, well-- and
I knew I was way underweight.

01:28:54.190 --> 01:28:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I looked in the mirror and
I didn't like what I saw.

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK,
I just want to live.

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.880 align:middle line:84%
If you think it's
OK, I'll try it.

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So we added a little
more cooked food,

01:29:02.710 --> 01:29:04.300 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of animal protein.

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to get back
up to a normal weight range

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and maintain that
diet for years.

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So that was the diet
that for many years

01:29:14.770 --> 01:29:18.248 align:middle line:84%
was my anticancer diet, giant
salads, juicing all day,

01:29:18.248 --> 01:29:20.290 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of cooked
food in my salad at night,

01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
and occasional serving
of animal protein.

01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:26.230 align:middle line:90%
And now it's been 13 years.

01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And once I got past
the five-year mark,

01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I started experimenting
with different diets.

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.925 align:middle line:84%
The paleo diet was
getting popular

01:29:33.925 --> 01:29:35.590 align:middle line:90%
and I was interested in it.

01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Experimented with
that a little bit.

01:29:37.090 --> 01:29:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Experimented with Weston
Price and the raw milk

01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and raw eggs, raw butter,
and the other side

01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:44.860 align:middle line:84%
of raw food eating,
except I never

01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:46.870 align:middle line:90%
got into the raw meat eating.

01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But I started investigating
a lot of different diets

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and became obsessed
with healthy cultures

01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and healthy populations.

01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that there
are a lot of gurus promoting

01:29:57.070 --> 01:30:02.530 align:middle line:84%
healthy diets, but a lot
of their healthy diet ideas

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:05.800 align:middle line:84%
were not grounded
in real people.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.800 align:middle line:84%
They were just
grounded in theory.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the deeper
I dug and the more

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I started to read and research,
I realized, wait a minute.

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:21.730 align:middle line:84%
We've got healthy, long-living
cultures around the world

01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:24.400 align:middle line:90%
already, established.

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.747 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

01:30:26.747 --> 01:30:27.580 align:middle line:90%
How are they eating?

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:28.480 align:middle line:90%
How are they living?

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.897 align:middle line:84%
And then I found
this amazing book

01:30:29.897 --> 01:30:32.080 align:middle line:84%
called "The Blue Zones,"
which is all about that,

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and another book by John
Robbins, "Healthy at 100."

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And so those books were really
great because again, they--

01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:41.410 align:middle line:84%
"The Blue Zones" is a
National Geographic project.

01:30:41.410 --> 01:30:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And they travel the world
and they found these isolated

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:47.440 align:middle line:84%
pockets where they had really
high percentages of people

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.300 align:middle line:90%
living past 100.

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:54.058 align:middle line:84%
And they studied their
diet and lifestyle habits.

01:30:54.058 --> 01:30:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And they realized, wow,
there's a lot of common threads

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:57.790 align:middle line:84%
all over the world with
these people groups

01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:59.623 align:middle line:84%
even though they're on
different continents.

01:30:59.623 --> 01:31:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Their diet's 95% plant-based.

01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:03.860 align:middle line:90%
So they're not vegans.

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:05.740 align:middle line:90%
They're not raw vegans.

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.930 align:middle line:84%
But their diet is almost
exclusively plants.

01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They might eat meat a few times
a week, a few times a month,

01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.700 align:middle line:90%
but it's very low.

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And they have really
good community support.

01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And they typically get a lot
of fresh air and sunshine

01:31:17.650 --> 01:31:19.775 align:middle line:84%
because they're poor and
they're walking everywhere

01:31:19.775 --> 01:31:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and they're working outside.

01:31:21.130 --> 01:31:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
community support,

01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:28.330 align:middle line:84%
they have good, really
strong social structure,

01:31:28.330 --> 01:31:31.090 align:middle line:84%
big, extended families, and
they spend a lot of time

01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:33.070 align:middle line:90%
together as a community.

01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And so then I started to read
the science and the studies

01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:41.610 align:middle line:90%
behind those books.

01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:44.705 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, OK,
I now understand.

01:31:44.705 --> 01:31:46.330 align:middle line:84%
These are the people
I want to emulate.

01:31:46.330 --> 01:31:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
emulate the guru who

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
has some caveman theory
of our healthiest diet,

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
eat like a caveman.

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to emulate the
healthiest people on Earth

01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:01.860 align:middle line:84%
now, that are real,
that we can study,

01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have to
speculate anything about.

01:32:04.290 --> 01:32:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And so that brought
me full circle

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.170 align:middle line:84%
from experimenting
with different things

01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and eating a lot more meat
than I had been eating

01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:14.820 align:middle line:90%
when I had cancer and things.

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
yeah, you know what?

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
My initial cancer diet
was right on the money.

01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But with my metabolism, I just
need a little more cooked food

01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:23.250 align:middle line:90%
versus raw.

01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So my diet now is
about 98% plant-based.

01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And I eat one raw meal a
day and two cooked meals.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And I basically eat the
same stuff every day.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm a minimalist.

01:32:36.810 --> 01:32:38.685 align:middle line:84%
Breakfast is a giant
bowl of oatmeal

01:32:38.685 --> 01:32:41.760 align:middle line:84%
with tons of fruit in it and
hemp seed, flaxseed, chia seed,

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.570 align:middle line:90%
cinnamon, lots of good stuff.

01:32:43.570 --> 01:32:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Lunch is a huge smoothie, lots
of fruit, 4 cups of berries,

01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:51.600 align:middle line:84%
10 dates, handfuls of spinach
and kale, almonds, walnuts.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And then dinner is
something my wife makes.

01:32:54.930 --> 01:32:56.410 align:middle line:90%
So dinner, we mix it up.

01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So she'll make--
one example that we

01:32:58.930 --> 01:33:00.660 align:middle line:84%
have [INAUDIBLE]
on regular rotation

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:06.420 align:middle line:84%
would be sweet potato,
black bean quesadillas.

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So it'd be an organic
sprouted tortilla and then

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:16.110 align:middle line:84%
sweet potatoes and black beans
and lentils and some avocado

01:33:16.110 --> 01:33:18.660 align:middle line:84%
and cilantro and a
little salsa in there.

01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And it's delicious.

01:33:20.370 --> 01:33:23.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just so good, my mouth is
watering just talking about it.

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, she'll just make
a variety of cooked veggies

01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.870 align:middle line:90%
for dinner.

01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And once or twice a month, if
I have a craving for animal

01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:31.980 align:middle line:90%
protein, I'll have some.

01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
different than back

01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:36.660 align:middle line:84%
when I used to eat
meat every day.

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I hear people
say, oh, I just

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:39.990 align:middle line:90%
couldn't live without meat.

01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:42.460 align:middle line:84%
I have to have
meat with my meal.

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that state,
you have a protein addiction.

01:33:48.190 --> 01:33:49.830 align:middle line:84%
You have an animal
protein addiction.

01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Your body is adapted to eating
animal protein, this really

01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:56.460 align:middle line:84%
concentrated protein,
three times a day.

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, if you stop
doing it, in the short term,

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.390 align:middle line:90%
you feel like crap.

01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:02.770 align:middle line:90%
You have withdrawal from it.

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But once you break
that addiction,

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:08.250 align:middle line:84%
if you have a craving for
it, it feels very different.

01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's not every day and it
may not even be every week.

01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:13.040 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's every
maybe few weeks,

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I might feel like I
need a little bit.

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:18.907 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing is seeing
all these healthy cultures

01:34:18.907 --> 01:34:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and the way that eat, that's
basically the way they eat,

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:22.270 align:middle line:90%
too.

01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:23.947 align:middle line:90%
So I feel good about it.

01:34:23.947 --> 01:34:24.747 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:34:24.747 --> 01:34:28.086 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:34:28.086 --> 01:34:30.950 align:middle line:90%


01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:32.365 align:middle line:90%
Well, spiritual mantra?

01:34:32.365 --> 01:34:34.960 align:middle line:90%


01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm a pretty minimal,
simple kind of guy.

01:34:38.710 --> 01:34:40.930 align:middle line:90%
And I believe truth is simple.

01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, I believe that
God created the Earth for us

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and that everything we
need comes from the earth.

01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was that very
simple idea that

01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:58.090 align:middle line:84%
was the foundation of me
adopting this hardcore

01:34:58.090 --> 01:35:02.200 align:middle line:84%
diet of fruits and vegetables,
food from the earth.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.970 align:middle line:90%
It just made sense to me.

01:35:03.970 --> 01:35:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It was like, I think
truth is simple

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to do this.

01:35:08.290 --> 01:35:11.490 align:middle line:90%


01:35:11.490 --> 01:35:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot
of fear in my journey.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And it required me to go
very deep in my faith.

01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:20.800 align:middle line:90%
It was a test of my faith.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Because faith is
believing in something

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
physical evidence of.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was believing
that when I asked God for help

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and I got an answer, that it
was from him, and that if it was

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:43.330 align:middle line:84%
from him, that if I took this
very different path, that he

01:35:43.330 --> 01:35:45.280 align:middle line:90%
would see me through it.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a daily struggle
to fight doubt and fear.

01:35:53.890 --> 01:35:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can be in fear and
in faith at the same time.

01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:03.220 align:middle line:84%
You can be also fearful,
but moving forward in faith.

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:05.410 align:middle line:90%
But doubt is the enemy of faith.

01:36:05.410 --> 01:36:06.460 align:middle line:90%
You can't have both.

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:07.930 align:middle line:90%
They cannot both exist.

01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So fighting doubt was a
big part of my daily--

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.810 align:middle line:90%
because doubts creep in.

01:36:12.810 --> 01:36:15.775 align:middle line:84%
And I would just have to catch
myself and be like, I'm just

01:36:15.775 --> 01:36:16.900 align:middle line:90%
going to choose to believe.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.970 align:middle line:90%
God, I trust you.

01:36:18.970 --> 01:36:20.770 align:middle line:90%
You're in control.

01:36:20.770 --> 01:36:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Please don't let me die.

01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
everything I can do.

01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing everything I can do.

01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, I know you're--

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm choosing to believe
that you're in control.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I know in my heart, deep down,
you're in control of this.

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:38.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm trusting you.

01:36:38.290 --> 01:36:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Because there were many moments
where I just had this thought--

01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd be my car or
something and I'd

01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:49.407 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit
overwhelmed with fear.

01:36:49.407 --> 01:36:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'd just be like, it's
just you and me, Jesus.

01:36:51.490 --> 01:36:52.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what else to do.

01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't have anybody else.

01:36:54.580 --> 01:36:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And so it was just me and Jesus.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:00.460 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:01.900 align:middle line:90%
It was all I had.

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
As much as my mom loves
me and supported me,

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.090 align:middle line:84%
and of course my wife ended
up becoming a big support,

01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:10.810 align:middle line:84%
you're still very alone
in the cancer journey.

01:37:10.810 --> 01:37:13.870 align:middle line:84%
It's you and your thoughts and
your life and your decisions

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:16.600 align:middle line:90%
and your future.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it pushed me
very deep into faith.

01:37:21.190 --> 01:37:22.657 align:middle line:90%
I was already a believer.

01:37:22.657 --> 01:37:23.740 align:middle line:90%
I was already a Christian.

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was like, OK, I really
got to go deep, deep, and trust

01:37:31.210 --> 01:37:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that God is in control and
that if I put my faith in him,

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:36.040 align:middle line:90%
that he won't let me down.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.300 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't.

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And what I encourage
people to do--

01:37:41.290 --> 01:37:43.270 align:middle line:84%
if they don't believe
there's a God--

01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and I think when you have
cancer, you're much more open.

01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:49.520 align:middle line:84%
You're confronted
with death and so--

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.060 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't believe or you
don't know or your not sure,

01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:53.490 align:middle line:90%
just reach out.

01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:55.180 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:58.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
to church tomorrow.

01:37:58.270 --> 01:38:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Just reach out and
ask, are you there?

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Reveal yourself.

01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:04.520 align:middle line:90%
I need help.

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm-- just a sincere
prayer, like, OK,

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:11.850 align:middle line:90%
you've got my attention.

01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:14.560 align:middle line:90%
Just speak to me.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Show me people in my life--

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, amazing
things happen, when you ask.

01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
to be willing--

01:38:24.730 --> 01:38:28.570 align:middle line:84%
you have to put your
little antenna up.

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't just say--

01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:33.100 align:middle line:84%
God never really answers
prayer-- usually,

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:39.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not just like, can I have
a pony, blip, like, oh, hey.

01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:40.990 align:middle line:90%
He uses people.

01:38:40.990 --> 01:38:42.320 align:middle line:90%
God works through people.

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
asking for help,

01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:48.460 align:middle line:84%
then you have to really
have your eyes open

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and be looking for the answer
to come to you, and then

01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:53.560 align:middle line:90%
not just--

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.977 align:middle line:84%
if something comes,
you can't just

01:38:54.977 --> 01:38:56.980 align:middle line:84%
be like, oh, it's
just a coincidence,

01:38:56.980 --> 01:38:58.090 align:middle line:90%
and then throw it out.

01:38:58.090 --> 01:39:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you just totally
hijacked maybe a huge blessing.

01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:05.900 align:middle line:84%
If that book had come to
me and I'd just been like,

01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:11.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, who knows what
my life would have been like?

01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Or if I had let the
doubt overtake my faith--

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.340 align:middle line:84%
because people
were pushing doubt.

01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:21.050 align:middle line:84%
They were really feeding this
doubt, like, don't do this.

01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:21.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a mistake.

01:39:21.850 --> 01:39:23.530 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't work.

01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Got to do what the doctor says.

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And if I had really let
the doubt take over,

01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:33.120 align:middle line:90%
then I'd probably be dead.

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have my
beautiful girls.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.115 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what
would have happened?

01:39:38.115 --> 01:39:40.890 align:middle line:84%
But that's where the rubber
meets the road because--

01:39:40.890 --> 01:39:42.720 align:middle line:90%
there's a verse in James.

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And it says faith
without works is dead.

01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:49.050 align:middle line:90%
And works means action.

01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And so you prove your
faith by your actions,

01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:56.640 align:middle line:84%
like I believe this, therefore
I'm doing something about it,

01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.792 align:middle line:84%
like, I believe this
chair will hold me up;

01:40:00.792 --> 01:40:02.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to put
my weight on it.

01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:08.970 align:middle line:90%


01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:10.980 align:middle line:84%
People get confused
about what faith is.

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:12.627 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
believing something.

01:40:12.627 --> 01:40:14.460 align:middle line:84%
It's believing something
so much that you're

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:16.710 align:middle line:84%
willing to stake
your life on it.

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:22.500 align:middle line:84%
You're willing to take
action and with the hope

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that your action will produce
that thing that you have faith

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.160 align:middle line:90%
for.

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:29.510 align:middle line:90%
