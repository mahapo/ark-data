00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:14.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So growing up in
country Australia,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.140 align:middle line:84%
we had chickens in the backyard
and grew a lot of our own

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:84%
vegetables, and it was a
very, very simple life.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.262 align:middle line:84%
But I was really fortunate
that my parents would

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:84%
let me go and pick
the parsley for dinner

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and collect the eggs,
and the conversations

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:84%
they would have with me was
always around the nutritional

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:90%
value of food.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And it obviously
had an impact on me

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
because I grew up in the
era where fat was the enemy

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and carbohydrates were
everybody's friend,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and there was a huge influx of
processed food into the food

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:90%
supply.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.555 align:middle line:84%
But my parents-- those foods
never really were on offer,

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and they would always
explain to me the nutritional

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.570 align:middle line:84%
value of food, not about
the calories, where

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I felt like the magazines
and everyone else

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be talking about
calories and weight loss.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But I clearly remember Mom,
for example, saying to me,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
grab an orange off
the tray because it's

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.186 align:middle line:84%
a great source of
vitamin C, and vitamin C

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
is really good for
your immune system,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and that helps you
prevent colds and flu.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So from an early age, I
had a deep appreciation

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:84%
that food came from nature and
that we needed it to survive,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
but we also needed
it to be really well,

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
and it really fostered, I guess,
my interest from a really young

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.735 align:middle line:90%
age in nourishing food choices.

00:01:21.735 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a growing problem
for too many communities.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But education, I think, has
to be the first step in people

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
understanding the value of
making nutritious food choices.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
for that to happen,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
one of the first things
that we need to do

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:84%
is change the language
we use around food

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:90%
because food isn't healthy.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
It's humans are
healthy or they're not.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Food is nutritious or it isn't.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And so instead of
saying to people,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
you need to eat this
because it's healthy,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:84%
right now there's so much
confusion out there--

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.605 align:middle line:84%
whether people have access
to amazing fresh food or not.

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:84%
There's confusion
out there about

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:84%
whether low-fat cheese is
healthy or kale is healthy.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.025 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we bring the concept
back to will this nourish me,

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
if people could ask that
question before they

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
ate anything, and as
long as they mostly

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:84%
moved in the direction of
making nourishing choices,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it would help
people in certain communities

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:84%
request more of the
food service providers.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I also think that we make time
for whatever we prioritize.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So when people say to me,
I don't have time to cook,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.850 align:middle line:84%
what they're really saying
is cooking my dinner isn't

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.448 align:middle line:90%
a priority for me right now.

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to
say it how it really

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.770 align:middle line:84%
is and try that on and see if
we're comfortable with that.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So we do whatever we prioritize
and we do whatever we value.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we are in that situation
where it is a seemingly food

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
desert, we always find-- you
can find a way if it's something

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.320 align:middle line:90%
that you value.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's traveling
a distance to buy in bulk

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and coming home and then
freezing some of that food--

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.740 align:middle line:84%
a lot of nutrients aren't
actually destroyed in freezing.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
You could cook up big batches of
soups and stews and casseroles

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and have that there
and ready to go.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like there are ways
around people who struggle

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:90%
to get access to fresh produce.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I have immense empathy
for that, as well,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
an easy situation.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that we can make
our way when it's something

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:90%
that we value.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.618 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I'm working with
someone around their food,

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I come at it from a
three-pillar approach--

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.200 align:middle line:84%
the biochemical, the
nutritional, and the emotional.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So the emotional component,
part of that is helping people

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:84%
understand why they
do what they do

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.825 align:middle line:84%
even though they know
what they know, because

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people these
days, it's not actually

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
a lack of education that
leads them to polish off

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.628 align:middle line:84%
a packet of chocolate
biscuits after dinner.

00:03:51.628 --> 00:03:53.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people today
aren't doing that thinking,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feel so
fabulous after I smash these.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
It's often we don't
understand why we do it.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you can
answer the question

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
"food is," finish
the sentence, you'll

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
start to get an
insight about what

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:90%
food is really about for you.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And an athlete-- every time
you say that to an athlete,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
they finish it with
the word "fuel."

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.700 align:middle line:90%
It's there for performance.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:84%
It's there to enhance what
their body is capable of doing.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.920 align:middle line:84%
If you say it to
someone like me,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:84%
my answer is always
nourishment, and that's mostly

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:90%
in the physical realm.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's about vitamins and
minerals and antioxidants

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and all those good things
that only food can give us.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you ask someone
who eats emotionally

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to finish that sentence "food
is," nearly always there'll

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
be a highly emotive word at
the end of that sentence.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It might be "comfort"
or "pleasure" or "joy."

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you've
got it linked

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.310 align:middle line:84%
to a really strong
emotion, if you don't have

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
any other avenues to
experience that emotion,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
then regular over
eating or making

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
food choices that don't
support your health

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:84%
becomes a quick fix to
changing how we feel.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think we've got to
take it further these days

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
because they're definitely,
of course, has to be accurate

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:90%
education.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
People have to know
really what food is

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:90%
and what's in their food.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:84%
The information they receive
has got to be accurate.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
But I find that education
alone is not always

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.002 align:middle line:84%
enough to lead people
to behavioral change.

00:05:12.002 --> 00:05:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Getting insight into why
they do what they do is key.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
So my approach has three
pillars to it-- the biochemical,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
the nutritional,
and the emotional.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.833 align:middle line:84%
And I actually went to
uni for 14 years, which

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I know makes me
sound really thick

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and like I probably
failed everything,

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:84%
but I loved learning
very much and still do.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So I originally studied
nutrition and dietetics

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and then went on and did
a PhD in biochemistry--

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.930 align:middle line:84%
so a huge amount of science
back there in my learning.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's still the
foundation of what I share.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But when I was doing
that PhD in biochemistry,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I had all of the biochemical
pathways that go on

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.100 align:middle line:84%
inside the human
body, I had them all

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:84%
mapped out on great big
pieces of paper Blu Tack

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:90%
to my bedroom walls.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:84%
It was the only way I was
ever going to learn it.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you see the body
mapped out like that,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
you get the deepest appreciation
for the absolute miracle

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
But you also get the
deepest appreciation

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
for the critical role nutrients
play every moment of our lives.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So the way to understand
a biochemical reaction

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that essentially creates how
we feel, how we function,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:90%
how we look--

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
everything about us is
created by the billions

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
of reactions that go on
inside of us every second.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:90%
So let's just look at one.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.440 align:middle line:84%
One reaction might
be substance A

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is going to be converted
into substance B. That's

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:90%
one reaction.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Then B will become
C, C becomes D,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and on and on the
cascade of change goes.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But for substance A to
turn into substance B,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
you need nutrients to
fire that reaction.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you need
magnesium and vitamin B6.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're deficient in
either or both of those,

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
then substance A
will accumulate,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you won't have
enough substance B. And maybe

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
when you've got the right amount
of substance A in your blood,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:90%
there's no problem.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
But when it accumulates,
it behaves more

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:90%
like a poison to your body.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a problem.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And now you don't have
enough substance B,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you need
substance B for great sleep,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
restorative sleep, great energy,
a happy, calm, even mood,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.190 align:middle line:84%
or to use your body fat
effectively as a fuel.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, when we
become nutritionally deficient,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:90%
there are consequences to that.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But we're not really taught
to see our bodies like that.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:84%
When we have things that
come up with our health

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
or parts of our body
that frustrate us--

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:84%
it might be body fat that
sticks to us in places

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand, lousy
energy, or poor quality sleep.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just feedback.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't have a
voice, but it will always

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.087 align:middle line:90%
give us communication.

00:07:38.087 --> 00:07:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It will always give
us messages to let

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.280 align:middle line:84%
us know whether it's happy
or not, and it's up to us

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:90%
to decipher those messages.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we can see them as gifts
asking us to eat, drink, move,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.150 align:middle line:84%
think, breathe, believe,
or perceive in a new way,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
you can see the body
as your best friend

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and as this vehicle
that supplies you

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
with messages, guiding you to
have an even more amazing life.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
So when we understand that
that's the biochemistry driving

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
how we feel and function
and look inside of us,

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
it changes, then,
the second pillar

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:84%
in my approach, the nutritional
one, because we obviously

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
need nutrients to drive
all those reactions.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So instead of food being
this pain in the neck thing

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, I know I
need to do it better

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:84%
or I need to eat more vegetables
because an expert told me to,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:84%
it's not a she told me to,
so, therefore, I have to.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a
place of, well, I

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
understand that the Brassica
family of vegetables

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:84%
contains substances that
really support phase two liver

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.515 align:middle line:84%
detoxification
biochemical pathways.

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose
that broccoli

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
because it helps me detoxify
estrogens and pesticides.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So the choice comes from
a place of deep self-care

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:84%
rather than I read about
it, that they're important,

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and I probably should do it.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're more likely
to make sustained change

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:90%
from that place.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
pillar, of course,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
is the emotional
where I help people

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.508 align:middle line:84%
understand why they
do what they do

00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:02.068 align:middle line:90%
when they know what they know.

00:09:02.068 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So science suggests that
humans have been on the planet

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.700 align:middle line:90%
for about 150,000 years.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And I get people to visualize
that as a 30-centimeter school

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:90%
ruler.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's 150,000 years.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, 1 millimeter
on that school ruler

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:84%
represents 500 years in that
enormous amount of time.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So if we fast forward to today
or even consider the last 20

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:84%
years and we look at
the rate of change

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that we have asked our
bodies to actually undergo

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:84%
in this modern world, it is
a rate of change like never

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you put it in context
of the enormous amount of time

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.210 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
on the planet, it

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:42.628 align:middle line:84%
is not even a pinprick
amount of time in its size.

00:09:42.628 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at the fact
that social media's only just

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:84%
over 10 years old, it
wasn't that long ago

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
when we left the house, no
one could get hold of us.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
We look at the food supply,
the dramatic change that

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:84%
has gone on there with the
huge amount of processed foods

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and artificial substances
that have infiltrated the food

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:90%
supply in the very recent past.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So these things
are so new to us.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And for many
people, their bodies

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.750 align:middle line:84%
haven't yet adapted,
if they ever will.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
They've yet adapted to be
able to cope with the way

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're living, and
stress is certainly

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:90%
one of those scenarios.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So every generation, of
course, has had stress.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Many generations
have had trauma.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, that continues
in the world today.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at
people's everyday lives

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
and we look at what leads people
to make stress hormones today,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:84%
it's not the tiger coming
out of the jungle at us

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
or someone from another tribe
chasing us with their spear.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not those,
usually, thankfully,

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
those physical
threats to our life.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.180 align:middle line:84%
What leads us to make things
like adrenaline and cortisol

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
today--

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:84%
block your ears-- is
caffeine and our perception

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:90%
of pressure and urgency.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, I choose those
words very carefully

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
because we can tend to forget
that pressure and urgency is

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:90%
a perception.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
We actually choose to
see our day like that.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And what so many
people have done

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.620 align:middle line:84%
is made their email inbox
full of stress and pressure

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and urgency and
their to-do list.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we wake
up in the morning

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.590 align:middle line:84%
and we see our day as difficult
or we see that everything

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:15.340 align:middle line:84%
is urgent when maybe in reality
two things are actually urgent,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:84%
we put ourselves
into what's called

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
sympathetic nervous system
dominance, which is essentially

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.880 align:middle line:84%
the fight or flight
response, and it's adrenaline

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:90%
driving that.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we produce all
of that adrenaline,

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.250 align:middle line:84%
because it communicates what
adrenaline has communicated

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:84%
for 150,000 years, for that
whole 30-centimeter school

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
ruler, it changes our
biochemistry on the inside

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
because it literally thinks
our life is in danger,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:90%
so it prepares us to get away.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing it does is
elevate our blood pressure,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
which is an ongoing
problem for so many adults

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.860 align:middle line:84%
It changes where our
blood supply is directed.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So normally blood
supply is fantastic

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:90%
to our digestive system.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But it gets diverted
away to the periphery,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to the arms and the legs to
power to get out of danger.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.368 align:middle line:84%
And the third-- and
it does many things--

00:12:01.368 --> 00:12:03.910 align:middle line:84%
but the third and another very
powerful thing that adrenaline

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:84%
does is it changes the fuel
that your body perceives

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:90%
it is safe to use.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So in any given
moment, the body is

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
making a decision
which fuel to use,

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and it can only use glucose or
fat or a combination of both.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And when your body
is on red alert

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:84%
thinking it's got to get
out of danger quickly,

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.440 align:middle line:84%
it needs a fast-burning
fuel to power it to do that.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So take a wild guess
between glucose and fat

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:84%
which is the preferred
fuel source in that moment.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:90%
It's glucose.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.838 align:middle line:84%
So I have literally
met thousands of people

00:12:32.838 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:84%
in the almost 20 years that I've
been working with people one

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.190 align:middle line:84%
on one who have lost the ability
to effectively use their body

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:84%
fat as a fuel because
they're always

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:45.055 align:middle line:84%
relying on their glucose because
of stress hormone production.

00:12:45.055 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:84%
The next thing that
happens when we're always

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.850 align:middle line:84%
in that stressed-out
place-- that's

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
essentially phase one of stress,
which is high adrenaline.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But because with
high adrenaline,

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
it creates a lot of
inflammation in the body.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the body knows that
inflammation is the beginning

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:90%
of most degenerative disease.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's trying to
keep you alive.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.280 align:middle line:84%
So it needs to dampen
down that inflammation.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And because, historically,
adrenaline production

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:84%
was short lived-- we
escaped from the danger,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:84%
we won the fight, whatever
happened happened,

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:90%
but it was short lived.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And now that you've been making
adrenaline for the last year

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:84%
or decade, the
body says, well, I

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
can't sustain this
level of inflammation.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I now need to go into the
second stage of stress,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:84%
which is when your
cortisol starts to elevate.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, historically for
the 150,000 years,

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
cortisol has communicated
to every cell in the body

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that there's no food
left in the world

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:84%
because the only chronic stress
humans historically had were

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.228 align:middle line:90%
floods and famines and wars.

00:13:41.228 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And so if you had a bit
more flesh on your bones,

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:84%
you're more likely to get
through this supposed famine

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.900 align:middle line:90%
that you're part of.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
But in modern times,
our long-term stress

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
tends to be around our
financial concerns, relationship

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.080 align:middle line:90%
concerns.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:84%
It might be health concerns or
the health concerns of a loved

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:56.170 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.845 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of people,
it's their weight.

00:13:57.845 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Their first waking thought in
the morning is, what will I

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
or won't I eat today, how much
exercise can I get done today,

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and I can live in this
perpetual state of never feeling

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.850 align:middle line:84%
like their body is OK and
enough the way that it is.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So the stress can
come from many places.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
But when we're producing
excessive amounts of cortisol,

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
its job is to slow
your metabolism down

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.930 align:middle line:90%
to get you through a famine.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%
And so your clothes get tighter.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And what's most
people's response

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.342 align:middle line:90%
when their clothes get tighter.

00:14:24.342 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:84%
They think, oh, I
better go on a diet.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you go on
a diet, you tend

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.485 align:middle line:84%
to eat less, which just confirms
to your body what it perceives

00:14:30.485 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:84%
is true, which is that there's
no food left in the world.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it slows your
metabolism even further.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's one tiny little
reason why diets don't work.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
It's why honing in and focusing
on supporting why the body is

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:84%
making cortisol in
the first place,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:84%
supporting the health
of the adrenal glands

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.823 align:middle line:84%
where you make these stress
hormones from is essential.

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
stage of stress

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:84%
when we stay in that very busy,
intense, everything's full

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
of pressure and urgency,
when we stay in that place,

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
you can go into what we call
stage three stress, which

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.390 align:middle line:84%
is when the adrenal glands
can no longer sustain

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:90%
that level of cortisol output.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's really become
known as adrenal fatigue.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you wake
up in the morning,

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.045 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you've
been hit by a bus.

00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:14.890 align:middle line:84%
The fatigue is deep
and relentless.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So the consequences of
being intensely busy

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and perceiving all that pressure
and urgency in our lives,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.150 align:middle line:84%
the long-term
consequences of that

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.920 align:middle line:90%
are deeply concerning to me.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And it also doesn't
have to be that way

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
because if we pause for a
minute and consider what

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.290 align:middle line:84%
the real currency of health
is, I believe it's energy,

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and for too long
it's been weight.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But when we stop and
think about energy,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.090 align:middle line:84%
when we don't have energy,
everything is more difficult.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.700 align:middle line:84%
When you're tired,
it impacts the foods

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that you choose, whether
you get off the couch

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and go for a walk or not, the
jobs that you would apply for,

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:84%
the friends that you
make, your self-talk,

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and the way you speak to
everyone you love in the world.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So when we wake up in the
morning and we're exhausted,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.090 align:middle line:84%
what do most people
do about that?

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:90%
They reach for a coffee.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't
fix why they're

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:90%
tired in the first place.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So my point is, most
people don't do anything

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:90%
about lousy energy.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:90%
They blame it on their life.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
They blame it on the fact that
they work full time and study

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:84%
part time, and they're
raising three children

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and have a relationship
that they want to maintain,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and they might
have aging parents,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and I remember a lady
once saying to me,

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and I have to catch
airplanes for work,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and airplanes don't
wait, you know?

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And when people describe
what is essentially

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:35.230 align:middle line:84%
a really privileged life
as being really difficult,

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I know they don't really
mean the complaint

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.182 align:middle line:90%
that I can hear in their voice.

00:16:39.182 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:84%
They're just
exhausted, and there's

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
nothing left for them
at the end of that.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And the sadness
for me in that is

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that so many people have
stopped letting themselves have

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:90%
what they already have.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
let yourself have

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
what is right in front
of you-- a majestic view,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
watching your children
sleep, the fact

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:84%
that when you turn
the tap on the water

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.770 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make you sick.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So when we lose touch with
what is right here, right now,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:84%
and the gifts of all of
that, I feel like I always

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
want to say to people, what
else are you denying yourself?

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:84%
What else are you
depriving yourself of?

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.022 align:middle line:84%
Because when you speak
to people who are dying

00:17:17.022 --> 00:17:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and you ask them
what they're going

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
to miss the most
in the world, they

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:90%
say the most ordinary things--

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
their partner's
face, the feeling

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
of their dog's fur
under their hands,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:84%
the smell of a freshly cut
lemon, or the night sky.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have all
of that right now.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So for me, a big part of
health is letting yourself have

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.510 align:middle line:90%
what you already have.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It's what joy is all
about, and joy gives us

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.000 align:middle line:84%
an irreplaceable
depth of energy.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And the more we connect
to that, the more

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.697 align:middle line:90%
we spend time across what is--

00:17:47.697 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not denying
they're not busy days.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But the more we connect to the
joy that is always available,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.570 align:middle line:84%
even when there's really
tough stuff going on,

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:84%
the better supported
your nervous system is,

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:84%
the better the nutrients
get around your body.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:90%
The way you breathe changes.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:84%
What you focus on
is what you feel.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:90%
That changes.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So just those micro
pauses throughout the day

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
or having that background
sound of I'm so fortunate

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.220 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so grateful can be game
changing for people's health.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
For me, "stressed" is really
the achiever's word for fear

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of not
OK in this day and age

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
to walk around going I'm
really scared of that,

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm really scared of that.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
But when people share with me
what they're stressed about,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
if I pull the curtains back on
that, what I'll actually see

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:90%
is what they're frightened of.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.510 align:middle line:84%
They're frightened of
letting people down.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
They're frightened of how
other people see them.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we can actually,
in those moments

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:84%
where we feel really worked
up and really stressed,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:84%
if we can pause there and think,
what am I really worried about,

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:84%
it's not actually
about running late

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:84%
or it's not actually about
not replying to that email

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:90%
promptly.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
It's nearly always
about how we perceive

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:90%
people are going to see us.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we can pause and
catch ourself in that,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:84%
you can create a new story
around that and think,

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
well, I know them, they
know me better than that,

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and you can reframe
it and start afresh.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.120 align:middle line:84%
On a physical level, when we're
in sympathetic nervous system

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:84%
dominance, when we're in
that red zone in that fight

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
or flight response, the
only thing science currently

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:84%
knows that will
get us out of that

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.070 align:middle line:84%
is to extend the length
of our exhalation.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So the other arm of
the nervous system

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:84%
is called the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the rest, digest,
repair, reproduce arm

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:90%
of the nervous system.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And from that place, our body
is able to work so incredibly

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.760 align:middle line:90%
efficiently.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
We're able to use our body
fat effectively as a fuel,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's simply
because it's getting

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
the message via
the nervous system

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that it is safe to do all
of those key processes,

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
including use our
body fat as a fuel.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So to come out of
those stress places,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I do think people have to
be honest with themselves

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:90%
about how caffeine affects them.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to explore
our perception of pressure

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and urgency and save it
for when we really need it,

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.970 align:middle line:84%
not make what is just a busy
or opportunity-filled day

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.830 align:middle line:84%
full of pressure
and urgency, and we

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.600 align:middle line:90%
need to become breath aware.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.730 align:middle line:84%
So essentially what
I mean by that is we

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.305 align:middle line:84%
need to diaphragmatically
breathe.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you breathe in
through your nostrils,

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.210 align:middle line:84%
with the inhalation, your
tummy starts to stick out.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a gentle pause
at the end of that inhalation,

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:90%
and then you slowly exhale--

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:90%
again, through your nostrils.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And your belly comes back
in towards your spine.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And if you can really slow
that style of breathing down,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:84%
your body gets the message
via your nervous system

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:90%
that you're safe.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously we
all have to breathe,

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:84%
but it's reminding
ourselves to become

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
breath aware through a
potentially busy day.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So you might start with
a breath focus practice,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:84%
whether it's yoga,
meditation, Pilates, Tai Chi.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
If none of those
things appeal, it

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:84%
might just be
going to the window

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:84%
or going outside, placing your
hands on top of your tummy

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and thinking of the things
that you're grateful for.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It might be every time you're
stopped at red traffic lights,

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:84%
instead of checking social media
or sending emails, you actually

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:90%
breathe diaphragmatically.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
When you boil the kettle
first thing in the morning

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.440 align:middle line:84%
to make warm water and
lemon juice, of course,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
you stand there and
breathe diaphragmatically--

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
so just taking those micro
pauses throughout the day

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
to check in with
your breath and just

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:84%
commit to becoming
more breath aware.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:29.370 align:middle line:84%
The more time we spend in
that diaphragmatic breathing

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.530 align:middle line:84%
place, the more supported our
nervous system is going to be.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's incredible
technology now being

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
developed where you can swallow
a camera that's actually

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:84%
the size of a little,
tiny vitamin capsule,

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and it gives you about
15 hours of footage

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
from inside the
digestive system.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.550 align:middle line:90%
So it totally spins my tires.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:90%
The visuals you get are amazing.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And what the researchers did was
they gave one group of people

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:59.940 align:middle line:90%
a homemade meal.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
They actually made
noodles from scratch

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
just from flour and
water and served it

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.972 align:middle line:84%
in a broth made from water and
vegetables and salt and pepper.

00:22:06.972 --> 00:22:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
group, they were

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
given bought noodles
from the supermarket that

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
come with the sachet that
you add hot water to,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and that was served with a blue
drink, a blue sports drink.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they
swallowed these cameras

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to give the visuals
of what then went on.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And four hours after they
swallowed the real food meal,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
all that was left was white
fluff in the digestive system.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.648 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it's
supposed to be,

00:22:30.648 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
really well broken
down by that stage.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But for the people who had
the bought food meal, four

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
hours after they ate it
and swallowed the camera,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:84%
you can still see the
teeth marks in the noodles.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
So what that suggests
is if you have

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:84%
food in your digestive system
for four hours exposed to all

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:84%
of your digestive enzymes and
it hasn't been broken down,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:84%
it suggests that maybe
there are substances in some

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:84%
of these processed foods that we
have no ability to break down.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, our food is where
our energy comes from.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So why on earth would we
want to mess with that?

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But then further to
that, the blue drink

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.800 align:middle line:84%
had actually dyed
the noodles blue.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the dye in the
blue drink was actually

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.360 align:middle line:84%
derived from
petroleum, and there's

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:84%
nothing inside the
human body that

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:90%
allows us to break down petrol.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And as ludicrous as that sounds,
sadly that's our reality today.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we think about
150,000 years that humans

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:84%
have been on the
planet, we've been

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:84%
exposed to these things for
a drop in the ocean of time.

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So a number of artificial
substances and colors

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and sweeteners are created
synthetically, and some

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.445 align:middle line:84%
of the substances that
they're derived from,

00:23:39.445 --> 00:23:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I have concerns about
whether they even

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:90%
belong in the human body.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.968 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
gluten and grains,

00:23:52.968 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
a lot of people now

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.090 align:middle line:84%
who might be suspicious
that they're potentially

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.370 align:middle line:84%
causing a problem for them,
especially with their gut.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.745 align:middle line:84%
They might notice
after they have

00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:02.280 align:middle line:84%
a sandwich that
their tummy bloats

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're curious about
whether it's causing that.

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the path
for a lot of people

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.290 align:middle line:84%
is to check in with their
medical professional,

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and the only test
we really currently

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.450 align:middle line:84%
have in conventional medicine
for gluten sensitivity

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:90%
is the one for celiac disease.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And if that's negative, I
think that a lot of people

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.922 align:middle line:84%
then think, oh, well,
it mustn't be that.

00:24:22.922 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It must be something
else that I'm eating

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.255 align:middle line:84%
or maybe I'm stressed
and that's what's

00:24:26.255 --> 00:24:28.230 align:middle line:90%
causing the gut problems.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's really
important for people

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:84%
to consider that technology
advances sometimes rapidly,

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.330 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes really
slowly, and what

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:84%
if there are 800 different
mechanisms through which

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
the human body can react to
gluten or other substances

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.730 align:middle line:90%
in grains?

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Your body is your barometer.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you start to pay
attention to the foods

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:84%
that you think might
be causing a problem,

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:90%
you need to trust that.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:84%
You have this incredible
wisdom inside yourself.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:90%
You want to listen to that.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
to really know is

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
to take a break from those
foods for a period of time.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:84%
If you leave them
out long term, I

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.410 align:middle line:84%
do think it's wise to consult
with the health professional

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you're not missing
out on potential nutrients

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:90%
that you might need.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
But you'll get your answer if
you eliminate the food that you

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.692 align:middle line:84%
are suspicious of, and
if you feel better,

00:25:16.692 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
there's your answer, or you
can bring it back and see

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.010 align:middle line:90%
if the symptoms come back.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But my point is that there are
only so many tests we currently

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.330 align:middle line:84%
have in the world, and there
are potentially many more

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms of gluten sensitivity
that we don't yet understand,

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.383 align:middle line:84%
and eventually technology
will catch up with that.

00:25:33.383 --> 00:25:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I also think it's
really important

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:90%
to consider human history.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So where we've come from
guides us, to some degree,

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:84%
about the food choices
that we need to make.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you consider people of
Irish heritage, up until 1845,

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.500 align:middle line:84%
the major source
of starch for them,

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:90%
essentially, was potatoes.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But then the potato famine
hit, and they grew crops

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:57.780 align:middle line:84%
on a large scale really for the
first time in their history.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a really
strong genetic line

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:04.230 align:middle line:84%
for autoimmune diseases,
including celiac disease,

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:90%
down that Irish bloodline.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you think
about it, they've

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.560 align:middle line:84%
only really been eating
grains for about seven

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.030 align:middle line:90%
or eight generations.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's a drop
in the ocean of time

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:84%
to expose your digestive
system to a brand-new food.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So my question
always is, do we have

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:84%
the equipment
inside of ourselves

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.480 align:middle line:84%
to break some of
these foods down?

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is potentially
highly individual.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:84%
But what I've seen in my
clinical practice over nearly

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
20 years is that there are many
people who benefit enormously

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:38.040 align:middle line:84%
with their physical health,
with their happiness,

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.440 align:middle line:84%
with their performance,
with their strength,

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:84%
just with how robust they
feel in life when they make

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.020 align:middle line:84%
a change to how they
eat that actually serves

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.440 align:middle line:90%
their own individual needs.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:55.940 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So I have deep concerns
for children's nutrition.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment in
the Western world,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
there are about 42
million obese children

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:07.650 align:middle line:84%
between the ages
of zero and five.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, as adults, we are
responsible for that.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say that to elicit
guilt. It's just how it is.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
They're too little to make
their own food choices.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%
We are their guiding
lights with that.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And my concern
with that is, if we

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
stay on that trajectory,
those numbers, by 2025,

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.320 align:middle line:84%
are going to be somewhere
up around 70 million.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But also, the children right now
between zero and five who are

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.990 align:middle line:90%
obese--

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:84%
common sense and science
shows that if you're

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.610 align:middle line:84%
obese as a child,
you're more likely to be

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.560 align:middle line:90%
obese as a teenager.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, for a woman,
for a girl, even

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:84%
for boys, the more
body fat you have,

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:84%
the more estrogen your body
makes because your body

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:84%
fat cells are one of the
production units for estrogen.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So the more body fat we have
or the larger those cells,

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:90%
the more estrogen we make.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So when children have
higher levels of body fat

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:84%
at younger and younger ages,
their whole endocrine system,

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.630 align:middle line:84%
their whole hormonal system,
is being flooded with estrogen

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:84%
at an age that is
just too young.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And the number of
girls who are starting

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to menstruate now at
younger and younger ages

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:90%
is deeply concerning.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
obesity and when

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
we talk about the
highly processed foods,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.700 align:middle line:84%
the refined sugars,
the refined starches,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:84%
the artificial sweeteners and
colors and flavorings that

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
are in food, all
of those things are

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.830 align:middle line:84%
contributing to that
enormous challenge

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:84%
that we are facing
on this planet.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
the obesity itself.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the consequences of
that because we don't want

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.907 align:middle line:90%
those precious young people--

00:28:46.907 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:90%
they're babies themselves.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't want them to have
a baby at such a young age.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:90%
It's deeply concerning to me.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.610 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to artificial
sweeteners and colors

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and preservatives,
we need to pause

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and bring common sense
back to that conversation

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.660 align:middle line:84%
because, as a race
of people, we've

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.780 align:middle line:84%
been exposed to these substances
for the tiniest amount of time.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So we actually don't
really understand

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:84%
what is going to happen
inside of our bodies

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:84%
when we're exposed to
these things every day

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.213 align:middle line:90%
decade after decade.

00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a big
question mark there.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:25.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:28.230 align:middle line:84%
If you knew who
you truly are, you

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.670 align:middle line:90%
would be in awe of yourself.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like most people
live their lives completely out

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.300 align:middle line:90%
of touch with that.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.390 align:middle line:84%
If you lived your life
even a tiny bit more

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:42.120 align:middle line:84%
in touch with that, it
would change your choices.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So our health is
essentially made up

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:84%
of hundreds if not
thousands of choices

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.640 align:middle line:90%
that we make across a day.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Will I go back for seconds
after dinner tonight?

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Wine or water this evening?

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Will I stay back at work or
will I go home to my family?

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Will I go to bed or
do some more emails?

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:90%
One biscuit or six?

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So the questions, the
choices that we're faced with

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.860 align:middle line:84%
are consistent and
almost never ending

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.430 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to our health.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So we want to make more choices
in the direction of taking care

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
of ourself and fewer
choices towards things

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that take away from our health.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So when we are more
in touch really

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.680 align:middle line:84%
with how precious life is,
when we live our lives in touch

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.480 align:middle line:84%
with what we were
born knowing, which

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is that each and every one of
us are special, when you live

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
your life in touch with
that, it changes the choices

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.550 align:middle line:84%
that you make because
you want to take

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.440 align:middle line:84%
care of this physical
structure that you've

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:84%
been given to have this
extraordinary experience called

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.520 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So I want everyone living
their lives more in touch

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:90%
with how precious they are.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.420 align:middle line:84%
For every single human,
their greatest fear

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.363 align:middle line:90%
is that they are not enough.

00:30:55.363 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And if they aren't enough,
then they won't be loved.

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
There is not a human
that escapes that,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and its psychology 101.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.760 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is when we're babies,

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.120 align:middle line:84%
we believe in our autonomic
nervous system, the part

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that we can't govern
with our thoughts,

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.600 align:middle line:90%
the part we can't instruct.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.270 align:middle line:84%
We believe it deeply in that
autonomic nervous system

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.430 align:middle line:84%
that love is essential
for our survival

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:19.090 align:middle line:84%
because, as small
human babies, it is.

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.052 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to care
enough about us

00:31:21.052 --> 00:31:22.760 align:middle line:84%
to give us food and
clothing and shelter.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We can't get those
things on our own.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Other animal species can do
it from day one by themselves.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.120 align:middle line:90%
But we can't.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So it is there in
our DNA from the day

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.490 align:middle line:84%
we are born that love is
essential for our survival.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But we know as adults that
a life with love in it

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.120 align:middle line:84%
is delicious and
soul nourishing,

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.830 align:middle line:84%
but we can actually
live without it

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:84%
because we can obtain our own
food and clothing, and shelter.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, they
live their whole life

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:84%
believing that love is still
essential for survival,

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and it drives their
behavior hugely.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And here's the best
way I've come to be

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.770 align:middle line:90%
able to explain that so far.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So when we are little, from
an emotional maturation

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:05.840 align:middle line:84%
perspective, we are
what's called egocentric.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, some people
maybe never change.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But all that really means is
that when you're egocentric,

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.920 align:middle line:84%
you believe that you're
the center of the universe.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So you believe that the way that
people are in your environment,

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:84%
you believe they are the
way they are because of you.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So when they're happy, you link
it in your mind immediately,

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:84%
not consciously-- it's
wired in your nervous system

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.450 align:middle line:84%
That's because I
just told a joke.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:84%
That's because I just did a
beautiful finger painting.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And so parts of your
personality are born from that.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The observations you make
on people's faces that light

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
them up, you link it
to your own behavior.

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.830 align:middle line:84%
However, sadly,
the same thing also

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:84%
happens when the people
in your environment

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.870 align:middle line:90%
are dissatisfied or unhappy.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.460 align:middle line:90%
You link it to you.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.830 align:middle line:90%
So before the age of seven--

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:90%
again, it's basic psychology.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Before the age of seven,
every single human

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
has created a belief in
their own deficiency,

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and we do it to make
sense of our environment.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:07.072 align:middle line:84%
So let's say normally when
your dad comes home from work,

00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the first thing he does is
picks you up and plays with you.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.460 align:middle line:90%
You're four years old.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:90%
You love it.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.050 align:middle line:90%
You look forward to it.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.842 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
he doesn't do that

00:33:13.842 --> 00:33:15.050 align:middle line:90%
and you're sent to your room.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:16.553 align:middle line:84%
And you can hear
he and your mother

00:33:16.553 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
having an intense
conversation in the kitchen.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.460 align:middle line:90%
There's raised voices.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.880 align:middle line:84%
There's fist banging
on the table.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And you don't understand it
other than that it feels yucky

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.300 align:middle line:90%
in your nervous system.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Your brain, in that
moment, is looking

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:84%
for an explanation for this
scenario because it's brand new

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:90%
and it's uncomfortable for you.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And we can't look
into their world

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and see that dad's behaving
with such intensity

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.560 align:middle line:84%
because he was
just made redundant

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.268 align:middle line:84%
and now he doesn't
know how on earth he's

00:33:41.268 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:90%
going to pay for your education.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So the expression
"with intensity"

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is actually out of deep
love and care for you.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't see that
when you're egocentric.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.160 align:middle line:84%
All you know is that
it feels uncomfortable.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.982 align:middle line:84%
And the only way your brain can
make sense of what's going on

00:33:55.982 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to
believe that there's

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.970 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with you.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.730 align:middle line:84%
But the trick is that
we're not taught to see

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.680 align:middle line:90%
our brain as a meaning maker.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.230 align:middle line:84%
We're not taught to see
that nothing in the world

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:84%
has meaning unless
we give it meaning.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.201 align:middle line:84%
So because we don't
understand that

00:34:10.201 --> 00:34:11.659 align:middle line:84%
and we're not aware
that we've just

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.900 align:middle line:84%
created a belief that we're not
good enough, not tall enough,

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:84%
not pretty enough, not thin
enough, not smart enough, just

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:84%
not enough the way that we
are, because we don't realize

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.650 align:middle line:84%
we've just absorbed that belief
from our environment, what then

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:27.969 align:middle line:84%
happens is you go looking
for evidence of your beliefs

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:28.882 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:34:28.882 --> 00:34:31.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of our brain
called the reticular activating

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.590 align:middle line:84%
system that hunts
those things down,

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.020 align:middle line:84%
hunts our beliefs out to
show us that they're true.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.659 align:middle line:84%
So if you think that
people can't be trusted,

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:84%
you will look for evidence of
how that is true everywhere,

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.505 align:middle line:84%
and you'll miss all the
examples of how it's not true.

00:34:44.505 --> 00:34:46.880 align:middle line:84%
If you believe that there
aren't enough hours in the day,

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.230 align:middle line:90%
that will be your experience.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:50.090 align:middle line:84%
You'll live your life
with such intensity--

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.590 align:middle line:84%
there aren't enough
hours in a day--

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.170 align:middle line:84%
whereas the person who sits
at the desk beside you,

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
they might have 50 more things
on their to-do list each day,

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.015 align:middle line:84%
but they cruise through the
day, and they get more done,

00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's because they believe
that the important things

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.190 align:middle line:90%
always get done.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So your beliefs create
your experience.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.200 align:middle line:84%
You know what it's like when you
suddenly want to buy a new car.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Pick on a red hatchback.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.293 align:middle line:84%
Don't you see them
everywhere when

00:35:12.293 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:84%
you think that that's
the one you want to buy?

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's not suddenly more
red hatchbacks on the road.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.170 align:middle line:90%
They've always been there.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:84%
All you've done is primed
the reticular activating

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.472 align:middle line:84%
system in your brain
to go looking for them.

00:35:23.472 --> 00:35:24.930 align:middle line:84%
If you're a female,
you tend to go,

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.980 align:middle line:84%
oh, it's a sign
I better get one.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:84%
But the same is true
with your beliefs.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:33.860 align:middle line:84%
You look for evidence of your
not enoughness everywhere.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And so because you're constantly
scratching the itch of that not

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.230 align:middle line:90%
enoughness, it holds you back.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It holds you back from
the truth of who you are.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.710 align:middle line:90%
It holds you back.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.020 align:middle line:84%
You lose touch with what
you were born knowing,

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:84%
which is that you're
capable of anything.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So until we begin to
explore our beliefs--

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.080 align:middle line:84%
we all have beliefs
that are great for us.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But many people-- most people
have beliefs that limit them

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.630 align:middle line:90%
until they go and explore this.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to
pull the curtains back

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:84%
on those limiting
beliefs, you start

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.410 align:middle line:84%
to see that really
where they've come from

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
is a great big story
you told yourself

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.820 align:middle line:84%
to try to make
sense of something

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that you found uncomfortable
when you were little.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.713 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at them with
adult eyes, you can see them,

00:36:16.713 --> 00:36:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the benefit
that will have come from them,

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and there might be lovely
aspects in your personality

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.200 align:middle line:84%
that have been
created from that,

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:84%
but you can now
see, as an adult,

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually
now holding you

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:31.040 align:middle line:84%
back from the life you were
destined to live, from the life

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:84%
that you were destined,
that you're called for

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.540 align:middle line:84%
to serve your bigger purpose,
because if you believe

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:84%
you aren't enough, you'll never
believe that you have enough,

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and you'll live your
whole life always

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.040 align:middle line:90%
in the pursuit of having.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to change that
conversation because surely it

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.950 align:middle line:84%
is all really
about contribution.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:56.720 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I think we can get
really caught up

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:84%
in the doing of everyday
life, and we often

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.340 align:middle line:84%
don't pause to reflect
what really lights us up,

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:90%
what really nourishes our soul.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I meet so many people who want
to know what their purpose is,

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:90%
and they can't find it.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't even know
where to start looking.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And My advice always
to those people

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.940 align:middle line:84%
is forget worrying
about your purpose.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Find out what you care about.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.090 align:middle line:90%
But here's the kicker.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:90%
You've got to take action on it.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to take
action on what you care about--

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
because there are things
in the world right now

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:90%
that are unacceptable.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
a fire inside you

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that recognizes that
that's unacceptable,

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that's your soul
calling you to action.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you take action on those
things, on what you actually

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:84%
care about and making
a difference in there,

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.420 align:middle line:84%
you'll forget about your
purpose, but I bet you find it.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you wake
up in the morning,

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:84%
if you can ask the
question, how can I

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:55.670 align:middle line:84%
best serve today, how can
I best be of service today,

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.850 align:middle line:84%
it shifts the genre
of your whole life.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:01.030 align:middle line:90%
It changes the way--

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.960 align:middle line:84%
it changes the
questions you ask.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It changes the
choices that you make,

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.210 align:middle line:84%
the actions that you take,
and your most important thing

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:10.640 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, your
purpose on this planet

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.220 align:middle line:84%
might be to raise a happy
and healthy and well-adjusted

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.020 align:middle line:90%
child.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Your purpose on
this planet might

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.560 align:middle line:84%
be to pick up litter
every time you

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:84%
see it because that,
in the long term,

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.430 align:middle line:90%
is game changing for the planet.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:25.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
big, off-the-charts,

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:28.640 align:middle line:84%
dreamlike sequences that
you need to bring to life.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.140 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it is that, and
that's magical and breathtaking

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.550 align:middle line:90%
and an honor to witness.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But what is just as
big an honor to witness

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:41.072 align:middle line:84%
are parents who love and
adore their children so much

00:38:41.072 --> 00:38:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that they're raising
those children

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.870 align:middle line:84%
to know that they are
enough because when you know

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
you are enough, you stop
worrying about having and

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.630 align:middle line:84%
having enough and
you live your life

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.855 align:middle line:84%
in service in complete
contribution to others.

00:38:53.855 --> 00:39:02.090 align:middle line:90%


00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.210 align:middle line:84%
I think a huge key to
fulfillment is service.

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we might think we've
overcome worrying about what

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.902 align:middle line:84%
other people think of us, but
if you pull the curtains back

00:39:11.902 --> 00:39:13.610 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of your
choices, you'll probably

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:84%
see that you probably do
still worry about what

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.930 align:middle line:90%
other people think of you.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you can pause
in those moments

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.997 align:middle line:84%
and see that you don't need to
worry about that, that they're

00:39:22.997 --> 00:39:24.830 align:middle line:84%
there for the long haul,
that they love you,

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.920 align:middle line:84%
they respect you-- and actually,
if they don't, then maybe they

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.490 align:middle line:90%
don't belong in your life.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And if we can move beyond
worrying about what others

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.070 align:middle line:84%
think of us and live
our life in service,

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:39.050 align:middle line:84%
the fulfillment that comes
with that is indescribable.

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, that can be
on a massive scale.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.820 align:middle line:90%
That can be on a tiny scale.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.470 align:middle line:84%
It actually does
matter because it's

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:90%
what your soul is called for.

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.400 align:middle line:84%
I feel like the conversations
around spirituality

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:84%
are so often about
ego and about oneness

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:58.010 align:middle line:90%
and the division of those two.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And the peace and
the joy that comes

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:84%
with connecting to what is is
obviously far more conducive

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:84%
to amazing health, to
service, to fulfillment

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.270 align:middle line:84%
than responding consistently
from the ego, which

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:14.090 align:middle line:84%
is so worried about how
other people see us.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But I want to take the
conversation a step further

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and bring in the concept of
our essence and essentially

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:24.440 align:middle line:84%
our soul because we are
all here with a uniqueness.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.880 align:middle line:84%
We are all here with
many gifts inside of us

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.760 align:middle line:84%
that we have this incredible
opportunity to bring to life,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:90%
and you don't want to miss that.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to miss
this opportunity called

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.180 align:middle line:90%
life, whatever that looks like.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But to do that, to call into
action what you are here

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to do and contribute
that essence in you,

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.900 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
great physical health,

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:84%
because without our
health, we have nothing.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want it to be a
health crisis that wakes you up

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:54.410 align:middle line:90%
to teach you that.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:56.390 align:middle line:84%
You know in your
own heart when you

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.490 align:middle line:84%
need to make some different
choices when it comes

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.170 align:middle line:90%
to how you look after yourself.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't need me to sit
here and say, you probably

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.740 align:middle line:90%
need to eat a bit less sugar.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.830 align:middle line:84%
You already know in your
own heart if you do that.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.800 align:middle line:84%
What I care about is what
stops you taking action

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.130 align:middle line:84%
on what you know to be true when
it comes to your food choices,

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.590 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to how you
speak to the people you love

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.150 align:middle line:84%
the most in the
world, and when it

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:21.440 align:middle line:84%
comes to how you bring your
purpose in this world to life.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.730 align:middle line:90%
They all feed each other.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.020 align:middle line:84%
You almost can't have
one without the other.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose is so
breathtaking to witness

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.390 align:middle line:84%
when we have extraordinary
health and energy.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:39.045 align:middle line:90%


00:41:39.045 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the most beautiful
things I think we witness

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.410 align:middle line:84%
is when the light is really
on in someone's eyes.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And when that light is there,
their body is nourished,

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.170 align:middle line:84%
their soul is nourished,
and they're usually

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.690 align:middle line:90%
living their life on purpose.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want people to be aware
of the ripple effect of that.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.360 align:middle line:84%
What's life like when you
come into contact with someone

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that has that light,
that amazing energy?

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.410 align:middle line:90%
You can't not be affected by it.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So when we step up and take
even better care of ourselves,

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:07.270 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't just impact us.

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It impacts every single person
we come into contact with.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's that ripple effect
that I am obsessed about

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.640 align:middle line:84%
because when we are
looking after ourselves,

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.150 align:middle line:84%
whatever that looks like
for us-- food, nourishment,

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:22.480 align:middle line:84%
movement, great sleep, exposure
to the beautiful sunshine that

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:84%
we have and living a
life of contribution--

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.020 align:middle line:84%
when you have those aspects
that are alive in your life,

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.790 align:middle line:84%
the way you interact
with everyone

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:33.970 align:middle line:84%
is so different if those
things aren't occurring.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So don't ever think that
it is selfish to nourish

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.840 align:middle line:84%
yourself, to take
time out, to go

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
for a walk barefoot on the
sand, and to find that purpose

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and follow it and trust
yourself and back yourself.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.190 align:middle line:90%
That's not selfish.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.250 align:middle line:84%
That's necessary more
than ever at this time

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:84%
on the planet because
of the ripple effect

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that you then generate
from the aliveness

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.940 align:middle line:90%
that you demonstrate to others.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.550 align:middle line:84%
My mission is to
educate and inspire,

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.410 align:middle line:84%
enhancing people's
health and happiness,

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:05.310 align:middle line:84%
igniting a ripple effect
that transforms the world.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And I don't say that lightly.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I say that because
I've witnessed it now

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.080 align:middle line:90%
in thousands of people.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:13.870 align:middle line:84%
When that light comes
on, the ripple effect

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:17.320 align:middle line:84%
of their choices, of the way
they speak to other people

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:84%
is game changing
for those others.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
most important changes

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that certainly I care about
right now on this planet

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
is reminding people of what they
already know in their hearts,

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and that is that
life is so precious

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and that they are
precious and that they

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.438 align:middle line:84%
need to treat
themselves accordingly.

00:43:37.438 --> 00:43:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.800 align:middle line:84%
The human body is
so extraordinary.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:84%
We're actually made up of
about 50 trillion cells, which

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:84%
is a number that can
so easily go over

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.850 align:middle line:90%
our heads with its enormity.

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So let me use time as an
example to demonstrate

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.110 align:middle line:90%
the enormity of that.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So one million seconds
ago was 12 days ago.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.770 align:middle line:84%
One billion seconds
ago was 32 years ago.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.800 align:middle line:84%
But one trillion seconds
ago was 32,000 years ago.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have about 50 trillion
cells that make you up.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So the best way to picture
that is 50 trillion

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:16.490 align:middle line:84%
tiny, little circles, and they
all want to talk to each other.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But the only way
they can communicate

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.570 align:middle line:84%
is when there are
nutrients present.

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have grave concerns that
there are just too many people

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.510 align:middle line:84%
not getting the
nutrients that are

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:29.650 align:middle line:84%
essential for very basic
cell-to-cell communication.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:32.390 align:middle line:84%
We are essentially the
health of our cells.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, because of incredible
advances in the world,

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.900 align:middle line:90%
we are living a lot longer.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Our life expectancy has
almost doubled since 1900.

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:84%
However, a big
question to ponder

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:49.090 align:middle line:84%
is, are we living too
short and dying too long?

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So we still want to be
able to bend over and do up

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.100 align:middle line:84%
our own shoelaces in the
second half of our life.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:84%
You don't want your tummy to
have gotten so big that you can

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.450 align:middle line:84%
no longer reach your
feet or your spine

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:00.160 align:middle line:84%
to have become so
inflexible that you

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.005 align:middle line:90%
can no longer get to your toes.

00:45:02.005 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to people
who can no longer put

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.970 align:middle line:84%
on their own shoes, they regret
the choices in the first half

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.860 align:middle line:90%
of their life very much.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So the choices we
make today don't just

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:13.360 align:middle line:84%
impact how we feel
and function today.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.720 align:middle line:84%
They're going to impact what
that entire future looks like.

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And the power to change that is
in your hands and in your hands

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.350 align:middle line:90%
only.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.063 align:middle line:90%
No one else can do it for you.

00:45:22.063 --> 00:45:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you have
to believe that you're

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.550 align:middle line:90%
worth taking care of.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:32.672 align:middle line:90%
