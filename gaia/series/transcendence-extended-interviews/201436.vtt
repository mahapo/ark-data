00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:09.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, it's James here
from Food Matters.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.370 align:middle line:10%
And today we're going to be
speaking with Daniel Vitalis.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.400 align:middle line:10%
Daniel is a modern-day
hunter gatherer.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.520 align:middle line:84%
He is the founder of
SurThrival, and Find a Spring,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.358 align:middle line:84%
and also the host of a new
series called "WildFed."

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about some interesting topics

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:84%
today, including
the domestication

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:84%
of the human species
and what it takes

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.560 align:middle line:84%
for us to rewild ourselves
so that we can live

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:84%
a happier, healthier,
and more authentic

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.558 align:middle line:90%
life connected with nature.

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Daniel, how you're doing.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm doing really
great, thanks for having me.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm excited to chat.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:90%
It's been a while--

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It has been.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> --between our conversations.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.090 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of what
drew me into your work

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
initially was this
idea that you helped

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
me understand that we had become
an of the household species,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:90%
a domesticated species.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.953 align:middle line:84%
And after coming
to that realization

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
through our
conversations, I think

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
it just helped me understand
the world in a different way

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and to see all the
different ways that we've

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:90%
been conditioned.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe this
idea to me and what

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
it means to be a modern
domesticated human?

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:90%
How do we get here really?

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think the easiest way
to put it in context for people

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
is thinking about dogs
and what dogs are.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So all of us are
familiar with dogs.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:84%
We've all lived in
and amongst dogs,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.940 align:middle line:84%
even if we're not dog
lovers or dog owners.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:84%
We know lots of
dogs as individuals.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of them
biologically is a gray wolf.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:84%
They're not related
to gray wolves,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:90%
they actually are gray wolves.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
breeds you can really

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.870 align:middle line:84%
see that it's easy to
understand if we see like any

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Alaskan sled
dog-type breeds

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:84%
or we see even a German
shepherd, you can look at that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:90%
and go I see the wolf in that.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.480 align:middle line:84%
But you start to get down
to a Shih Tzu, or a pitbull,

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
or a little terrier, and
you don't see the gray wolf

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:84%
anymore, you see that
domestication has changed them.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So the great wolf is Canis
lupus and the domesticated dog

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:84%
is Canis lupus familiaris and
we add that trinomial part,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that last epithet to
its name to designate

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:90%
that it's been domesticated.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that as
something's moved away

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
from wild nature, and
its diet has changed,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and its environmental
conditions are changed,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly, probably,
sexual selection becomes

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.310 align:middle line:90%
a factor.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
We think a lot about
natural selection,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:90%
how the environment shapes us.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
What we forget is the
incredible power wielded usually

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
by females of a species to
select mates that will drive

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:90%
radical changes in phenotypes.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So you look at some
of the bird species,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
let's say, in the
Amazon and you think

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
how did natural selection
choose these radical colors

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:90%
and feather designs?

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.813 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not-- that's
not natural selection, not

00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
the environment, that's
selection by females of mates.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, with domestication, we
get into artificial selection.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:90%
So we change the environment.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's no longer
natural selection,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not the
environmental pressure,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
and we become the
sexual selectors,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:90%
who we want to breed.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And, over time, we can in
actually a fairly short period

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
of biological time--
we can take a gray wolf

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:90%
and turn it to a chihuahua.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We've done that with
a lot of species.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
We've done that with cows,
and sheeps, and goats,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and we've done that
with a host of plants.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
We're working on mushrooms,
and bacteria, and algaes,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and all these things right
now, domesticating the world.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:90%
In the process--

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.948 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we ever set out
to domesticate ourselves--

00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:23.740 align:middle line:84%
but, in the process,
we did, inadvertently,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.483 align:middle line:90%
domesticate ourselves.

00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It's important to understand the
timeline that this has happened

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:90%
in because human beings--

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
we get new archeological
evidence all the time.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And now genomics and
genetics has shown us--

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
we're able to peer a little
bit deeper into our origins.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:84%
But we know that we're at least,
in our current form-- we're

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
something like
300,000 years old.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
All right, we've been
around for $300,000 years

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.560 align:middle line:90%
as modern humans.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
But humans as a genus, genus
Homo, goes back a lot farther

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and all of us were
hunter-gatherers.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:90%
That's our wild type.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.300 align:middle line:84%
Most of us only interact
with human beings

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:90%
of the domestic type.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But the wild type
hunts and gathers.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.860 align:middle line:84%
It's something like
10,000 years ago,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:84%
some would say 14,000 years
ago, 11,000 years ago.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Something between
10,000 and 14,000 years

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
ago, human beings started
in the Fertile Crescent

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.240 align:middle line:90%
started to plant things.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
We started-- we went from this
idea of tending to the wild--

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and this is not a like surviving
hand-to-mouth kind of a thing.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
People had gotten very good
at getting food resources out

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:84%
of their environment
and also interacting

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
with the environment to
make it more productive.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.750 align:middle line:90%
We tended the wild.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:84%
We were gardeners of
the wild landscape.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:84%
But this idea to start
planting starts around 10,000

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:90%
to 14,000 years ago.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly we shift away
from being hunter-gatherers

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:84%
in that area of the
world to being domestic,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:84%
to starting-- going away from
this idea of annual migration

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:84%
routes through our
range, where we would

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
go from our sort of winter
camp to our spring camp

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:84%
to our summer camp, following
migrations of animals,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:84%
following the
ripening of plants,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:84%
getting away from insects like
mosquitos and things like.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
You learn, OK, in the summer,
we don't want to be down here.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go up here.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.287 align:middle line:84%
But once we start
planting, now we

00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:90%
need to kind of guard that area.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.720 align:middle line:90%
We need to weed it.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.938 align:middle line:90%
We need to till it.

00:05:14.938 --> 00:05:16.480 align:middle line:84%
We need to keep
animals away from it.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:84%
So people start to settle down
and this is the first time

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.373 align:middle line:90%
that we become sedentary.

00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Because prior to that,
we're not of the house.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, domestication
means "of the household."

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:90%
We weren't of the house.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
We might have been of the
tent because we'd bring things

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
with us, but for the first time
people start settling down.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Very quickly, shockingly fast
out of that starts to emerge.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:90%
the city-states.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
About 6,000, 7,000 years
ago we start seeing

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:90%
the first city-states emerge.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And what we have now
is enough surplus food

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
to create an environment where
you can have a class of people

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
who can sit at the top and
not have to forage anymore,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.698 align:middle line:90%
not have to hunt anymore.

00:05:52.698 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
In a hunter-gatherer
community, everybody's

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
like a sovereign individual
and it's an egalitarian system,

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
everyone does overlapping
jobs to make sure

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:90%
that everyone's fed.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Everybody forages,
everybody hunts.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:84%
The chief does and the
runt of the litter does.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Everybody participates
equally and together.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
But now you have
this system where,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
through growing
grains primarily.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
In Mesopotamia we're
talking about wheat.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But if we get over to
Asia, another center

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:84%
of domestication, we're
talking about rice.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.397 align:middle line:84%
If we go to-- over
to Mesoamerica,

00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:84%
we see another center
of domestication

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:84%
that arises later
based around maize,

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.757 align:middle line:90%
or what we now call corn.

00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have several
centers of domestication,

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:84%
but they tend to focus
on growing up grass.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
So all those plants I just
mentioned wheat, barley

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
is another one, rice, corn,
those are all grasses.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.430 align:middle line:84%
They're seeds we call grains
and we can produce surplus food

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.230 align:middle line:90%
by doing that.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first time
human beings have more food

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:90%
than they can eat.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Hunter-gatherers tend to have
this sort of daily subsistence

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:90%
or weekly subsistence.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like we harvest
enough for what we need

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and, as it runs down, we
go out we get more of it.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
The hunters go out when the meat
resource starts to be depleted.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
The foragers go out when
the plant resource--

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
some is stored-- but lots of
it's just sort of eaten up.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
But for the first time now we
have all this surplus grain

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:90%
and now we can feed more people.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So immediately what happens
is the population starts

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
to grow because people are
made out of-- turns out

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.758 align:middle line:90%
we're made out of food.

00:07:18.758 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing that
I think a lot of people

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.600 align:middle line:90%
don't understand.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
They talk about and
think about how we

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:90%
deal with a population problem.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:84%
If you keep adding surplus
food into any population,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.510 align:middle line:84%
you'll have a population
problem, barring that you

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:90%
somehow sterilize individuals.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people will
continue to reproduce

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.340 align:middle line:84%
because there's enough surplus
carbon to make more people.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And so you start to
have people settle down

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and then quickly they
start to grow and multiply.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to
get a stratified society

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.595 align:middle line:84%
because you need somebody to
sort of watch over the grain.

00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you need
somebody to determine

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.667 align:middle line:90%
how to distribute the grain.

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you got to start
having rules about that.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got to have sort
of a legal class and, well,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:90%
how do you enforce that?

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, now you need
an enforcement class?

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.707 align:middle line:84%
Well, who sits on
the top of that?

00:08:00.707 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
You start to quickly develop a
hierarchical system, which is

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:90%
not our natural way of living.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way that
for dogs, let's say--

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
for dogs interacting in
a household environment

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.700 align:middle line:90%
like-- a wolf is a pack animal.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
We say lone wolf sometimes,
but there aren't really

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:90%
lone wolves.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:84%
There might be lone
coyotes, but wolves no.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:90%
They are a pack animal.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:90%
They're a social animal.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:84%
This idea of a dog
living alone in a house

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
with a couple of people,
not normal for dogs.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Can work, but not normal
for dogs biologically.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
That's not their
biological norm.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Living in a hierarchical
structure where

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
you have a ruling class, and
a policing and military class,

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.257 align:middle line:84%
and a educational
class, and then you

00:08:38.257 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
get down to a sort of
a worker class, that's

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:90%
not our natural way of being.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
We can make it work
to some degree,

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:84%
but that's not our
biological norm.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's what came
out of domestication.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
This all starts like
10,000 years ago.

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.212 align:middle line:84%
So, again, if we
took this timeline--

00:08:51.212 --> 00:08:56.380 align:middle line:84%
here's 300,000 years and this
whole time we hunt and gather

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.045 align:middle line:90%
and then 10,000 years ago--

00:08:59.045 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's not like
10,000 years ago-- we

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
call this thing the Neolithic
Revolution, the first planting,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
it makes it sound like it just
caught fire and went around

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.662 align:middle line:84%
I would point out that this is
not even a complete revolution

00:09:09.662 --> 00:09:10.678 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:84%
There are people
all around the world

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:90%
still hunting and gathering.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.998 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
people like myself

00:09:14.998 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
who've taken it on
as a modern practice,

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
but I mean true
subsistence hunters

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and gatherers like we would
find some in the Amazon, what

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.103 align:middle line:90%
we call the uncontacted tribes.

00:09:23.103 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:84%
We'd find some in
New Guinea, we'd

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
find some in Africa,
that have not

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
bought into the
agricultural model yet.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:90%
We're very close.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's like-- it hurts to
say it, but in my lifetime,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
they'll probably
be no more true,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.970 align:middle line:84%
wild subsistence lineages
left in the world.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're all
shifting over now

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:84%
as they're drawn into or
voluntarily come into what

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:90%
we call the modern world.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like
10,000 years ago

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
everybody on the planet
switched to this, just in just

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.917 align:middle line:90%
in this one area.

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And then that started
to spread there,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and then crops up in Peru,
it crops up in Mexico,

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
it crops up in Asia, and you
get these domestication centers.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.255 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they tend to
do is need more land.

00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:84%
They're growing
their population.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:84%
They go out, they conquest,
they take more land,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
but this happens slowly and
we're not even fully there yet.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So when we look
at that timeline,

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
when did humans
get domesticated?

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's like right here
some humans did in this 300,000

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:84%
your timeline and then that's
not even all of them until--

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
we're almost there.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:84%
It's basically happened
yesterday in biological terms.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
We are not yet adapted
to living this way.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know
how to live this way.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
The pace of
technology is so fast

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
that our-- biologically we
can't stay up to speed with it.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:90%
We're trying, but we--

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:90%
things keep changing.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
We got domesticated and
didn't even realize it.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But unlike a dog,
we wear more of

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.130 align:middle line:84%
like an invisible kind of
collar and an invisible leash.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like an unseen
hand, where the dog knows

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.580 align:middle line:84%
you're the master, telling
it what it can and can't do,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.470 align:middle line:84%
setting the rules,
and feeding it.

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But we sort of
have like-- we have

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:84%
a sense in our culture
of our freedom,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:84%
but we're much more
like free range cattle

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
than we are like
free human beings.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
saying, the next step

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:84%
after free range is in freedom,
it's the slaughterhouse.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
We don't raise
ourselves for meat.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't eat people, thankfully.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But we certainly raise
ourselves for the labor force.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:90%
That's kind of what we do.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:84%
We live on like a human
factory farm in a way,

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.937 align:middle line:84%
raised up for the labor force,
told that if we work hard

00:11:28.937 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:90%
we'll have some kind of freedom.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, we all
know as we become adults,

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.310 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like a trap
and that you can't ever

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
really get free.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It's more fair to
say we're free range.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So at this point,
human domestication

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:84%
is 7 billion
people, most of whom

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
live on like a giant
human factory farm.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:90%
In some places.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:90%
It's more like a CAFO.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.997 align:middle line:90%
Some parts of the world--

00:11:50.997 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we call that
the third world or we

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
call that the developing world,
where they're struggling.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:84%
It's much harder, there's
a lot less freedom to move.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And then some
places where we in--

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:84%
like in the more
developed nations

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.462 align:middle line:84%
where people have the sense
of all this economic freedom,

00:12:04.462 --> 00:12:06.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd say it's more like
a really nice free range

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:84%
farm, the one you want
to see on the box of eggs

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:84%
when you get them, the pasture
where we can move about freely,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have
the true freedom

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.490 align:middle line:84%
that hunter-gatherers
had and that's

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.198 align:middle line:84%
the kind of freedom
most of us can't even

00:12:17.198 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:90%
really imagine anymore.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> This comes, obviously,
with side effects.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
You look at a pug dog and it
can hardly breathe, it's got--

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
it has issues where you look
at a certain dog that gets--

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.470 align:middle line:84%
always gets hip issues
or something and that's

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
because they're
genetically not pure.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the side effects

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.638 align:middle line:84%
that the human species
are experiencing

00:12:39.638 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
because of this sort
of domestication

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:90%
that you've explained?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It's funny, it's actually
because they are genetically

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:90%
poor--

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.322 align:middle line:84%
I want to just kind of
reframe that just a little bit

00:12:48.322 --> 00:12:50.280 align:middle line:84%
because you start-- when
you start to use terms

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.363 align:middle line:84%
like genetic purity, it's
like, ooh, we're getting

00:12:52.363 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:90%
into some sticky territory.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's led to some
weird places in the past.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about a
purebred dog, the dog that

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.190 align:middle line:84%
comes with papers, the dog that
can get into the kennel club,

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
that's actually a very
genetically weak animal.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:84%
It's come from a very
restricted gene pool.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:90%
So this is not a well--

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:84%
this is not an animal with
a lot of room to adapt.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It can't go to this side of
the pool, the shallow side

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:90%
or the deep side.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:90%
It's in the shallow side.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.013 align:middle line:84%
So if it was a German
shepherd, as you brought up,

00:13:20.013 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to end
up with hip dysplasia

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:84%
almost every time,
you just kind of know

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.072 align:middle line:84%
what it's going to end up
with, or you brought up

00:13:26.072 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
pugs where they're their entire
face has been sort of crushed

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
forward, they can't
breathe anymore.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.342 align:middle line:84%
These are artifacts of
this sexual selection

00:13:33.342 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:90%
we were talking about before.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So somebody says I like a German
shepherd with hips that are

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:84%
lower than its shoulder
blades, let's say,

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and over time if you look at
pictures of German shepherds 50

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:84%
years ago, 60
years ago to today,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that
they've gotten that's--

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:53.653 align:middle line:84%
that aesthetic that people
in the German shepherd

00:13:53.653 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:90%
has been selected for.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.313 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this female has it and this
male has it, let's breed them.

00:13:57.313 --> 00:13:59.355 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now let's take puppies
and keep breeding that

00:13:59.355 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and keep breeding that.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So as we've done that, we've
ended up with these animals who

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
have all of these
artifacts, these

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
features that actually
impact their health.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing that in
ourselves as well,

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:84%
but we're actually way more
willy-nilly with our own

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:90%
breeding than we are with--

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.563 align:middle line:84%
and, again, this is
delicate territory.

00:14:16.563 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the eugenics
programs that happened

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and that we fought
a world war over.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we want to
bring in sort of a regulation

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:84%
on how we breed,
but some of us can

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
be more thoughtful at an
individual level about what

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:90%
we're choosing.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
What we've ended up with
is a lot of these artifacts

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:90%
as well like--

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.640 align:middle line:84%
it's now considered
quite normal for people

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to need dental work because
their teeth no longer fit

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:90%
into their mouth.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that doesn't exist

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:84%
in hunter-gatherer cultures
where they have lived there

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.948 align:middle line:90%
intact traditional lifeway.

00:14:47.948 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:84%
That's hard for people
to hear because what

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:84%
they see a lot of times on TV
are people whose lives have

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.925 align:middle line:84%
been very-- we'll see a
hunter-gatherer group,

00:14:54.925 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
but they're actually living
on a lot of wheat, and sugar,

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and corn, or
something like that.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
The UN has brought in
a lot of Western foods,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.488 align:middle line:84%
their lifestyle has
changed, and now

00:15:03.488 --> 00:15:06.030 align:middle line:84%
they are the recipients of many
of these dental problems too.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.447 align:middle line:84%
But traditionally,
especially when

00:15:07.447 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
we look at our
fossil record, we see

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.027 align:middle line:84%
that this idea of needing
braces for our teeth

00:15:11.027 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to fit in our mouth,
that's like the pug who

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:90%
can't breed anymore.

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.425 align:middle line:90%
That's not natural to us.

00:15:15.425 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you go back
in the fossil record,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.092 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that's
really fascinating

00:15:19.092 --> 00:15:21.518 align:middle line:84%
is that when we see that early
domestication that happened

00:15:21.518 --> 00:15:23.310 align:middle line:84%
in the Fertile Crescent
I was talking about

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.313 align:middle line:84%
is there was an immediate
reduction in height,

00:15:25.313 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
there was immediate
reduction in bone density.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:84%
We start to see
scarring on the bones,

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
we start to see impacts
of boom-bust cycles

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:90%
of agriculture.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So people have a year of
no food and then a year

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:84%
of lots of food, whereas
hunter-gatherers have,

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
because they have so
many plant and animal

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:84%
resources they can draw upon,
they have steady nutrition

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
but not so much in traditional
agricultural societies

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:90%
where they would have droughts.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Droughts don't affect
hunter-gatherers so much.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
you just-- the wild
plants still grow.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this plant's
not as available,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
but we know 40 other ones
that we can use in a pinch.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Whereas agriculturists put
all the eggs in one basket

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:84%
so to say or we say all
the seeds in one plot.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And if that doesn't
work out, now you're

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
boiling your leather
belt for food

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
because you've got
nothing to eat.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So that will lead to
weak enamel in the teeth

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:90%
and it'll lead to weak bones.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
We actually see a brain
case size reduction

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:90%
in the fossil record as well.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.122 align:middle line:84%
So there's some indication that
we might have actually become

00:16:20.122 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:90%
somewhat less intelligent.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:84%
There is a tendency to
think of ourselves right now

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
as the smartest
we have ever been.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's
really in question

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
because if we could go back
that 100,000, 200,000 years ago,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:90%
these are humans.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:84%
This is somebody-- you can run
them through a pilot school

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.368 align:middle line:90%
and they could fly a jumbo jet.

00:16:38.368 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think like,
oh, this is somebody

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:90%
dragging knuckles in the cave.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.840 align:middle line:84%
No, these are humans
as intelligent as us

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
but far more adapted
to the environment

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
far more integrated
into the environment

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.400 align:middle line:90%
and actually healthier than us.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
One of-- probably the
biggest takeaway from this

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:84%
is that we have all of
these chronic diseases that

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:84%
don't show up in people who
live a traditional lifeway

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:90%
on the landscape.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
That's things like cancer, heart
disease, diabetes, obesity.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So many of the things that
are headline news all the time

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:90%
weren't really serious problems.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they
never existed,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:84%
but they existed in
numbers that made

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:90%
them like almost negligible.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're dealing
with a lot of this.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's benefits
to our lifestyle.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I don't mean
to act like there aren't.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is that
we have greater longevity

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.807 align:middle line:90%
and the other one would be--

00:17:29.807 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:90%
I can think of two--

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:84%
aside from all the comforts,
of course, we have comfort.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.580 align:middle line:84%
We no longer worry about like
I'm going to walk outside

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and I have to think about
predators that might eat me.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
That's an actual real
thing that people

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
deal with if they live out
in natural environments.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But the two main things that
we have are increased longevity

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.153 align:middle line:84%
and we have much
less child mortality.

00:17:56.153 --> 00:17:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to
address those individually

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.073 align:middle line:84%
because they sound
like, oh, well,

00:18:00.073 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
then that the
deal's sealed, we're

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:90%
doing this agricultural thing.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.643 align:middle line:84%
We're going full
domestication because we're

00:18:04.643 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:84%
going to live longer and our
kids are going to survive.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:90%
The normal-- this is--

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.970 align:middle line:84%
again, this is like
hard for people to hear,

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
but the normal mortality
rate for children

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.440 align:middle line:90%
is something about like 50%.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:90%
That's just normal for humans.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
This is normal for lots of
animals, lots of animals.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:90%
You look at an animal like--

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
you catch a fish and it's got
a roe sac and you're like, wow,

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:90%
there's 30,000 eggs in there.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Why 30,000 eggs?

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Because almost none of
those fertilized eggs

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.390 align:middle line:84%
will actually
survive to adulthood.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is free
cast out as many larva

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:84%
as you can because
very few will make it.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Humans have a much different
strategy, of course.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It takes a long
time to raise a kid.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.085 align:middle line:84%
It takes a tremendous
amount of effort.

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
They come out not very well
prepared for the environment.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have to put a
lot of investment in,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
but it was very normal
for kids to die.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that when you take
a high child mortality rate

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and you try to create
an average lifespan,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:84%
it makes the average
life span sound

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot smaller than what a person
who is an adult would live to.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So you'll hear, oh, our
ancestors only lived to 30.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no,
that's ridiculous.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.240 align:middle line:84%
If you take out all of
this child mortality,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.863 align:middle line:84%
you start to see if you
make it to adulthood,

00:19:16.863 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
your chances are that you're
going to live a healthy, very

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:90%
long life.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect and this came
from interviewing a person who

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
researches archeological
grave sites

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
and she told me that
they can't really

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.240 align:middle line:90%
date human bones past age 55.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So what happens
is when you might

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
be looking at an 80-year-old
body, but you'll call it 55.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you take a
55-year-old maximum lifespan

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and you take this
high child mortality,

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
it makes it appear that
our ancestors didn't

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:90%
live very long.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:84%
They had the same kind
of life spans as us,

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.680 align:middle line:84%
but, on average, more
of us make it longer.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:90%
That's also true in zoos.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So if we take an animal from the
wild and we put it in a zoo--

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
if we took a deer,
for instance--

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
if you got a five, six,
seven-year-old deer here,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:84%
that's incredible
because most of them

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:84%
aren't going to
make it that long.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
environment's difficult,

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a high
winter kill, there's

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.290 align:middle line:84%
predation by people and
other animals, hunters

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.585 align:middle line:90%
and other animals.

00:20:21.585 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't typically
make it that long.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.002 align:middle line:84%
But if we put them in
a zoo with these kind

00:20:25.002 --> 00:20:27.370 align:middle line:84%
of ideal conditions,
soft conditions,

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.690 align:middle line:90%
they'll live a lot longer.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
We do have to ask
ourselves would

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.270 align:middle line:84%
that deer prefer to live
in a zoo or live freely.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Would the average gorilla
prefer to be in an enclosure

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:90%
or would it prefer to be free?

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
If you told me that I can
be free on the landscape

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to
live 10 less years

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:84%
or I could live in
confinement but I

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.880 align:middle line:84%
could have 10 more years of
confinement and especially

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:84%
if those last 10 were going
to be heavily drugged,

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and constant medical
problems, and pain, and all

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:84%
those kind of things, it's
like there might be ben--

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that longevity might not
be a panacea, might not

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.267 align:middle line:90%
be as great as it sounds.

00:21:05.267 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:84%
The other thing with
child mortality--

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.090 align:middle line:84%
this is a challenging one and I
want to be really upfront here.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced
reproductive grief myself.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.218 align:middle line:84%
I have lost nephews and
nieces to child mortality.

00:21:18.218 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
friends who've lost--

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
like several friends who've
lost children from everything

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:84%
from before they were
born, to the day they were

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
born to 30 days
late, even friends

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.490 align:middle line:90%
who lost the baby at one year.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:90%
So I understand.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
this casually or--

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not trying
to be cavalier.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that we
have now a worldwide population

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.080 align:middle line:90%
crisis.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.310 align:middle line:84%
We're all freaking
out about this

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
because we know the
population grows exponentially

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and there's not enough
resources for all the people.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And the reason-- one big
reason this is happening

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.040 align:middle line:84%
is because almost all our
kids make it to adulthood.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:90%
So this has created a crisis.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that when
you look at which individuals

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.128 align:middle line:84%
in a population of, let's say,
wild animals get weeded out

00:22:05.128 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:90%
and don't make it to adulthood.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a natural
selection system

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.495 align:middle line:84%
that ensures strengthen
the genetic population.

00:22:11.495 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And it will reduce many of those
problems we were talking about

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:84%
before, where genetic artifacts
that would be weeded out

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:84%
by natural selection
by death, essentially

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.920 align:middle line:84%
make it into the population
and, therefore, weaken

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:90%
the population at large.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
This is delicate
stuff to talk about.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
But I think-- it's not delicate
to talk about with any animal.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just delicate
talk about people.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:84%
So if we were going to
put on our biologist hat

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and we were going to speak
about humans biologically,

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
we'd be like, oh, yeah,
this is probably not good

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that so many individuals, many
whom are really sick, or really

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
weak, or having a
failure to thrive,

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
go on to be reproductive
adults later.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
That was not a
problem there, so it

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.950 align:middle line:84%
kept hunter-gatherer
populations very strong.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:84%
We are incredibly insulated
from death in our culture

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
so we're not used to dealing
with anything like that.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like taboo
even to see death.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Whereas indigenous folks
would have been like,

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:90%
yep, lost that one--

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
not like there's no grief,
but it was more normal.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It was it was a
normal occurrence.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Even infanticide after
a child is born--

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
if let's say a
woman's had a child

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and her husband is killed, let's
say, in a hunting accident,

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:84%
it was not unheard
of to let that baby

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:84%
die because you know
that you did not

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
have the resources
to raise that child.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, all our kids
make it more than

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
can be parented by the
parents biologically.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.242 align:middle line:84%
We have so many kids
and our population

00:23:38.242 --> 00:23:39.450 align:middle line:90%
is growing, growing, growing.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.033 align:middle line:84%
So these two things
that domestication

00:23:41.033 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
has given us has made
life a little easier

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.540 align:middle line:90%
emotionally in some regards.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.110 align:middle line:90%
But it's certainly created--

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.370 align:middle line:84%
it's a Pandora's box
and we've opened it

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.732 align:middle line:84%
and there's problems
that come with that.

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And we can't undo it now.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're on
this path, right?

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:90%
I know, right?

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
you bring because I

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.480 align:middle line:84%
look at some really indigenous
cultures around the world.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And these things you
mention are normal for them

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
to consider population
control with resources.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
How they manage
the environment is

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
totally different than how
we look at the environment,

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.110 align:middle line:84%
because they consider
themselves of the environment.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.600 align:middle line:90%
So they are nature.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So they live in nature
and they commune with it.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, we have somewhat
sort of separated ourselves

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:90%
from nature.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:31.160 align:middle line:84%
We cut it up, divided a gene
splice that and sort of like--

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> We're just getting started.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.843 align:middle line:90%
>> We're just getting under way.

00:24:34.843 --> 00:24:36.640 align:middle line:90%
And you know this as well.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like there's the
number of indigenous peoples

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:84%
that were in the world and
are in the world, the number

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
of languages and
language groups.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.600 align:middle line:90%
And you can't say--

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:84%
it's tempting to say, and
I say it all the time,

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.577 align:middle line:90%
well, the indigenous people.

00:24:50.577 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like which ones and
who are we talking about?

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
things that we

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.620 align:middle line:84%
can see that are sort of
trans cultural and ubiquitous.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
There's this sort of way of
seeing the environment you

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.110 align:middle line:84%
were just alluding to,
which is like, well, there's

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:90%
human people.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.143 align:middle line:84%
But then there's like
the deer people, right?

00:25:09.143 --> 00:25:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Or the giraffe,
people or whatever

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:84%
is like this personage
to living creatures.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:90%
It's not humans.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And then everything else is like
a thing that you can just take,

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
like everything's just a blank
noun that you can just take,

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.660 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it's this understanding
that we're a type of animal,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.553 align:middle line:84%
or it might be more fair to save
with a lot of natural peoples

00:25:29.553 --> 00:25:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that it'd be like more we're
like a spiritual entity

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:90%
on this--

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:90%
in this place.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:90%
And so are these other beings.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, there's
a built-in respect

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that our monotheistic
religions didn't necessarily

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:90%
instill into us culturally.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And that might not have
been a problem initially

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:84%
when we were small
enough, but now that we

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:84%
have scaled out and
covered the globe,

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
now it's a real
problem if we interact

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:90%
with the environment like that.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.800 align:middle line:84%
If we continue to interact with
the environment like everything

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.090 align:middle line:84%
here is a spiritless
resource, or a resource

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.090 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't require
respect, or if it's only

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.703 align:middle line:90%
seen in an economic way.

00:26:05.703 --> 00:26:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- we're
starting to see that change,

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's good, but
it's not enough.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.405 align:middle line:84%
It won't-- I don't
think it will keep pace.

00:26:12.405 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:84%
It would be like,
well, we're not

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.360 align:middle line:84%
going to see trees as
like living creatures,

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
even though they are, right?

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:24.182 align:middle line:84%
Or beings, even though
technically they are beings.

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we'll see them
as an economic resource

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and we'll think about
it like a bank account.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Like let's not spend more trees
than we're growing so that we

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:31.660 align:middle line:90%
never hit negative, right?

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't ever want
to go into the red.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.890 align:middle line:84%
That's-- that will lead to
more trees at some level.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's-- I don't
think it's enough.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly
not enough in here

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:84%
where we truly
feel an emptiness.

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:90%
Because we're lonesome.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember, lonesome,
it's like, thank

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:84%
goodness we have a
best friend, dogs.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Another domesticated animal.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, right, like us
and our dogs and our cats,

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
we're pretty lonely in
the world because we

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:01.510 align:middle line:84%
have created a relationship
of emotional isolation

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:90%
from our environment.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it like
this if we were to say,

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:84%
let's say we were going to go
to a trekking party, like let's

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.960 align:middle line:84%
say some westerners
from the UK, Europe,

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and the states are going
trekking in the Himalaya.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd grab like some
indigenous folks who are

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.190 align:middle line:90%
living a traditional life way.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.607 align:middle line:84%
So I'm talking
about some of these

00:27:25.607 --> 00:27:27.040 align:middle line:90%
like more uncontacted tribes.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And we look at the
two side by side.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.380 align:middle line:84%
For sure, the trekkers look
like-- almost like astronauts

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
indigenous people who

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.730 align:middle line:84%
look much more like
a type of animal

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:84%
on the landscape, a
tool using animal.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.170 align:middle line:90%
So unique, right?

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:84%
One that has the ability
with both brain and digits

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:90%
to manipulate the environment.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So certainly, we're
a special animal.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:90%
We're unique.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But they look like
part of the landscape.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
We are enclosed in
tech fabrics, boots

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that insulate us from the
ground, packs full of stuff.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
You put an astronaut like
from the Apollo moon landing

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
here and put the tracker here
and the indigenous person here,

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.213 align:middle line:84%
who does the trekker
look more like?

00:28:06.213 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They look more
like the astronaut.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.000 align:middle line:84%
The amount of equipment
necessary for us to just go

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:84%
into the environment
is a testament

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.130 align:middle line:84%
to how domesticated
we've become and how

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.100 align:middle line:84%
isolated we are that we need
to carry life support with us,

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:84%
like as if we're going
to the moon or to Mars

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:84%
but we're actually
on our own planet.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know how to
use the resources that

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:84%
are available to us, so we
have to bring them all in.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And it gets complicated
because now we

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.380 align:middle line:84%
have in the west here
this idea of a leave

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.838 align:middle line:84%
no trace ethic in
going into nature.

00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So that was something
I grew up with,

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:84%
which is like, if
you're going to go into,

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.307 align:middle line:84%
let's say the National Forest
here where you guys just

00:28:41.307 --> 00:28:43.390 align:middle line:84%
came from, if we're going
to go into that National

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Forest, the idea is, don't
start a fire with wood.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Bring your camp stove.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And that seems good because
you'll see less damage

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:90%
to the landscape initially.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But it also means that somewhere
they have to mine the propane,

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and then somewhere they
have to bottle the propane

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.730 align:middle line:90%
into these aluminum containers.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And somebody has to manufacture
the stove in a factory,

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and all this pollution that
comes out of that just so I

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.750 align:middle line:84%
cannot damage the
nature that I go into.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.108 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, you
can damage that nature.

00:29:07.108 --> 00:29:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But let's leave this
nature pristine.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have this very, it's
sort of like, you'll see--

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it said,
and I can't speak

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.188 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of First
Nations People

00:29:18.188 --> 00:29:20.230 align:middle line:84%
or Native American people
here on this continent.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:90%
I won't try to.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But I have heard a sentiment
echoed several times.

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:30.608 align:middle line:84%
When people from our culture
see the reservations,

00:29:30.608 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and they'll see what looks
like a lot of garbage,

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it'll be like
cars rusting out over here,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:84%
plastic strewn about in people's
yards and stuff, and be like,

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and why do they not
just clean that up?

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.130 align:middle line:90%
And for them, what--

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.930 align:middle line:84%
again, I've heard
this said and echoed

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.910 align:middle line:84%
several times it's
like, you guys just

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:50.170 align:middle line:84%
think that if you go bury
it over there, it goes away.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And we don't think
like that, right?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have this idea that,
well, we have designated

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:90%
this for destruction.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:84%
We'll put all this
stuff there so we can

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:90%
keep this looking really clean.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like a shell game.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.100 align:middle line:84%
We just keep moving stuff
around, forgetting that, hey,

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
the environment's one
contiguous interconnected thing.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is a testament to
how we relate to it, right?

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, I want to
keep my face really pretty,

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.760 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to scratch up and
cut up my legs or something.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like that's--
it's all one body.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And we live on that body and
we're interacting with it.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Like we came from
another planet.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And we're not from here.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.865 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
anywhere else to go.

00:30:28.865 --> 00:30:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think that's
important for people to get.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.625 align:middle line:84%
This idea of like a lunar
base or a trip to Mars,

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking
about something

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:90%
that's going on next week.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.910 align:middle line:90%
We have no backup plan here.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.840 align:middle line:90%
This is the home.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the placenta,
or whatever.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:45.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the womb, like we--
this Earth is what we have.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know if we
could survive out there.

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:84%
It's extremely unrealistic that
that's how our future goes,

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.130 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.210 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the rise and fall
of civilizations through time,

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:90%
it's very unrealistic.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:90%
The probability is low.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.773 align:middle line:84%
We need to bank on
protecting this place,

00:31:04.773 --> 00:31:07.065 align:middle line:84%
not running somewhere else
and then destroying that one

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:08.790 align:middle line:90%
and going to the next one.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.320 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to
do that, we need

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.737 align:middle line:84%
to have a different
ethic with how

00:31:11.737 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:90%
we interact with the landscape.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to come
from just recycling and trying

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to do leave no trace
in the environment.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.390 align:middle line:84%
It's got to come
from people having

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:84%
meaningful interactions with
the landscape that can't

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.653 align:middle line:90%
be replaced by something else.

00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You could look at
what I do, which

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:90%
is hunt, fish, and forage food.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can think like it's a
hobby, because I don't really

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:90%
need to.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I can go right down
to the supermarket.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.690 align:middle line:90%
I have the resources.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I have a vehicle.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I have the money to go
buy all my food if I want.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.400 align:middle line:84%
But I choose to hunt,
fish and forage.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
It looks to some people
like it's my hobby.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh, it's just
golf, or Frisbee,

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.840 align:middle line:90%
or whatever other hobby.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And for me it's like,
no, it's not that.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not a sport.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.287 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the best way
to say it's like a practice.

00:32:00.287 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Most people who meditate don't
think of their meditation

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:90%
as a sport, right?

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.560 align:middle line:84%
They don't think of their
yoga, usually, as a sport.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a practice, right?

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline
to show up and do it.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, harvesting and
processing your own food

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.070 align:middle line:90%
takes quite a lot of discipline.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.580 align:middle line:90%
It provides subsistence.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:90%
It provides calories for me.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But I spend probably
sometimes more resources

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.680 align:middle line:90%
doing it than I actually get.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really subsistence,
and it's not really

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.510 align:middle line:90%
a sport or a hobby.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:32.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a practice that alters
how I interact with landscapes.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Now when I move
through landscapes,

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:90%
these are like a kitchen to me.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like an extension of me.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.590 align:middle line:90%
It's part of my home.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:44.300 align:middle line:84%
If Walmart wants to put
a store into a landscape

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.010 align:middle line:84%
where I harvest food, who's the
first person out there to say,

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:52.000 align:middle line:84%
hey, no, this place needs
to remain an open space.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Not the environmentalist
back in the city

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.670 align:middle line:84%
who's just actually
using all those resources

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and probably going to
shop at that Walmart.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:06.170 align:middle line:84%
They-- for sure, they believe
in caring for the environment.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:84%
But at such a level
of removal that they

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.715 align:middle line:84%
can fall into these ideas of
like carbon offset credits,

00:33:11.715 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:84%
right, where it's like,
oh, yeah, that makes sense,

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, we'll destroy that but
we'll fix something over here

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Whereas I'm like, no, you can't
destroy, that is important.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:20.410 align:middle line:90%
I fish there.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.270 align:middle line:84%
I hunt there I.
Get my food there.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a stakeholder in
caring for that landscape.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I've noticed
is when people

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:29.620 align:middle line:84%
have these meaningful,
extractive, sustainably

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.712 align:middle line:84%
extractive relationships,
they care about a place.

00:33:31.712 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- where
one of the things about

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.092 align:middle line:84%
indigenous people
when you see what

00:33:36.092 --> 00:33:38.050 align:middle line:84%
happens when they would
be moved, for instance,

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.820 align:middle line:90%
the punishment to the Apache.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Like the Apache were the
last people fighting the US

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.610 align:middle line:90%
government, right?

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were moved
eventually, Geronimo

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of these people
were moved from Arizona

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.500 align:middle line:90%
to Florida.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking
about people who

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.970 align:middle line:84%
are adapted for
countless generations

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to living on this
arid landscape.

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:84%
They know the plants
that are there.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:84%
They know the animals
that are there.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.857 align:middle line:84%
They understand
the seasons there.

00:34:03.857 --> 00:34:05.660 align:middle line:90%
They are of that place.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.860 align:middle line:84%
They're literally
shaped by that place.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you stick them in
the wettest, most humid place.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.449 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
punishment, right?

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:15.429 align:middle line:84%
When you move
peoples around, they

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.040 align:middle line:84%
care-- they are no
longer adapted to place.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.335 align:middle line:90%
And now they suffer.

00:34:19.335 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Most of the reservations
here in the United States,

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:84%
they're not-- it's not as if
they were, oh, well, choose

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:25.750 align:middle line:84%
your prime piece of land
where you get your stuff

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll cordon
that off and you've

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:28.570 align:middle line:90%
got to just hang out there.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.195 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, we're
going to send you

00:34:30.195 --> 00:34:32.050 align:middle line:84%
the badlands, the place
where you guys knew

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
there was no food, and you
knew there was no resources

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.370 align:middle line:90%
to start farming that.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like that's-- and for
me, if you stick me in another

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.947 align:middle line:84%
place, I don't know
the plants there.

00:34:41.947 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the animals there.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I've spent a lot of time,
invested a lot of energy

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.590 align:middle line:90%
into learning this place.

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that a landscape
is not replaceable to me.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.242 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you become a
staunch protector of a place

00:34:54.242 --> 00:34:56.659 align:middle line:84%
once you have a meaningful
interaction with the landscape.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I say meaningful, I
mean like my cells in my body

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.450 align:middle line:84%
contain carbon that come from
100 plants off this landscape

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and a dozen animals that I have
personally harvested and eaten.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.390 align:middle line:84%
I am made of those things,
like I will protect them.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:84%
They're like family
and friends to me.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not like-- it's not the
way people feel about their food

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:90%
at the supermarket.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a foreign
concept, I think.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's really beautifully
said because a lot of people

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.535 align:middle line:90%
can see--

00:35:24.535 --> 00:35:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to go here
with the next question.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.243 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of interest,
a lot of people

00:35:28.243 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:84%
can see this as like, well,
you're killing animals

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.290 align:middle line:84%
or you're doing
this, that's harmful.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
But I remember you said, maybe
as yourself a number of years

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.260 align:middle line:84%
ago, about how a forest that
has meaningful interactions

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.080 align:middle line:84%
with humans can
thrive better and be

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
a more productive environment
because they're helping move

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.630 align:middle line:84%
things around, like
a bird or a bee

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.710 align:middle line:90%
facilitates the environment.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So can humans in a well
assisted what manner.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.373 align:middle line:84%
>> If you think about
animals that manipulate

00:35:57.373 --> 00:35:59.540 align:middle line:84%
their environment, because
like I was saying before,

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.620 align:middle line:90%
we're very unique.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Our brains are incredible.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Our hands are incredible.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's other species
with incredible brains--

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.590 align:middle line:90%
the cetaceans, the whales--

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.955 align:middle line:90%
and dolphins are whales.

00:36:10.955 --> 00:36:14.840 align:middle line:84%
If we're looking at
species of dolphins, orcas,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.240 align:middle line:84%
baling whales,
tooth whales, they

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
have a brain very
similar to ours.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
manipulative digits.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
If you put fingers on a
dolphin, who knows what

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:26.160 align:middle line:90%
they'd be capable of.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.320 align:middle line:84%
They have been-- and then
you could take an animal

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that you wouldn't think of as
intelligent, like a rodent,

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:31.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Most of us think of
the lowly rodents,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:90%
like not so intelligent.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But then you look
at the beaver who

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.170 align:middle line:84%
has this tremendous
engineering ability.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't fully
realize that over here

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.520 align:middle line:84%
because there was like a beaver
apocalypse that took place

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.160 align:middle line:84%
when the trappers
moved from the east,

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.810 align:middle line:84%
west, ahead of the pioneers,
trapping that out for furs

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:90%
for hats and things like that.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But this was a much
wetter landscape.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Because beavers held
water on the landscape

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:84%
by constructing
extremely elaborate dams.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I have beavers living
in the backyard here.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just that
they pile sticks up.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
They excavate mud
and stones, which

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.165 align:middle line:90%
they use in their construction.

00:37:09.165 --> 00:37:11.790 align:middle line:84%
If you go out and pulled-- made
a hole in the dam, the next day

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:90%
it's back, it's fixed.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:84%
They are incredibly studious
about their environment.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:21.840 align:middle line:90%
This is a rodent, right?

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And they know how to
construct dams to hold water

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.583 align:middle line:90%
to create wetland habitats.

00:37:26.583 --> 00:37:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And when we watch what
they do, it's like, oh,

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.840 align:middle line:84%
they create more
species diversity.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.410 align:middle line:84%
They create more edge habitat,
which lots of animals use.

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:84%
They create the wetlands that
bring in migratory birds.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.230 align:middle line:84%
They create ponds that
backfill and trout move in.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just amazing
how they create more habitat.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:46.470 align:middle line:90%
People do this, too.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.120 align:middle line:84%
We are a type of
animal that engineers

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.740 align:middle line:84%
landscapes in such a way even
as indigenous people, right?

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember, pre-agricultural,
pre-industrial indigenous

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:59.610 align:middle line:84%
peoples were burning landscapes
with fire to create open space.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes just to get away
from biting insects, right?

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like you get
into the woods,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:90%
mosquitoes are all over you.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.885 align:middle line:84%
You get out in a field
where there's a breeze

00:38:06.885 --> 00:38:08.590 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you get
a break from that.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you burn a landscape
to bring up new growth.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.808 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when I
foraged blueberries,

00:38:12.808 --> 00:38:14.400 align:middle line:84%
sometimes they'll
burn the plains.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.775 align:middle line:84%
And the next year
the blueberries

00:38:15.775 --> 00:38:17.040 align:middle line:90%
are so much more prolific.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Or the morel mushrooms,
or whatever it is.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:22.080 align:middle line:84%
So they're cutting trees
down for resources.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.200 align:middle line:84%
They're-- think about a lot
of times people imagine that

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle line:84%
for hunter gatherers that they
would have to move because they

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.847 align:middle line:90%
depleted the food resources.

00:38:30.847 --> 00:38:33.180 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually go out
and play with some of this,

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.320 align:middle line:84%
you realize, well, you probably
are actually reducing your fuel

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:90%
before your food.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're
running out of stuff to burn.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Especially prior to metal tools.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:84%
When Europeans came to North
America, it was essentially,

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.590 align:middle line:84%
we could say, the
Stone Age here.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.780 align:middle line:90%
They did not have metal tools.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you are
cutting a tree down

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.760 align:middle line:84%
with an adds that's
a stone head, right?

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.060 align:middle line:90%
You have to make that.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we're not talking
about a cutting blade

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:90%
that you just easily resharpen.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.650 align:middle line:84%
You're more likely
to want to burn

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:05.820 align:middle line:90%
wood that's already fallen.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Wood that's washed up on shore.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Wood that can be snapped
off, lower limbs, things

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.920 align:middle line:84%
like that that are dry on
conifers and things like that.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you
run out of that.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.568 align:middle line:84%
But as you go through
the landscape doing that,

00:39:17.568 --> 00:39:19.020 align:middle line:84%
you start breaking
that stuff off.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:84%
You're opening up
all this space.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Air moves in there.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Animals can now
move through there.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.190 align:middle line:84%
You cut stuff down and
young shoots come up.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And deer moves out--
come in for that stuff.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So we actually
engineer landscapes

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and then we'd move along, and
move along, and move along.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And as we did that, nature
became more productive.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a story I really like
out of the Christian Bible,

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.900 align:middle line:84%
or I guess, out of
the Torah, as well.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.920 align:middle line:84%
This idea that the first
people were put into a garden

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.740 align:middle line:84%
to be the gardeners of it,
to name all the animals,

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and to care for the garden.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's something
really universally true

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.480 align:middle line:84%
in there is that humans,
essentially what we are,

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.920 align:middle line:84%
is the self-aware gardeners
of the wild world.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when we went
down this path of domestication

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.650 align:middle line:90%
that we lost that.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are like the
antithesis of that.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:84%
We have gone from being
gardeners to being

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.980 align:middle line:84%
just like the
harvesters of it, right?

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're eating our
way down the food chain.

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a really scary thing,
like when Europeans first came

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.290 align:middle line:90%
to North America, this was--

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.245 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't
understand the richness.

00:40:27.245 --> 00:40:28.620 align:middle line:84%
They'd come from
a place that had

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:90%
been depleted for 1,000 years.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.180 align:middle line:90%
They get here.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Not only are the force intact,
but the amount of animals

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.350 align:middle line:84%
just that they
almost thought was--

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:42.480 align:middle line:84%
this is just how this
place is, not understanding

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:45.110 align:middle line:84%
that this place had
been kind of gardened

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.090 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years, right?

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Something like the first people
who came to North America

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.780 align:middle line:84%
were thinking probably
14,000 to 20,000 years ago,

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.210 align:middle line:84%
they migrated over
when there was still

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:90%
an ice sheet connect--

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and also those ice sheets had
to drop to the water level.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So the Bering Strait was this
massive open land bridge.

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Not like a narrow land bridge.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.070 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
1,000 miles of land

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.450 align:middle line:90%
that you could walk across.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They came in here,
and they were here,

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.660 align:middle line:84%
kind of for something
like 15,000 years taking

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.460 align:middle line:90%
care of this place.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And Europeans came over
here and just mowed it down

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:17.990 align:middle line:90%
in a couple of centuries.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.883 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:41:18.883 --> 00:41:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But we ate through
the food chain.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So we started off
with the big stuff--

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.210 align:middle line:84%
sperm whales, cod,
stuff like that.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're getting down to where
we're harvesting the seaweeds.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.958 align:middle line:90%
That's all that's left.

00:41:29.958 --> 00:41:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Like we ate down
through it, right?

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:33.568 align:middle line:84%
So it's like an
inverted trophic scale

00:41:33.568 --> 00:41:36.110 align:middle line:84%
where we took all the big stuff,
and then when that was gone,

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:36.920 align:middle line:90%
we took the next thing.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.878 align:middle line:84%
And when that was gone,
we took the next thing.

00:41:38.878 --> 00:41:40.747 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
running out of stuff.

00:41:40.747 --> 00:41:42.080 align:middle line:90%
We're eating our way through it.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.100 align:middle line:84%
We've become the opposite
of what we are meant to be.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So domestication has
turned us into a mirror

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.870 align:middle line:90%
image of our nature.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like we are the what you'd
call, like a photo negative.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.590 align:middle line:84%
We're like the dark version
of what we should be.

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> One interesting thing,
when you talk about that,

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.820 align:middle line:84%
is this depletion of species,
this depletion of food.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.857 align:middle line:84%
I remember something
you mentioned--

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to think-- maybe
it was seven years ago when we

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.630 align:middle line:90%
chatting or six--

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:90%
was how Indigenous people--

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:84%
in different
cultures it depends--

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.810 align:middle line:84%
on average 200, 300, 350
different types of plants--

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.710 align:middle line:84%
interacted with
their environment

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and probably didn't suffer from
the types of mental neuroses

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:90%
that we suffer from.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And then here we are,
domesticated, comfortable,

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
cozy, but we've got
depression, anxiety.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.050 align:middle line:90%
We're screwed up.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:84%
We're eating 10
different plant species.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Most have been
heavily domesticated,

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.580 align:middle line:84%
heavily agriculturally
manipulated.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.880 align:middle line:90%
And we're not thriving.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So people are not
as happy anymore.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I go to a culture like Vanuatu--

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.980 align:middle line:90%
happy people, thriving people.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.550 align:middle line:84%
They live in connection with the
land because their everyday--

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:54.500 align:middle line:90%
their supermarket is the forest.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.960 align:middle line:84%
They go in there, they bring
stuff out, and they come past.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
vibrant, happy people.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And you've got the guy who's the
investment banker in New York

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:84%
City depressed, or anxious, or
suicide rates have increased.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:07.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, hang on.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:84%
This idea that we go and
make money and be successful

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.320 align:middle line:90%
is a full failure.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So what is the solution
to be healthy or happy?

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it to go back, get
barefoot, understand your food,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.260 align:middle line:90%
eat more species of plants?

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:23.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.110 align:middle line:90%
That's your solution, right?

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.000 align:middle line:84%
You're a practical guy,
and you're like, OK,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
go rewild myself.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And I can see you
happy with your life.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.420 align:middle line:90%
You love what you do.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Would you advise that to people
that are stuck and unhappy?

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a few things--

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I want to flesh that out
and tease that apart,

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:40.195 align:middle line:90%
because that's packed.

00:43:40.195 --> 00:43:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you brought up
this piece about happiness,

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.590 align:middle line:84%
because those are some of the
indices we can look at with

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.737 align:middle line:84%
hunter-gatherer people versus
ourselves and see that--

00:43:48.737 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:84%
earlier we talked about
the chronic disease issues

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and the artifacts
of domestication

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.980 align:middle line:84%
that impact our--
and I was talking

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:90%
about on the physical level.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:01.150 align:middle line:84%
On the emotional level,
almost across the--

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:03.560 align:middle line:84%
hunter-gatherers are called
the original affluent people

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.842 align:middle line:90%
by anthropologists.

00:44:05.842 --> 00:44:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Even though they don't have
financial wealth from what they

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.220 align:middle line:84%
do, they live very well,
and they are much happier,

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and their mental health is
so much better than ours.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:17.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's really important.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
like, would you

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.130 align:middle line:84%
like to live 10 more
depressed years or 10

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:24.510 align:middle line:90%
less but happy the whole time--

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and not happy like they
never have hard times.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the resiliency,
emotional resiliency,

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.290 align:middle line:90%
and the lack of mental illness.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.160 align:middle line:84%
This idea of suiciding ourselves
that we see so common now,

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.610 align:middle line:84%
the desperation that I think
comes from this lonesomeness

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.428 align:middle line:84%
from this isolation from
one another and from nature.

00:44:41.428 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Part of it too is
you brought up sort

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:45.400 align:middle line:84%
of the businessman,
who is like, seize

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.920 align:middle line:90%
the world as a zero-sum game.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.508 align:middle line:84%
So I need these resources
because if I don't take them,

00:44:50.508 --> 00:44:52.300 align:middle line:84%
someone else will take
them, and I will not

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.000 align:middle line:84%
have enough resources
because it's a zero-sum game.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Whereas for the indigenous
peoples of the world

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:84%
or the hunter-gatherers of the
world, everything is shared.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And usually, there--
because each society

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:07.150 align:middle line:84%
is different, but usually
embedded within that society

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.910 align:middle line:84%
are a system of sort
of rules and taboos

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:11.982 align:middle line:84%
that make sure that
everyone is taken care of.

00:45:11.982 --> 00:45:14.440 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that some
people don't have higher status

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.380 align:middle line:84%
or that some people are
going to be better hunters.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.050 align:middle line:84%
But here, when I go hunt,
I bring that animal home.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.650 align:middle line:84%
It's mine, and I get to decide
what I want to do with it.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if I brought
it back to a tribe,

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.050 align:middle line:84%
typically it's not the
hunter who gets that.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.312 align:middle line:84%
It's distributed out
amongst the people.

00:45:31.312 --> 00:45:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And usually there's
some system for that,

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a
gift-based system or it's

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.030 align:middle line:84%
a taboo-based
system of it's taboo

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.387 align:middle line:84%
to be arrogant
about your hunting,

00:45:39.387 --> 00:45:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and therefore you don't
want to be seen as someone

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:middle line:90%
who thinks this is yours.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.340 align:middle line:84%
There's always these
systems for that.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So they don't see it
as a zero-sum game,

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:49.570 align:middle line:90%
because it's not one.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.630 align:middle line:84%
There is enough to go around,
but we're not sharing.

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.060 align:middle line:84%
However, there's also
an interesting thing--

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I saw a study--

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I believe this was
either Inuit or Inupiat,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's a northern
tier group in the Arctic

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:84%
where they created,
essentially, a map of data

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.810 align:middle line:84%
points of all these
individuals and families

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and how food was
shared amongst them.

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And so each point
is an individual.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And you see this incredibly
intricate, almost spider

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:20.200 align:middle line:84%
webbing of how food is shared,
how resources are shared.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Then they do the
same thing with money

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:23.660 align:middle line:90%
that comes into the community.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And now you have just
the couple of lines.

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:28.390 align:middle line:84%
People don't share
money the way that they

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:32.530 align:middle line:84%
share natural resources because
money in the economic model

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.080 align:middle line:84%
is much more of a zero-sum
game, like we are talking about.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.205 align:middle line:84%
It isn't something where
it's like, oh, I got $100,

00:46:37.205 --> 00:46:39.880 align:middle line:84%
so I want to make sure
all my friends get $20.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.223 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when I get a deer, I
like to share that meat out.

00:46:43.223 --> 00:46:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
a big part of it,

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:47.560 align:middle line:84%
is that those of us who've been
raised in this economic model

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.400 align:middle line:90%
become--

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.470 align:middle line:90%
we isolate ourselves through--

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to say greed.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.070 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the smart
way to handle money.

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:55.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:58.550 align:middle line:84%
You're being more adapted
to the economic environment.

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.460 align:middle line:84%
So you're fit for
that environment,

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.070 align:middle line:84%
but not fit for
the natural world.

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:06.010 align:middle line:84%
To come back to what
you were talking about--

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for a lot of
people, like if you've

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.830 align:middle line:84%
been living in the city and your
closest experience of nature

00:47:11.830 --> 00:47:15.790 align:middle line:84%
is eating alfalfa
sprouts at the juice bar,

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.850 align:middle line:84%
then it starts with actually
maybe just getting out

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:23.050 align:middle line:84%
in the park and just
getting out into nature.

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Certainly for me
it's been decades

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:29.110 align:middle line:84%
of unwinding this
stuff, confronting a lot

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:90%
of the taboos along the way.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.480 align:middle line:84%
For instance, like you brought
up, just taking your shoes off.

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a tremendous taboo
against taking your shoes off.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:38.530 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every store
has a sign saying

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.340 align:middle line:84%
you can't come in
there if you do that.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's places where
it's considered normal--

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.300 align:middle line:90%
in your shower, on the beach.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you go outside of where
it's normal without your shoes

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.182 align:middle line:84%
on, people start to get
all in a bunch about it.

00:47:53.182 --> 00:47:54.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh-- they're
not used to that.

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a
lot of those that

00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:01.210 align:middle line:84%
keep us from expressing
ourselves as animals.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's our smell.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:04.600 align:middle line:90%
It's our hair.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.278 align:middle line:84%
It's our clothes, and shoes,
and the way that we walk,

00:48:07.278 --> 00:48:08.320 align:middle line:90%
and the way that we talk.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.988 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of taboo in
our culture against wildness.

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can just see this
if you look up the word

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.180 align:middle line:90%
"wild" in the dictionary.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:14.980 align:middle line:90%
It's incredible.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.530 align:middle line:84%
There'll be about 14
entries, depending

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:18.900 align:middle line:90%
on the dictionary you use.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of them will be
about biological wildness,

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.050 align:middle line:90%
a thing in its natural state.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:90%
And the rest are all negative.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:26.750 align:middle line:84%
That was a wild
party last night.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:28.140 align:middle line:90%
It got crazy.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so and so's acting
a little too wild.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that was a wild
storm last night--

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.240 align:middle line:84%
always these negative
connotations to wildness.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.110 align:middle line:84%
We see wildness as a threatening
external force rather than

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:42.700 align:middle line:90%
a thing that we're a part of.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think mentally
unwinding that

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:49.850 align:middle line:84%
is a really important part of
getting back to some sanity.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.410 align:middle line:84%
After that is
starting to develop

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.450 align:middle line:84%
meaningful relationships
with the natural world.

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that comes from
getting to know species.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not so big on--

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:04.100 align:middle line:84%
for taxonomic purposes, I
have no problem breaking

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.903 align:middle line:84%
the world up into animals,
and plants, and fungi,

00:49:06.903 --> 00:49:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria, and algaes, and
all these different kingdoms

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.120 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.670 align:middle line:84%
But functionally, I just
think of them all as species.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I try not to think that
there's something better

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:90%
about an animal than a plant.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.738 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
specieist approach.

00:49:19.738 --> 00:49:21.530 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the issues
that I would take up

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:23.360 align:middle line:84%
with the modern
vegan movement, is

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.400 align:middle line:84%
that it has a tendency to assume
that biologically an animal has

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.170 align:middle line:84%
more inherent value
than a plant, which

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think makes sense at a
biological or spiritual level

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.310 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:35.110 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.450 align:middle line:84%
So I don't care if it's a
plant, or an animal, or fungi.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:41.640 align:middle line:84%
What I want is to have
relationships with the species.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So in my environment,
let's say I know--

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I work with several
dozen plants, animals--

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.170 align:middle line:90%
high dozens, let's say.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those is
like a friend of mine,

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:59.860 align:middle line:84%
except that there is many
specimens of that species.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.252 align:middle line:84%
So we could take a walk
through these woods.

00:50:02.252 --> 00:50:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And let's say you're
not from here,

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:05.418 align:middle line:84%
and you're not familiar
with what's here.

00:50:05.418 --> 00:50:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So everything is just
sort of green and brown,

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.110 align:middle line:90%
going past you.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
something unrelated to nature

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:90%
maybe.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.070 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about your
job or something like that.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the backdrop,
like as if the natural world is

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.810 align:middle line:84%
the stage upon which we
act out the human drama

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.438 align:middle line:90%
versus the place where we live.

00:50:22.438 --> 00:50:24.980 align:middle line:84%
This happens to me all the time,
because I'll take people out

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.640 align:middle line:84%
with me and I'll observe them
seeing just nothing really,

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.110 align:middle line:90%
just it's a blur of green.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing
individuals in that blur.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.280 align:middle line:90%
That's a beech tree.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a birch tree.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.920 align:middle line:90%
That's maple.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just that's maple.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.070 align:middle line:84%
That's maple, whom
all of my sugars

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.040 align:middle line:84%
come from when I make my maple
syrup to provide all my sugar

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.700 align:middle line:90%
resources for the year.

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.500 align:middle line:90%
That's birch.

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:84%
I extract a syrup
from that that I

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:50.600 align:middle line:84%
use to marinate all my fish
in before I smoke them.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And I cut the twigs
to clean my teeth.

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's a host to several
species of mushroom,

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:57.240 align:middle line:90%
like chaga, that I work with.

00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So when I see birches,
it has meaning to me.

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Its bark is the most flammable
thing on the landscape,

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.350 align:middle line:84%
so I use it as a fire
resource all winter long.

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:07.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I see a birch
tree, it's not like,

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.400 align:middle line:90%
oh, just a birch tree.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.050 align:middle line:84%
It has layers and
layers of meaning to me.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And then that's true
of the forbs around me,

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and the grasses around me,
and the species of animals

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.720 align:middle line:90%
that I rely on for food.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.410 align:middle line:84%
It can be frustrating when
somebody says, oh my god, you'd

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:24.210 align:middle line:90%
kill a bear.

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:26.133 align:middle line:90%
That's just so horrible.

00:51:26.133 --> 00:51:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, really?

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I can get
all my fat that I

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:32.420 align:middle line:84%
cook with for the
whole year and probably

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.750 align:middle line:84%
40 meals, which I will
share not just with myself,

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:37.670 align:middle line:90%
but my wife, and my friends.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.080 align:middle line:90%
And my dog will eat that.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't buy dog food.

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:41.518 align:middle line:90%
I make all my dog food.

00:51:41.518 --> 00:51:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And somebody will tell
me, well, that's unethical

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.090 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing.

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:45.007 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, really?

00:51:45.007 --> 00:51:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Because if we actually looked at
the impacts of what I'm doing,

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.230 align:middle line:84%
what one animal can
do in my household

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:55.340 align:middle line:84%
versus the average person who
eats meat maybe and eats--

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:57.950 align:middle line:84%
let's say they buy a cut of
meat, and it's from one animal.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.375 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, they
buy another cut of meat.

00:51:59.375 --> 00:52:00.417 align:middle line:90%
It's from another animal.

00:52:00.417 --> 00:52:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And they might eat actually
150 individuals, but only

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.500 align:middle line:90%
one part of each one of them.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Whereas I'll eat the same
number of meals of meat,

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:12.650 align:middle line:84%
but from one, or two,
or three animals.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.313 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to
see the judgments

00:52:14.313 --> 00:52:15.980 align:middle line:84%
from people who don't
have relationships

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.050 align:middle line:90%
to the natural world.

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's like I was saying
before with the data points.

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Each species that I know is
like another data point for me.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.710 align:middle line:84%
It's something I can rely on,
someone I can reach out to

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:28.650 align:middle line:90%
in a time of need.

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:30.108 align:middle line:84%
So when I look out
at the landscape

00:52:30.108 --> 00:52:34.337 align:middle line:84%
and I see all these
individuals, I feel--

00:52:34.337 --> 00:52:36.420 align:middle line:84%
we talk about this thing
like the human condition.

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.150 align:middle line:84%
That's relaxed in
me because I know

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I am not an astronaut on a
foreign planet who's just

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:47.190 align:middle line:84%
got this last bit of
air supply that I need

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:48.570 align:middle line:90%
or I'm going to die.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that deep
inside people is a fear

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:55.260 align:middle line:84%
that if the underpinnings
of their culture gave way,

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.015 align:middle line:90%
they do not know how to be here.

00:52:57.015 --> 00:52:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I would feel that fear
if I was an astronaut.

00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:02.700 align:middle line:84%
If I was on the Moon or
Mars, I would feel like, wow,

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:05.670 align:middle line:84%
if I didn't have all this
equipment or some of it fails,

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:07.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm a dead man.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:11.170 align:middle line:84%
I need this to tether
me back to life.

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think people feel like
that about their supermarkets,

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and their equipment,
all that stuff

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.710 align:middle line:84%
because they know they
don't know anything

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:19.710 align:middle line:84%
about the natural world
or how to survive there.

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:21.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why they consume so
many of those fake survival

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:25.860 align:middle line:84%
shows, to see people who do,
and try to pick up tips, and OK.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And then they will spout
back these little fake facts

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.210 align:middle line:84%
that they saw on
these survival shows.

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.180 align:middle line:84%
It empowers them a little bit to
think they maybe got something

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.620 align:middle line:90%
out of it.

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually
do this stuff,

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.490 align:middle line:84%
you develop these
meaningful relationships.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:39.840 align:middle line:90%
That eases inside you.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And you just know, I am
part of this natural world.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.497 align:middle line:90%
I know how to live here.

00:53:45.497 --> 00:53:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because I
think that something bad is

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.300 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to our society.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.500 align:middle line:84%
It's because that's
in all of us.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:57.480 align:middle line:84%
We rely on the supply
that's handed down

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.800 align:middle line:84%
through that hierarchy
we've been talking about.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.425 align:middle line:84%
And the fear that you could
be cut off lives in us.

00:54:02.425 --> 00:54:03.225 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:54:03.225 --> 00:54:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So I feel very
comfortable and relaxed.

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think for people, if
they can go on a plant walk,

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:10.890 align:middle line:84%
if they can learn to
make just a cup of tea

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.812 align:middle line:84%
from something that grows around
them, that's how you start.

00:54:13.812 --> 00:54:15.270 align:middle line:84%
You don't start by
going, I'm going

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:18.720 align:middle line:84%
to go out and do a moose
hunt or something like that.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, I'm going to buy a boat
and go lobstering or something

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:22.130 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, I'm going to
take some dandelion leaves

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and make some tea that's going
to be good for my kidneys,

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be
good for my liver.

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.950 align:middle line:84%
More than that, it's going
to be good for my soul

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.260 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to know
that I have just created

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.880 align:middle line:90%
a relationship with a species.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And now every time
I see a dandelion,

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:42.690 align:middle line:84%
it's more than just a yellow
blot on the landscape.

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:46.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a friend of mine, and
I work with that friend.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And over time, when you
develop more and more of those,

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.950 align:middle line:84%
eventually you've got
hundreds of creatures

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:57.930 align:middle line:84%
that make up your actual body,
that make up your actual body.

00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:59.220 align:middle line:90%
You are made of them.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.543 align:middle line:84%
And then when people
criticize that it's like--

00:55:01.543 --> 00:55:04.200 align:middle line:84%
[SNORTS] --OK, man,
what are you made of?

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Stuff from everywhere you
have no relationship to,

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.820 align:middle line:90%
you don't even know what it is.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.300 align:middle line:84%
The average person,
for instance,

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.440 align:middle line:84%
does not know even what
the foods that they eat

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.390 align:middle line:84%
look like when they're
grown out half the time.

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:18.673 align:middle line:84%
For instance, everybody
knows what asparagus

00:55:18.673 --> 00:55:20.340 align:middle line:84%
looks like when you
buy it in the store,

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.650 align:middle line:84%
but most people wouldn't
recognize an adult asparagus

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:23.790 align:middle line:90%
plant.

00:55:23.790 --> 00:55:25.457 align:middle line:84%
You could put them
right in front of it.

00:55:25.457 --> 00:55:26.290 align:middle line:90%
They would not know.

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:28.082 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
what a lettuce looks

00:55:28.082 --> 00:55:29.370 align:middle line:90%
like unless they've grown it.

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:31.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what it looks
like when it's gone to flower.

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:33.670 align:middle line:84%
They've eaten it
their whole life.

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:36.045 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really interesting
when you start, let's say,

00:55:36.045 --> 00:55:38.250 align:middle line:90%
fishing, and you harvest a--

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:42.390 align:middle line:84%
I was cod fishing a
few days ago in Canada.

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:43.390 align:middle line:90%
You bring up a cod fish.

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is a fish that
you've grown up eating--

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.890 align:middle line:90%
fish and chips.

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:50.375 align:middle line:84%
Cod is a ubiquitous fish
people eat around the world,

00:55:50.375 --> 00:55:51.750 align:middle line:84%
but most people
couldn't tell you

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:55.030 align:middle line:84%
what a cod fish looks like, even
though they've had it forever.

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Most people have eaten it.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.008 align:middle line:84%
The McFish sandwich--
it's pollock.

00:55:59.008 --> 00:56:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know
what a pollock looks like.

00:56:01.050 --> 00:56:02.508 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting too when

00:56:02.508 --> 00:56:04.710 align:middle line:84%
you start to get back to
who these species are,

00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:06.090 align:middle line:90%
not just what they look like--

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:10.230 align:middle line:84%
who they are, where they
live, how they behave.

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And you become part of that.

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:14.310 align:middle line:84%
At this point in
my life, I couldn't

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:16.670 align:middle line:90%
imagine giving that up.

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's profound.

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:20.285 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:20.285 --> 00:56:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you've given
a lot here, Daniel.

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that through
your explanation,

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.100 align:middle line:84%
you're leading by
example in terms

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.200 align:middle line:84%
of how people can rewild
themselves and experience

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.860 align:middle line:84%
more peace to ease the
condition of being human.

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And I see it in Vanuatu as well
with the Indigenous people.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:39.440 align:middle line:84%
They're happy and connected
because every day they're

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.480 align:middle line:90%
in communion with nature.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've taken that away
from most of our lives.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there's anything
you want to finalize on

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.795 align:middle line:84%
or any thoughts
you want to leave--

00:56:49.795 --> 00:56:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I know you're
going to edit it,

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.315 align:middle line:84%
so I just want to say
this to you about that,

00:56:52.315 --> 00:56:55.225 align:middle line:84%
is that the big
difference is that, again,

00:56:55.225 --> 00:56:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm approaching
it as a practice,

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming out
of a lineage of it.

00:56:58.410 --> 00:57:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'll never be able to
gather that much information,

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.790 align:middle line:84%
as much as that they hold
about their landscape.

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But also, I'm an
orphan, and they're not.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know where my
lineage even comes from because

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.700 align:middle line:90%
there was a break in it.

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And most of us are orphans.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.440 align:middle line:90%
So we don't know our people.

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.623 align:middle line:84%
We don't say-- you don't
come here and-- oh,

00:57:21.623 --> 00:57:23.290 align:middle line:84%
you tell me about
your mom and your dad,

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:24.080 align:middle line:90%
and then all the way--

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.038 align:middle line:84%
yeah, and we trace our
lineage all the way back

00:57:26.038 --> 00:57:27.240 align:middle line:90%
to the first people.

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Because most
hunter-gatherers believe

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.470 align:middle line:84%
that they can
trace their lineage

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.630 align:middle line:90%
back to the first humans.

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:36.540 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those
ubiquitous things,

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:38.590 align:middle line:84%
like, well, we're
the real people.

00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:41.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of tribes' name
translates to the real people,

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:45.330 align:middle line:84%
the real ones, or the
right people, or whatever.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:50.040 align:middle line:84%
We, most of us, can go like, oh,
well, I'm from sort of England.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.158 align:middle line:84%
Most of us can only
go back so far.

00:57:52.158 --> 00:57:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
break somewhere where

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.980 align:middle line:90%
our people were separated.

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.500 align:middle line:84%
That's a big part of the
domestication process.

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Your dog does not know
it was a gray wolf.

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:03.150 align:middle line:84%
We can't trace back
to Indigenous people,

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:07.320 align:middle line:84%
so all I can do is
piece together the best

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.650 align:middle line:90%
mosaic that I can right now.

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Those last Indigenous
people are really important.

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're really,
really important.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Because if we lost
every dog on the planet,

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:19.770 align:middle line:84%
we can just get gray wolves
and turn them into dogs again.

00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:22.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to lose the
last Indigenous people.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.693 align:middle line:84%
All that's left are going to
be domesticated orphan people.

00:58:24.693 --> 00:58:26.110 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
scary thing to me.

00:58:26.110 --> 00:58:27.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's like--

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:28.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:32.980 align:middle line:84%
At this point, we actually
are starting over in a way.

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And this practice that I'm
doing is like a starting over.

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I hope I can share
it with more people

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:41.170 align:middle line:84%
because we absolutely
need this going forward.

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:44.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we can't--

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.940 align:middle line:90%
this can only go on so long.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Like if something's
not sustainable, well,

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:48.970 align:middle line:90%
then that's it.

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Why even keep doing it?

00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we know it
can't be sustained.

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.315 align:middle line:84%
We have to do
something different.

00:58:54.315 --> 00:58:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And even if this
is only a piece,

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:57.640 align:middle line:84%
this is the piece
that I'm taking up.

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share it because
this has to be kept alive.

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:04.390 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to have
baseball hall of fame museums

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.755 align:middle line:84%
and not have any museums
dedicated to this,

00:59:06.755 --> 00:59:07.630 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.030 align:middle line:84%
This should be kept alive,
even if it's a museum thing.

00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:13.000 align:middle line:84%
If there's going to be
renaissance fairs and civil war

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.250 align:middle line:84%
reenactments, and
nobody's reenacting

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:17.720 align:middle line:84%
the life of living on the
landscape, that makes no sense.

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:18.520 align:middle line:90%
That's our way.

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.855 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'm doing.

00:59:19.855 --> 00:59:21.730 align:middle line:84%
I know it pales to what
you're talking about,

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:22.605 align:middle line:90%
the people out there.

00:59:22.605 --> 00:59:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll never have that.

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But what I have
is enough for me.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.840 align:middle line:90%
It's really satisfying.

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> So cool.

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for your time, Daniel.

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:29.980 align:middle line:84%
It's great to
chat, as per usual.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And let's try and not be so
long between conversations

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.500 align:middle line:90%
next time.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.333 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:59:34.333 --> 00:59:37.470 align:middle line:10%
