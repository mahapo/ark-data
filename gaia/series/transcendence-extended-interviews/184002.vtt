[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here, and
today we have an extra special

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.800 align:middle line:90%
guest.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Koya Webb.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And she has gone from
an upbringing to a life

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.380 align:middle line:84%
that she would probably never
have imagined in her childhood.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:84%
She is now a plant-based and
yogic warrior goddess, showing

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:84%
people the tools,
tricks, and tips

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.530 align:middle line:84%
it takes to transform
your life and keep

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:90%
that momentum and high energy.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Her story is unbelievable,
and I can't wait

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.575 align:middle line:90%
to share it with you today.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:35.375 align:middle line:90%
Koya, hello.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me where
are you're from,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and what was it like growing
up in the Koya Webb household?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm from Humboldt, Tennessee.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And growing up, we
didn't have much.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I grew up on powdered
milk and the Helping Hand.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Grew up in a trailer.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
My mom and dad, four
kids, so six people total.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And it was not a double wide.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
smallest trailers.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I remember as kids just climbing
the walls, and trying to calm--

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:90%
and we were rambunctious.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.030 align:middle line:84%
We were just really
tearing things up,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and my mom had to
kick us outside.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Once the sun came up,
we were kicked outside,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
because we would wreck
the house otherwise.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.348 align:middle line:84%
And I just grew
up in the country,

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.390 align:middle line:90%
so that was a good thing.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:84%
But I was also
separated from the city.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt like
a little bit left out,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
a little bit different,
because we didn't have much.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And the kids would
make fun of me,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and my clothes, and being
skinny, and just everything.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It was very much bullied
a lot at a young age.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what to
do, so I turned to sports.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I tried to
try out for cheerleading.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.898 align:middle line:90%
Didn't make the team.

00:01:51.898 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I got so nervous, I was,
like, [HYPERVENTILATING]

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.003 align:middle line:84%
hyperventilating,
because really, I wasn't

00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
used to being around people.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.717 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't used to performing.

00:01:58.717 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
All I knew was I wanted
to get out of the country.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be a
part of the in-crowd.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to be
like the country girl

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
with the Helping Hand clothes,
and hair was always messed up.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.985 align:middle line:90%
And didn't make that.

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I tried out for basketball.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I was so clumsy.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I had a growth spurt,
and I was just clumsy.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't keep the ball.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:90%
I remember trying to dribble.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't dribble.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:90%
Didn't make the basketball team.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So going to high school, I
had no athletic experience,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.270 align:middle line:90%
no nothing.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And I made a
commitment to myself.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I will practice
as much as I need to,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:90%
but I want to be a part.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be left out.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember thinking
that, like, what can I do?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Who do I have to be?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
Because as I was, I
didn't feel accepted.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't feel loved.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:90%
And so I started to run.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I know.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.447 align:middle line:84%
I can get on the track team,
because I would run and catch

00:02:58.447 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
the bus, and I'd always get
close to beating my brothers,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:90%
and I was really fast.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.835 align:middle line:84%
So didn't make the
cheerleading team.

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Didn't make the basketball.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.377 align:middle line:84%
So I went out for
track and field,

00:03:06.377 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and I made the track
and field team.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.935 align:middle line:84%
Because who doesn't make
the track and field?

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] As long as you
can run around the track,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:90%
you can get on it.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I felt
good about it.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I'm on a team.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.732 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of society.

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
people understand

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
how much if you
live in the country

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and you're not a
city kid growing up,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:90%
you are really left out.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of people
who've grown up being bullied,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
you know how detrimental
it can be as a child

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:84%
growing up different, or
growing up as outcasts.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So I had the
experience growing up.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And my mom and dad did
the best they could,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
but when I was younger,
I really wasn't

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
a part about any kind of
music, any kind of sport,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:90%
any part of anything.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So feeling that way, it made me
become a loner unintentionally.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started getting
on a track and field team,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and getting these accolades,
and getting faster and faster,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:90%
I found my sense of purpose.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh, I'm important
because I can run fast.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And people are nice
to me, are kind to me.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.120 align:middle line:90%
My mom and dad cheer for me.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that was my first
feeling of being accepted,

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
is when I started to run
track and field and do well.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, after that
year, I was like,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
now maybe I can try the
basketball team again.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I went out, and I
didn't make it again.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And my coach at the time,
he was like, oh, man,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.345 align:middle line:84%
if they only knew how much
of an athlete you were.

00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And my first year of
running track and field,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I made it to the state meet.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:90%
I ran on the four-by-one relay.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was just a
hard worker for sure.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And my coach was
like, you know what?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Let me go talk to
the basketball coach,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and I'll see if I can
get you on the team.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I was listening to
my coach, my track coach,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.950 align:middle line:90%
talk to the basketball coach.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
you know, just--

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:90%
she'll be great.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Even if she has
to ride the bench,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:84%
she can play good
defense, and she

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:90%
can run up and down the court.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Just give her a chance.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And so reluctantly, the
basketball coach is like,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
all right, you
know, hey, you know.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They had a losing season anyway,
so what could they lose, right?

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think my coach
reminded him of that.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
He's like, yeah,
you know, the team

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.015 align:middle line:84%
could probably do
a little better

00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle line:90%
with a little bit of energy.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And she's a good kid.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:90%
She's a good kid.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I remember him saying that, and
I was like, oh, that's nice.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, my parents

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.800 align:middle line:84%
weren't really that
affectionate, so

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I never really--

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:84%
until I became an adult and
put that into our lifestyle,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
it really wasn't a lot
of hugs, and good jobs.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:90%
And my mom taught us a lot--

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
we learned a lot, but I think
because my dad was working

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:90%
a lot, it was just not--

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:90%
just the way we grew up.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.178 align:middle line:84%
And so when I would
hear little things,

00:05:47.178 --> 00:05:48.470 align:middle line:90%
they would mean the most to me.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And plus, I was also
a very sensitive kid.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Which I didn't find
out until later,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.460 align:middle line:84%
but I realized that a lot of
the things that I experienced

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
were because of
my sensitivities.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that me
wanting to be accepted

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.058 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to be
loved-- of course I was,

00:06:03.058 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't feel it,
because I didn't feel

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:90%
like I was part of the team.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I got on
the basketball team.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:90%
I was so excited.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So here I am, track
and field, basketball.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And the entire first
year, I rode the bench.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember we
had a losing season.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
We didn't win one game.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So here I was,
athletic, energetic,

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
excited to be on the
team, but couldn't even

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:90%
play on a losing team.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember we had two
games left in the season.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.665 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, if she could
just let me play one time,

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I could show her what I have,
I could show her my skills,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.915 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So finally, after
being nervous--

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd been practicing
in my basement,

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.353 align:middle line:84%
dribbling around a pole,
getting my right-hand skills--

00:06:44.353 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:84%
I could only dribble with
my right hand, by the way,

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.900 align:middle line:84%
but I could dribble really
well with my right hand.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:90%
And I played great defense.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Lots of rebounds.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I was great in
practice, but I just

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.310 align:middle line:84%
never got to play because
I was kind of like the girl

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:90%
the coach let on the team.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.123 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I
build up my courage.

00:07:00.123 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I'm going to
ask coach, can she let me in?

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we were losing, and it
was about four minutes left,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:90%
and I was like, can I just play?

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:90%
Can I just touch the ball?

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And she was just like,
looking at me like, no.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I was just like,
please, just four minutes.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:90%
I would really appreciate it.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:90%
She's like, all right, Koya.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:90%
And so I just was like--

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:90%
I was so excited.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:90%
So I got in the game.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm going to-- and
I had dreamed of this moment

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.273 align:middle line:90%
so many times.

00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm going to
grab that ball off the rim.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.565 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to dribble to
the other end of the court.

00:07:32.565 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to just
lay it up-- of course

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I want to dunk it,
but I couldn't dunk.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.022 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I'm going
to lay it up really nice

00:07:38.022 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
like I've done in
practice so many times.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So once I got in
there, I knew it.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:90%
I was going to rebound.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I was going to box
out and get that ball.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.370 align:middle line:90%
So I did it.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:90%
I got in the game.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I rebound the ball, and I
got it, and I protected it.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I dribbled all the
way down the court,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:90%
and I shot it in the goal.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was waiting to
hear these yelling,

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:90%
and everyone was like, oh!

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, what happened?

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:90%
I shot at the wrong goal.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
wait a minute, this

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.310 align:middle line:84%
is not the way this
was supposed to go!

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:84%
It was so terrible,
and I was like, no!

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And the coach is like,
Koya, get over here!

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, God.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:90%
I was mortified.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.775 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like,
man, God, I'm never

00:08:18.775 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:90%
going to get to play again.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:90%
I might as well just quit.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Felt bad.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So I got pulled out of the game,
and that was my glory moment,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, for sure never
going to get to play again.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:90%
And then that game got over.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:90%
The last game.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had messed up,
but I had to redeem myself.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:84%
So again, I did
great in practice.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:90%
I made points.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I did well.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I was actually a better
player than the person

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that I was going in
for, and I knew that,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't getting
the opportunity

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to shine when the
pressure was on.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.527 align:middle line:84%
So that's why, when
the pressure was on,

00:08:49.527 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I totally shot at
the wrong goal.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I was so excited.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, I'm
not going to do that.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I was like, that goal's
mine, that goal's theirs.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And I kept up the
whole game, made

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:90%
sure I knew which goal was ours.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And then so finally,
at the end, I

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
was just like-- there's
four more minutes.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I was waiting under the clock.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I'm
going to ask again.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.862 align:middle line:84%
She's got to have some
compassion, right?

00:09:08.862 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, I'm so sorry
about what happened last time.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Just give me one more chance.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I promise I know this goal's
ours, that goal's theirs.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.470 align:middle line:90%
I got it.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:90%
We're losing again-- of course.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.080 align:middle line:90%
We're always losing.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
We're going to lose, so just
let me just touch the ball.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.830 align:middle line:90%
That'd be great.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:90%
She's like, go ahead.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.291 align:middle line:90%
I was like, yes!

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:90%
I get in.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:90%
We're losing.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm just excited
about getting a chance

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:90%
to play with my teammates.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:90%
I made a good pass.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:90%
I made an assist.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And my teammates shot, and
I was like, OK, perfect.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:90%
All right, so I got this down.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.042 align:middle line:90%
Rebound the ball.

00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You know what you're
going to do with it.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
So long story short,
I scored a point.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was like-- that
was like the best moment.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.695 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- because the girl
that played my entire position

00:09:53.695 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
in front of me, she
would play the whole game

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.987 align:middle line:84%
and she wouldn't score, so I
was like, if I could at least

00:09:57.987 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:90%
score, I'll be excited.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.820 align:middle line:90%
So I scored a point.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:90%
And that was like, ah!

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I was Michael
Jordan or someone.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.550 align:middle line:90%
So I was happy about it.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And the season was over.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
The game was over.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:90%
I scored a point.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.045 align:middle line:84%
And so the next
year, I was like,

00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:13.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to practice
as hard as I can,

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to do well.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to start.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.403 align:middle line:84%
That was my goal going
into my junior year.

00:10:18.403 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't play
my freshman year.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Got on the team, rode the
bench my sophomore year.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So my junior year, I was
like, I'm going to play.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So long story short,
our coach got fired

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and a new coach got let
in, and after summer,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
me being such a great athlete,
and playing, and being a team

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:90%
player, I got to start.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
I started my junior
year after riding

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:90%
bench my entire sophomore year.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.663 align:middle line:84%
And after the entire
year, I got most improved.

00:10:44.663 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like, oh my
goodness, I can't believe this.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:90%
This is a dream come true.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the girl that I came
in for wasn't happy about it,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
but still, I was
just so excited.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And they graduated.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I
know now I'm going

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
to get a good chance to
play the entire season.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:84%
So my senior year,
I was like, I'm

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:84%
going to do everything I can to
make us have a winning season.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And we had a winning
season my senior year.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.280 align:middle line:84%
I end up getting most
rebounds, most points,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:90%
and MVP my senior year.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.460 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, yeah!

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so much
like, you know

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:90%
what, that's what it takes.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:84%
If you don't give
up, and something--

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
one quote that I always remember
was that you cannot fail unless

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:90%
you stop trying.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And I knew then that if
I just kept working hard,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:84%
kept being a team player,
and just did everything

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.990 align:middle line:84%
that I could to learn the
game, learn my opponent,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to work together
with my team, we would do well.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like not
just trying to be--

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go out
trying to be the MVP.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I went out trying to
just start on the team,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and try to be a
team player, and it

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:90%
resulted in all those things.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I was so grateful.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I was so happy.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And that made me
realize how important it

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:84%
is, not only to
be a team player,

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:90%
but also to never ever give up.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And that quote is still
one of my favorites.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:84%
You never fail unless
you stop trying.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
What was it like, the
food and the nourishment

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.457 align:middle line:84%
in the Koya Webb household
growing up as a kid?

00:12:16.457 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:90%
You explained that to me before.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.707 align:middle line:84%
It was a lot different
than how you eat today.

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:22.736 align:middle line:84%
What was it like sitting around
to dinner with your family?

00:12:22.736 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for me, when I was a
young girl living in a trailer

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
before I was seven, I
remember powdered milk.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I remember just not having
many options for food.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So when, eventually, my dad
got a better job, and my mom--

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:90%
who's a stay-at-home mom--

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:84%
we were able to have
home-cooked meals.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So having a piece of meat,
bread, vegetables was great.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Having snack cakes when we
couldn't afford it before

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:90%
was amazing.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So having Twinkies,
and oatmeal pies.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we discovered
Hamburger Helper, and Tuna

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Helper, and all these things.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And being able to
cook for my family

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:90%
was really important for me.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.125 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea of all the
toxins, and chemicals,

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
and things that
were in the food.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:90%
All I knew is that food is love.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I feed people, they
smile, and they're happy,

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:90%
and it means love.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.673 align:middle line:84%
And so not knowing these
things growing up--

00:13:21.673 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and when I found out
about these things,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh my
goodness, do you

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.900 align:middle line:84%
know that our favorite
Jiffy cornbread has

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle line:84%
high fructose corn
syrup in it, or MSG?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
first time I found out

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
about all these chemicals
and preservatives,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I ran
to the grocery store

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to see how many of the things
that I love contained it.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Every single thing that
I loved that was in a box

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
contained either high
fructose corn syrup, MSG,

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.290 align:middle line:84%
or some artificial
flavoring or coloring.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, growing
up in what I felt like

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
was pretty much a lot
of home-cooked meals.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
My mom really-- and I think
that's why I was healthier.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sick growing up.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.002 align:middle line:84%
But I did have a lot
of mucus in my system,

00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and then once a
year, I'd break out

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:90%
in a nasty rash over my face.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I would have chronic
yeast infection

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
as I got more mature
as a girl, and that

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.810 align:middle line:84%
was because of drinking out of
plastic, all the chemicals, all

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:84%
the preservatives
and things like that.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.782 align:middle line:90%
All the processed food.

00:14:19.782 --> 00:14:21.990 align:middle line:84%
We thought, hey, if it's
seasoned and it tastes good,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.370 align:middle line:90%
it's great.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.245 align:middle line:84%
So even though we would
have the home-cooked,

00:14:24.245 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:84%
we'd also have a lot of
preserved foods, TV dinners,

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and things like that as
well, so that that balance

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:90%
wasn't really healthy.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So I thank God at least half
of our meals were home-cooked,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
but the other half was
actually very, very processed.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And we felt like, oh,
we can afford this now.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.192 align:middle line:84%
We can afford these
things, thinking

00:14:42.192 --> 00:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
it was a good thing,
when actually,

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.300 align:middle line:90%
it was actually a detriment.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:84%
What was good was actually
the home-cooked meals

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:84%
that my mom used to
make when we first got

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.010 align:middle line:84%
started and were able to
afford to have real food.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.650 align:middle line:84%
So it was really hard
growing up knowing

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
that when I finally got
what I thought was good,

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:84%
we started to introduce too
much of the processed stuff.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And now that I know better, now
that I know all the chemicals

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and preservatives in food, I'm
now focused on eating clean.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Eating more fruits
and vegetables.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.192 align:middle line:84%
Really focusing on food that is
as close to nature as possible.

00:15:18.192 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
really important.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You said before when
we spoke about how, often,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.140 align:middle line:84%
you'd have a lot of
canned vegetables,

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and there wasn't a lot of
fresh vegetables available

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:90%
in your area.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Could you speak to that?

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.573 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that when
we think about food,

00:15:31.573 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
we don't really stop
to think that there

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.455 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of places where it's
difficult to get vegetables.

00:15:35.455 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
food deserts out there.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our main grocery
store was Piggly Wiggly,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
so it was definitely fruits
and vegetables available.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.693 align:middle line:84%
But then, because we live
so far out in the country,

00:15:48.693 --> 00:15:50.610 align:middle line:84%
it was just like, of
course we will get canned

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:90%
because they will last longer.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:90%
So we had a lot of canned food.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And we would get maybe
some Romaine lettuce,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
but we had a lot of canned food,
like hot dogs, smoked sausages.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I remember all our greens, corn,
Pinto beans, things like that

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:05.970 align:middle line:90%
were canned.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:90%
But we'd have some fresh too.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
We'd have some fresh
beans, and we'd

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
have some things like celery
and cabbage, but not a lot.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Thinking like maybe one
fresh thing per meal,

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't even fresh.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:90%
It was cooked then.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But it was doing well
for what we thought.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:84%
At least one green vegetable,
a meal was really great.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So you continued to advance
your athletic career through

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.320 align:middle line:84%
college, separate
to the basketball.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
the impetus for you

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
coming out to California
to try out for the Olympics

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and you started
getting plagued by injury.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit about
that part of your life.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I went
through college,

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
my first year I
gained 25 pounds.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:90%
And they say that freshman 15--

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I gained 25 because I
was like, oh my goodness,

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:84%
all this free food, being an
athlete, and I ate it all,

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.547 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't understand
why I wasn't doing good.

00:17:04.547 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, my coach explained
to me the laws of gravity

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.297 align:middle line:84%
and how, when you
gain that much weight,

00:17:08.297 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
it's harder to get
over a high jump bar.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned
to balance my diet,

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:90%
and I would train really hard.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to the new
school, Wichita State,

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:90%
I was committed to working hard.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was,
sometimes we don't realize,

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
but I was training so hard, I
wasn't getting enough sleep.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I graduated with a 3.8,
but all those studies

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.530 align:middle line:84%
left me not getting
enough sleep,

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:84%
not getting enough
recovery time.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We were supposed to get in the
cold whirlpool, rehab our body,

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
go swimming, things
to counterbalance

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
all the things we were
doing on the track,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and I would skip
those things to study.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So I really wasn't
taking care of myself.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't practicing that
self-care that I really

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:90%
needed to be a healthy athlete.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, my junior
year-- my sophomore year,

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I got a stress fracture
in my lower back.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
devastating thing

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that had happened
to me, because I

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.598 align:middle line:84%
was slated to win the
conference the next year,

00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, my
coach is like, I'm sorry.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:90%
You're out for the season.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm just like--

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:90%
it was just like, in shock.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe it,
and I got really sad.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I was crying in
classes, and my teacher

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.418 align:middle line:90%
sent me to the counselor.

00:18:15.418 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And the counselor
was like, you know,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:90%
I think you should try yoga.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I didn't
know what yoga was.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I just thought yoga
was voodoo, and it

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:84%
was separate from Christianity,
and that I couldn't do it.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.067 align:middle line:84%
But she's like no,
it's just stretching.

00:18:31.067 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, well,
I don't have a choice.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.983 align:middle line:90%
I got kicked out of class.

00:18:33.983 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
I gotta go do this
yoga stretching thing.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I went to class.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:84%
I remember trying
to do a headstand,

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like my brain
was going to ooze out

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:90%
the top of my skull.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, I am
not made for this.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:90%
This is painful.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.035 align:middle line:90%
And this is not me.

00:18:47.035 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my teacher
seeing me struggle.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:84%
She came over to me,
and she looked at me.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
She's like, I just
want you to breathe.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I took a big inhale with
her, and we exhaled together,

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and for that moment,
I felt spirit.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
I felt this feeling, this
tingling over my whole body,

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and I hadn't felt it
since I was 12 years old.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking,
oh, this is the Holy Spirit.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm supposed
to give baptized now.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's when I got baptized.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And going through college, for
me, I lost that connection.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:84%
I was still a good
person, and I still

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.120 align:middle line:84%
did good by people
and things like that,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't have
that daily connection

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
like I have now, which
was established when I got

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.633 align:middle line:90%
injured in college.

00:19:25.633 --> 00:19:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I made that
connection, and eventually,

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:84%
after a year of swimming,
and biking, and meditation,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:84%
and yoga, I came back to win
the conference meet in college,

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and I led Wichita State to its
first women's championship.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So it came back to
like, in basketball,

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:90%
I had that kind of comeback.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
happened in track,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.380 align:middle line:90%
and it was because of yoga.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.625 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, I
was like, yay, win!

00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So I moved to
California to train

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
in San Diego, which is close
to the Olympic Training Center,

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:90%
because I was so close.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I'm so close.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I've only had one year.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
If I could do all
of that in one year,

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.270 align:middle line:84%
what can I do if I had a
really great coach and really

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:90%
great training?

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So I contacted Rahn Sheffield,
the San Diego State,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.670 align:middle line:90%
and I begged him.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:10.780 align:middle line:90%
He was like, who are you?

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.055 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I'm Koya.

00:20:12.055 --> 00:20:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, I've
never heard of you.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I know,
but I promise you

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
I'll get better every single
day I step on the track.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.282 align:middle line:84%
And he was like,
well, I'm just going

00:20:19.282 --> 00:20:22.440 align:middle line:84%
to accept it, because you
really have a lot of courage

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:90%
to just reach out to me.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.357 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, great.

00:20:24.357 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:90%
So I flew myself to California.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.370 align:middle line:90%
I knew no one here.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:90%
No family or anything.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I was just determined
to follow my dreams.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.763 align:middle line:90%
And I came out here, and I did.

00:20:32.763 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Every time I stepped
on the track,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.638 align:middle line:84%
I got better and
better and better.

00:20:35.638 --> 00:20:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But again, I wasn't
taking care of myself.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I became a personal
trainer at 24 Hour Fitness.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I was working from
5:00 AM to 10:00.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I would run track
from 11:00 to about 3:00,

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and then I would go back and
work from 5:00 to 10:00 again.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a full list of clients,
getting great results

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.777 align:middle line:84%
with them, but I was
getting very little

00:20:54.777 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:84%
sleep, and of course,
very little recovery.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.120 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Injured again.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:90%
This time I pulled my hamstring.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.180 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, ugh.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And then going through
also frustrations

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:84%
of a big breakup
that happened when

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I moved from Kansas
to California

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.340 align:middle line:84%
was really hard
emotionally on me as well.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.510 align:middle line:84%
So all those things unprocessed
takes a toll on your body.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.580 align:middle line:90%
So here I am, injured again.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:90%
And so where do I turn?

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Yoga, meditation.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:90%
This time, it healed me again.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And this time, I was
like, you know what?

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:90%
There's something to this.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, you know what,
I can't let this go again.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.922 align:middle line:84%
I need to commit to
this as a lifestyle

00:21:33.922 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and not just come
in and out of it.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.315 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to sign up for my
first yoga teacher training.

00:21:38.315 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And not just any yoga
teacher training.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I signed up for ashtanga, which
is the hardest form of yoga

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:90%
you can possibly do.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And in that 30 days, I
completely changed my life.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:90%
I had visions.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:90%
I felt so connected.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.550 align:middle line:90%
I saw my purpose.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
I saw me making a difference
in people's lives.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know I would be
doing what I'm doing today.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I was going to
be doing something great just

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.800 align:middle line:90%
using my life and my voice.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I made a
commitment to do yoga daily.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I ended up
finding this agency called

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Sports and Lifestyle Unlimited.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I want
to get into this agency,

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.217 align:middle line:90%
but I haven't done any work.

00:22:21.217 --> 00:22:23.675 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I want to start
modeling because I was injured,

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't run anymore.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.820 align:middle line:90%
So there was this--

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Nike had a ad, and they
were doing this audition.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, I would
love to be a Nike athlete.

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I would love to run.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.118 align:middle line:84%
And so I went out for
it, and they were like,

00:22:36.118 --> 00:22:38.660 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, you're great, you're
perfect, you're a perfect fit.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.448 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you know,
I went out before,

00:22:40.448 --> 00:22:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and I heard that before,
and I didn't get picked,

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:90%
so I wonder why.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, I don't know,
let me see your audition sheet.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.480 align:middle line:90%
They looked.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:90%
They're like, oh, that's why.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:90%
I was like, why?

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.070 align:middle line:84%
They're like, because
you have a size 10 foot.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm 5' 11".

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm supposed to
have a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
They're like, no, but our
sample size is size seven.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I was like, hmm, let
me see that shoe.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed the shoe,
pulled the insole out,

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and stuffed my size 10
foot into a size 7 shoe.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, you
know what, I can fit in.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I can-- they're like,
all right, you're hired.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And I worked so many jobs.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I worked for Reebok, for
Nike, for Asics, [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Roadrunner, job after job.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's how I moved to LA.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So long story short,
I actually end up

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:84%
injuring myself
wearing tight shoes,

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and I got a big
lump behind my knee

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:90%
from running in a tight shoe.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And my career had grown
so much that companies

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:84%
start buying the
shoe to fit my foot

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and not so much worrying
about the sample size.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how I started
my career of fitness modeling.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:90%
And so that went very well.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:90%
I moved to LA.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And as a yoga
instructor, I realized

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:84%
that it was more than just
being fit in your body.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
It was also in your mind.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
So I signed up for my first
life coaching certification,

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:90%
and I became a life coach.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I started to
embody mental, spiritual,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:90%
and physical fitness.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I do today is I'm
a holistic health coach,

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.353 align:middle line:84%
embodying, taking those things
I learned from yoga, meditation,

00:24:04.353 --> 00:24:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and really meeting
people where they are

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.585 align:middle line:84%
and helping them live
a healthy lifestyle.

00:24:08.585 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Tell me a little bit
about your yoga journey.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So after that first
ashtanga teacher training--

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and I've done ashtanga, and
it's like, this isn't yoga,

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:90%
this is torture.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.085 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] It is.

00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:21.290 align:middle line:90%
>> But I liked it.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:84%
I practiced it a lot at a
point in time in my life.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
challenging form of yoga.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
After that teacher
training, tell me

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.820 align:middle line:90%
about your yoga trajectory.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Did you keep studying
more yoga, more people?

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.525 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think you've done
200 hours of teacher training

00:24:33.525 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>> 500.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> 500, OK.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Tell me about how that
kept stacking for you,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.710 align:middle line:90%
how more yoga led to more yoga.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And not so much from the
modeling perspective,

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.650 align:middle line:84%
but what that started to
open up in your life in terms

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:84%
of helping people uncover their
purpose, and live their dreams,

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and how your commitment
to that focus and yoga--

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.020 align:middle line:84%
which is union, and
oneness, and love--

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:84%
helped you help inspire
more people to do the same.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that one month of
intense yoga really helped me

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.460 align:middle line:84%
realize how important
self-care is.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:90%
And how important it is--

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.627 align:middle line:84%
I'd always try to
take care of others.

00:25:13.627 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:90%
I was a team player.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And what made me a good team
player is that I was always

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.587 align:middle line:84%
looking out for other people,
like, how are they feeling?

00:25:19.587 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Are they getting it?

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Because once I
learned, I was always

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:84%
into teaching and sharing
it with other people.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.848 align:middle line:84%
And so I was always
really mindful.

00:25:26.848 --> 00:25:27.890 align:middle line:90%
I was like a little mama.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
They call me little
mama all the time

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.270 align:middle line:84%
because I was making sure
people were getting their rest.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And so after that, I
started to post online

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:84%
on this platform called
Instagram, because I was like,

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.285 align:middle line:90%
OK, I know--

00:25:41.285 --> 00:25:44.090 align:middle line:84%
they had this challenge
called Grow So Beautiful,

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:45.823 align:middle line:84%
and you post your
practice every day.

00:25:45.823 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
you know what, I'm

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
going to post my practice every
day so I, one, stay committed,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and I inspire other people
to practice more yoga.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:90%
And so I was practicing.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I was posting once a day.

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And I start growing a following.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And people were like
doing the hashtag,

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:90%
and they were posting with me.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
I start holding
classes at the beach,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and people start coming
out to my classes.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow,
this is really amazing.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And I start, again,
getting my own sleep.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.353 align:middle line:90%
I started eating better.

00:26:14.353 --> 00:26:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Through that
transition, I started

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:84%
eating more fruits and
vegetables, more plants,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
really adopting a
plant-based lifestyle.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Meditation and yoga.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:84%
All that together was
making me a stronger person.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Every day, I felt
stronger and stronger.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things that I
experienced when I was younger,

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I started to release and
let go through practicing

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:90%
more and more yoga.

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the more
yoga that I practiced,

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
the more I was able
to release the past

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and step into my strength
as a person, as a teacher,

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:90%
and as a leader.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.915 align:middle line:84%
And so the more that I
started to teach and lead,

00:26:46.915 --> 00:26:48.290 align:middle line:84%
the more people
that came around.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It was like, wow,
this is awesome.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would just continue
to teach and teach.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, my
platform grew on Instagram,

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and I started to do these
once-a-month dinner parties.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And at the dinner parties, I
would do a five-course dinner,

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and then I would promote my
yoga classes during the week.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And each month, they
got bigger and bigger.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And my yoga classes got
more and more popular.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, people would
just come to me for advice.

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, what am I supposed
to do when this happens?

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to do?

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
set up sessions.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:90%
I would do live coaching.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And just more than
anything, remind people,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:90%
take care of yourself.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, just like
me, going hard at athletics,

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:84%
so hard that I depleted myself,
and now I'm not able to do it.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people
go hard at their career,

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.950 align:middle line:90%
go hard at parenting.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And without taking
the care of yourself,

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.760 align:middle line:84%
you really can't
take care of others.

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So one of the biggest
things I teach

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:90%
is self-love and self-care.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.990 align:middle line:84%
The more you take
care of yourself,

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.190 align:middle line:84%
the more energy you're going
to have to pour into others.

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Fill your cup and then serve
others from the overflow.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:84%
That's something one of my
favorite speakers always says.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:90%
She's Lisa Nichols.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.890 align:middle line:84%
She's just like, you're supposed
to serve from your saucer.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.158 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you become
depleted, and you

00:28:04.158 --> 00:28:05.700 align:middle line:84%
have to really,
really fill your cup.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So that was something
that I carried with me,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and I started to
teach people really

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
how to take these tools that
I've learned through yoga,

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:84%
meditation,
affirmations, and take

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:84%
it to use to build themselves
up so that when they get

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that rejection, when they
suffer from a breakup, when they

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
suffer from loss in the
family, they're able to cope,

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:84%
pick themselves up, and just
continue to live their purpose.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> So beautiful.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:29.310 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And what does it feel like
now, reflecting on your life,

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and thinking back to this
young, enthusiastic, sometimes

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
25 pounds overweight
Koya growing up, and just

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to think that now you're in
a heart-centered yogic path

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:84%
to help open people's
hearts and minds,

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and help them connect to
what's important in life?

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.980 align:middle line:84%
What does it feel like
for you, reflecting back

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.080 align:middle line:84%
on your upbringing, to
think that now that's

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.790 align:middle line:90%
what you get to do?

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just humbled.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:84%
I feel so humbled that I
get to travel the world.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I've been to so many countries,
from Jamaica, to Bali,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:90%
to Thai--

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.730 align:middle line:84%
all these different cultures I
get to experience, and things

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.500 align:middle line:84%
that I get to do, and
I thought I wouldn't

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.110 align:middle line:84%
get to do that unless I
had an Olympic gold medal,

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:18.960 align:middle line:84%
or I was a famous
model or singer.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But here I am, just a
young girl from Tennessee

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:84%
who decided to use her
voice and use her life

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:26.650 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't believe that
I get to work with celebrities.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I get to
travel to these places.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe the
amount of impact

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that I have now just because I
said yes to myself, and I said,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.003 align:middle line:90%
I am enough just as I am.

00:29:41.003 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
have a gold medal,

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
famous to be great.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I can just be great,
and do good things,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and help people, as many people.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And first it started out
as a handful of people,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and it just grew and grew and
grew through social media,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that's a
platform to share my story,

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and share the things that
I've learned that have helped

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.530 align:middle line:90%
me live a healthier life.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just so
humbled that now, I

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.500 align:middle line:84%
get to enjoy this life of
travel, and of sharing,

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and of living a
heart-centered life,

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and a very purposeful
life doing what I love.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So beautiful.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And how's it feel?

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you mentioned
Lisa Nichols.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.318 align:middle line:84%
I've shared the stage
somewhat at Awesomeness Fest

00:30:22.318 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:84%
with her a number of years
ago where I first met.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.818 align:middle line:84%
We were just actually in touch
with her team the other day.

00:30:26.818 --> 00:30:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But to me, women have to
overcome so much these days.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And then someone
growing up in the South

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.310 align:middle line:90%
has to overcome even more.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:84%
How does it feel for you to
be a representation of women

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
globally, to be
able to show them

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that you can live a life
full of love and abundance,

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:46.470 align:middle line:84%
you can live a life doing
something that you are

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:90%
passionate about, such as yoga.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
what message would

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
you have to women that are
watching this that sometimes

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
don't give themselves the
love, or the self-authority,

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:04.230 align:middle line:84%
or the permission to do what
they're truly passionate about?

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>> One big message that I would
give those women is no one can

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.470 align:middle line:90%
love you better than you.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:84%
No one can love you
better than you.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So you have to love
yourself first and most,

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and just know it's
not being selfish.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It is really giving yourself
what you need so you can really

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.350 align:middle line:90%
take care of others.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.990 align:middle line:90%
A lot of us-- myself included--

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I was a yes girl, always
overextending myself.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes, you
end up resentful, like, oh,

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:32.310 align:middle line:90%
why did I do this again?

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you take
care of yourself,

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:90%
you know how to create balance.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.830 align:middle line:84%
You know how to
create boundaries.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And so that self-love
is so important.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that's the
biggest thing lacking.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.190 align:middle line:84%
We're always looking outside
of ourself, like I did.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, how can I be great?

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.450 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to be--

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.340 align:middle line:84%
even though I did
those things, it

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:84%
came from a place of
always looking to feel love

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.610 align:middle line:90%
and accepted.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But through yoga, I learned
to love and accept myself

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.045 align:middle line:90%
as I was.

00:31:58.045 --> 00:31:59.430 align:middle line:90%
The other way, I was like--

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was fun, but
I would get injured.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:90%
I would push too hard.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:90%
I would try too hard.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And with yoga, it gave me
this sense of self-acceptance.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.033 align:middle line:90%
I just accepted myself.

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I remember I went
through a whole period

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
where I didn't
accept my hair, and I

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.985 align:middle line:84%
felt like I wanted
it to be different.

00:32:15.985 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But through yoga,
I was like, you

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.980 align:middle line:84%
know what, it's
beautiful just as it is.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be amazed at how
much people, like, oh, yeah,

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:90%
affirmations.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I love myself.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:28.980 align:middle line:84%
But you will be amazed how
saying those affirmations,

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:84%
closing your eyes and feeling
those affirmations day

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.860 align:middle line:84%
after day after day, they
really start to sink in.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Doing the mirror work,
looking at yourself

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and saying these things,
it really does work.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I would just tell
these women, just do the work.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Take care of yourself,
love yourself,

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and you will be amazed
at what comes out of it.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it will be a
stronger, more empowered woman,

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.326 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what I experienced.

00:32:54.326 --> 00:32:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:32:55.450 --> 00:33:00.100 align:middle line:84%
What does a daily self-care
ritual look like for somebody?

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Give me a day in
the life of someone

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.340 align:middle line:84%
who's really looking
after themselves?

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.540 align:middle line:84%
What's the first thing
they do when they wake up?

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.665 align:middle line:84%
Is it check social media,
or is it go in the mirror

00:33:06.665 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:90%
and say, you got this, honey?

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.070 align:middle line:90%
And then what do they do?

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a bit--

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can definitely be a
little guilty of a social media

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:17.740 align:middle line:84%
check here and there, but I feel
like on my most mindful days,

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I wake up--

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I like to wake up
and just sun gaze.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So if I wake up before
the sun, I usually

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:31.180 align:middle line:84%
meditate and pray first thing,
first thing when I wake up.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.060 align:middle line:84%
If the sun is up before me, I
usually just gaze at the sun.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I love to sun gaze, and just
take in the energy of the sun.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:38.800 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.820 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't heard of
sun gazing, look it up.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.280 align:middle line:90%
It's real, it's a thing.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:84%
You get the energy from
your sun, and it is--

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:84%
man, the first time
I did it was amazing,

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and now I do it as
much as possible.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.530 align:middle line:90%
You really bring the energy in.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:53.275 align:middle line:84%
So sun gazing, meditation
in the morning,

00:33:53.275 --> 00:33:54.400 align:middle line:90%
breath work in the morning.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.890 align:middle line:90%
Prayer is so important.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So I do those things
in the morning.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And then moving on to
liquid, just getting water.

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Water gives you energy.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And eating like a really
light breakfast, because we're

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.600 align:middle line:84%
fasting when we
sleep, so we want

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to break that fast
with water and liquid.

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So water in the
morning, of course,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.800 align:middle line:84%
after six to eight hours sleep,
which I too sometimes don't do.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I get four, or three.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.170 align:middle line:90%
But on my best days, I get six.

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, those
special days, I get eight.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.739 align:middle line:84%
But usually, with six, I
feel really good and vibrant.

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.270 align:middle line:84%
With my lifestyle,
with what I eat,

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel really great
and vibrant off six.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And then throughout the day,
just eating a plant-based diet

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:37.906 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:34:37.906 --> 00:34:39.489 align:middle line:84%
Eating a lot of
fruits and vegetables,

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:42.159 align:middle line:84%
because that's what's going to
give us that life force energy.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat a lot of dead
foods, things that really

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.870 align:middle line:90%
don't serve my energetic being.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I eat a lot of living
foods, a lot of life.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
really important.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think finding
some type of movement,

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.155 align:middle line:84%
whether it be dance, or yoga,
or fitness training, whatever

00:34:59.155 --> 00:35:00.780 align:middle line:84%
you love to do find,
some way to move--

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.860 align:middle line:84%
or playing with kids
outside in the park.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.773 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, find
something that you're

00:35:04.773 --> 00:35:06.940 align:middle line:84%
moving your body, because
we have this energy called

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.510 align:middle line:84%
chi energy, and we have to move
our body so that we're alive.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're
just sitting dead,

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.770 align:middle line:84%
reaching for a cup
of coffee, and trying

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to get this life through
eating, which really--

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.380 align:middle line:84%
food is more fuel,
but we get energy

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:90%
out of moving and breathing.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So moving and breathing
every single day.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Eating plant-based foods.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:90%
And just smiling at people.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.850 align:middle line:84%
I feel like this
oneness that we have,

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:84%
this energy that we have
looking in someone else's eyes,

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.030 align:middle line:84%
seeing their soul, seeing who
they truly are, that's life.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.190 align:middle line:90%
That's living.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Gorgeous.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:42.250 align:middle line:84%
What are some other
self-care rituals

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
that people can try or
integrate into their lives?

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that I love to do
when I get off of a plane is go

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.260 align:middle line:90%
floating.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.633 align:middle line:84%
So there's this float tank in
Marina Del Rey called Pause,

00:35:54.633 --> 00:35:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's just like you're
pausing in your day.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:84%
You go in, they
have infrared sauna.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.970 align:middle line:84%
They have these float
pods where you're

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.870 align:middle line:84%
in 500 pounds of Epsom
salt. Lights off.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:08.530 align:middle line:84%
The pod closes, and you're
pretty much in meditation

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.450 align:middle line:90%
for an entire hour.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And during these pauses, I have
the best visions, and it's--

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
one hour's equivalent to
a full night of sleep.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a great way to
relax your body, to destress.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.960 align:middle line:84%
All the salt really
infuses into your muscles.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I cannot wait to go.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Tonight I'm either going to
go to the jacuzzi or to Pause,

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.023 align:middle line:90%
because it's really great.

00:36:34.023 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And then jacuzzi is another
thing that I like to do.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Getting in the
whirlpool, swimming.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Water is so powerful
when it comes

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.945 align:middle line:90%
to rehabilitation and healing.

00:36:42.945 --> 00:36:43.820 align:middle line:90%
I tell almost anyone.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.745 align:middle line:84%
If you're experiencing
any type of bodily injury,

00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and you can get into the
water, get into the water,

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:51.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's like
being in the womb,

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to
rehabilitate yourself.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So that's one thing that
I did during my injuries.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Every injury that
I recover from,

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I use water to help me heal,
because it's a weightless way

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to just get your
body back to 100%.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Growing up and moving
through your life,

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.720 align:middle line:84%
obviously dealing-- you talked
about dealing with past trauma.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's dealing
with trauma, right?

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.130 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
happens as we grow up,

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.963 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through
trauma or experiences--

00:37:16.963 --> 00:37:18.505 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you want
share a little bit

00:37:18.505 --> 00:37:20.620 align:middle line:84%
about that-- we start to
develop limiting beliefs

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.140 align:middle line:84%
about ourselves and
about what's possible.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And those beliefs are things
that can suddenly hold us back

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:middle line:90%
from achieving our greatness.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to any
sort of beliefs or trauma

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.460 align:middle line:84%
that you've had
to personally work

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.163 align:middle line:84%
through that helped you
unlock more of your potential

00:37:36.163 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:84%
because of the time you
spent working on that?

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:90%
I think one of the things--

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.790 align:middle line:84%
one of the reoccurring limiting
beliefs that I would have

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:90%
is that I'm not good enough.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I can't do this because
I'm not good enough.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the skills
someone else has,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.220 align:middle line:84%
or the opportunities,
or things like that.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And that held me back a lot.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:03.160 align:middle line:84%
In growing up, every time
I overcame that feeling

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and just did the work--
when I played basketball,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.070 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm good enough.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Then I did well.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And track and field.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Once I said, I can
overcome this, I did.

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.850 align:middle line:84%
In life, once I said, you know
what, I can make a difference,

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:18.190 align:middle line:90%
I started to grow.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.670 align:middle line:90%
And even now, I love to sing.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:24.610 align:middle line:84%
But so many times I'm like,
well, I'm no Mariah Carey.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I always
held back because I

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel like I was
the greatest singer,

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.900 align:middle line:84%
but I love to sing,
and I love music.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think music
is a beautiful way

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.680 align:middle line:90%
to spread love, and express.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And so next month, I'm actually
releasing my first single.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the theme song
for "Get Loved Up,"

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and I cannot wait to
share it to the world.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was me
conquering my fear,

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and not being like, I'm not
good enough, but saying,

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.380 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I am good
enough, because I have a voice,

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.340 align:middle line:90%
and I can use it.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that same
confidence helped

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.450 align:middle line:84%
me become the woman
that I am today,

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:03.765 align:middle line:84%
just realizing that
as you are is perfect.

00:39:03.765 --> 00:39:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can just get
better and better,

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.970 align:middle line:84%
but you are good
enough as you are.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:10.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing I had to keep
telling myself, my affirmation.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I am beautiful as I am.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I am worthy as I am.

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.070 align:middle line:90%
I am enough.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Those affirmations really
helped me get through a lot,

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:90%
and just realize--

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, especially being
a model, you're ridiculed.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.140 align:middle line:90%
You're too this, you're--

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was growing
up, it's you're too skinny.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And then I put on muscle, and
I went out to model again.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It was like, oh, you're too big.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like,
ugh, God, I can't.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:90%
You're too dark.

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, you
need a darker one.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:37.050 align:middle line:90%
You're too light.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was always like, too
skinny, too dark, too big,

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.140 align:middle line:90%
too fat, and just--

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I had to
learn to love myself.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Because at first, I was always
trying to be just right,

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and I realized I'll never
be exactly what everyone

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:90%
wants me to be.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:53.358 align:middle line:84%
I just have to be comfortable
with myself in my own skin.

00:39:53.358 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And when I learned that--

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was trying to
get on the cover of "Oxygen

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Magazine."

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be a certain
weight, and a certain size,

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.145 align:middle line:90%
and you have big boobs.

00:40:04.145 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And people would ask me, are
you going to get a boob job?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I was like, no, I've
never ever fantasized

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:09.790 align:middle line:90%
about having a boob job.

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.678 align:middle line:84%
Some people do and that's their
thing, but I was like, no way.

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm not
going to do that.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll do everything else.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.430 align:middle line:90%
I joined a fitness competition.

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.280 align:middle line:84%
I won fitness model called
Model America, and all

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.210 align:middle line:84%
these competitions, which I
never thought I'd be on stage,

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:29.020 align:middle line:84%
but I did it because I
wanted this end result.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, didn't
make it on the cover.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.720 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until two years later
when I finally embraced myself.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I used to wear these
long, elaborate wigs.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And I still love wigs for fun,
for costume, for character.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of fun.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.480 align:middle line:84%
But at one point,
I realized I had

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:90%
a drawer full of about 40 wigs.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I took them off,
I was like, ugh, my hair.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I did not love what
was underneath.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.540 align:middle line:90%
And the problem is not the wig.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
The problem is not
loving what's underneath.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Or not loving myself without it.

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.675 align:middle line:84%
So once I realized that, I
was just like, you know what?

00:41:01.675 --> 00:41:02.550 align:middle line:90%
I got to let this go.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
I got to fall in
love with my hair.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:04.925 align:middle line:90%
So I went on YouTube.

00:41:04.925 --> 00:41:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I look at all these
natural hair tutorials,

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:08.510 align:middle line:90%
and I learned how to do my hair.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Fell in love with my
hair, and it was great.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually decided
to lock my hair how it is now,

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's like the best
thing I've ever done,

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:90%
but it's my natural hair.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And though I will wear a
Afro wig or any type of wig

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:84%
in the future, but it'll
be out of creating art,

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and not because I don't
love the hair on my head.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:32.003 align:middle line:84%
So I just feel like learning to
love myself as I am has been--

00:41:32.003 --> 00:41:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and feel like that I'm worth
it has been a big reoccurring

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.230 align:middle line:90%
theme in my life.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like anyone
that feels that they're not

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:84%
good enough, or they're
not beautiful enough,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.850 align:middle line:84%
should just look in the mirror
and realize that we are all

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:44.770 align:middle line:84%
unique and different
and beautiful,

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's what makes
the world beautiful.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.682 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to look alike.

00:41:48.682 --> 00:41:50.140 align:middle line:84%
We're not all
supposed to be alike.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:54.347 align:middle line:84%
We just have to really learn to
love and acceptance ourselves.

00:41:54.347 --> 00:41:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You couldn't have
said that better.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.350 align:middle line:90%
You're great at this.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So tell me about what
you're up to now,

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:84%
what are you up to next,
and what's the future

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.410 align:middle line:90%
for Koya Webb looks like?

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's next is my
company Get Loved Up,

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.480 align:middle line:84%
which our mantra is love
yourself, love others,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:90%
love the planet.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It's really about
self-love and self-care,

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.250 align:middle line:84%
oneness, unity,
sharing with others,

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.560 align:middle line:84%
and doing the best we
can to make the world

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.140 align:middle line:84%
a better place, a
healthier place to live in.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm expanding.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I just started doing
yoga teacher trainings

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.080 align:middle line:84%
where I'm teaching the
yoga, the meditation,

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.360 align:middle line:84%
the plant-based
nutrition, everything

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.150 align:middle line:84%
you need to do to live
a healthy lifestyle.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm certifying
other teachers.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have
Get Loved Up instructors

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
spreading this love,

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:44.170 align:middle line:84%
producing a lot of
online content for myself

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:45.500 align:middle line:90%
and for other companies.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And my goal is just
to spread the love.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Have everyone getting loved
up in every single city.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a huge
Get Loved Up community.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And I want to just keep
spreading and sharing them

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:58.530 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:42:59.990 align:middle line:90%
I love it, pardon the pun.

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> So OK, final question now.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So we're back in
the backstage room.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm karate chopping you,
getting it pumped up.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe doing your power move
or something, I don't know.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
You're getting pumped to go out,
and outside there is the world.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.740 align:middle line:90%
All the broadcasters.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's there.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And you've got
one or two minutes

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to share with them your message
for humanity about what it

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:28.430 align:middle line:84%
might take to inspire them to
live a healthier, happier life,

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.620 align:middle line:84%
to really truly tap
into the potential

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:32.298 align:middle line:90%
that they have within them.

00:43:32.298 --> 00:43:33.590 align:middle line:90%
What would you share with them?

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.000 align:middle line:90%
That's so good!

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.880 align:middle line:90%
What would I share with them?

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:90%
You are love.

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And everyone wants to love and
be love at the end of the day.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:52.460 align:middle line:84%
There are going
to be challenges.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.520 align:middle line:84%
There are going to be
fears that come up.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But when we're
challenged, if we just

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:05.070 align:middle line:84%
remember that those challenges
are meant to make us stronger.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Not to defeat us, but
to make us stronger.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And those fears are meant
to push us closer and closer

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:16.740 align:middle line:90%
to love, not away from it.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But they happen-- just
like lifting weights,

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.090 align:middle line:90%
they happen to strengthen us.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And if we can remember
that, I feel like we

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.990 align:middle line:90%
can live in a healthier world.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.040 align:middle line:90%
