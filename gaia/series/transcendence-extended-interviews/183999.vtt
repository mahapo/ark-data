00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:06.078 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.078 --> 00:00:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And today I have an
extra-special guest for you.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.020 align:middle line:90%
His name is John Robbins.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And he has impacted
me personally,

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and my mom, and our family
in such a unique way.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Early on in our journey, when we
were researching about the best

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.100 align:middle line:84%
nutrition, the best way to
eat to help my father get well

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and also help save the planet,
we came across a book called

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:90%
"Diet For a New America."

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.493 align:middle line:84%
This book, I gave
to my dad to read,

00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:84%
going through his illness, but
he wasn't really interested

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.838 align:middle line:90%
But my mom read it.

00:00:35.838 --> 00:00:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And mom and I had such
a special connection

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
over this book, the
stories about animals

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and the connection that humans
have to animals, and then

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.850 align:middle line:84%
the horrors of factory farming
and the mainstream meat

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.345 align:middle line:84%
and dairy production that's
happening these days,

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and the many
benefits that we can

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
get from eliminating too
many man-made, processed

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
foods in our diet and
returning to a natural diet.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:84%
John is a trailblazer
when it comes

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
to the health of
wellness industry.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And now him and his
son, Ocean Robbins,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
have started the Food
Revolution Network.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And together they
are helping light

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.377 align:middle line:84%
up more and more people
each and every year.

00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And as you would
know at Food Matters,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:90%
we're huge fans of their work.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pleasure to be
speaking to John today.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> James.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> How you doing?

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Glad you're here, and we
can have this conversation.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So to begin with, I'd
like to know a little bit

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.140 align:middle line:84%
about what it was like being
John Robbins as a kid--

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
as a 6-year-old,
as a 10-year-old,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
where did you grow up, and what
was life like at those times?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well as a 6-year-old, I
actually had polio when I was

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:84%
six, and I was in a wheelchair
when I was six years old.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned 6, and that's
the memory that comes back.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.100 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said I would be in a
wheelchair the rest of my life.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was that I
did spend about a year that way,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
but then I started to regain
some feeling in my legs,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and some movement-- more in
the right leg than the left.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And I could kind of get around,
but with a lot of limitation.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.773 align:middle line:90%
When I was 21, they said--

00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:15.940 align:middle line:84%
my left leg was three inches
shorter than the right.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.273 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't put any weight on it.

00:02:17.273 --> 00:02:20.200 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very gimpy,
and I limped badly.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.115 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors said, well,
your growing years are over now,

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to live with this.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.282 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, when I heard

00:02:27.282 --> 00:02:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that, I don't think you know
as much as you think you know,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not accepting
that prognosis.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And I began then
to change my life.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And I walked away from my
dad's company at that point.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Because he had planned
my life for me--

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:90%
or for him.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was a path
paved in rocky road ice

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:90%
cream and a lot of money.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Because my dad and my uncle
had founded Baskin-Robbins

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:84%
31 flavors, which became, in my
childhood, the world's largest

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:90%
ice cream company.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It was a multibillion
dollar company,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:90%
and my dad and uncle owned it.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm an only son, so my dad
had groomed me to succeed him

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:90%
that was his plan.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was used to
getting what he wanted.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:90%
He was a doer.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
He knew how to manifest
stuff, and he did.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:90%
He built this ice cream empire.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:84%
My uncle, his business partner,
my dad's brother-in-law,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
died of a heart attack
at the age of 54.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:90%
He was a very big guy.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:90%
He ate a lot of ice cream.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And when he died,
I asked my dad,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
do you think there could be a
connection between the amount

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.590 align:middle line:84%
of ice cream that Burt Baskin
ate and his fatal heart attack?

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said, no, his
ticker just got tired

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and stopped working.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And then he looked at
me in a certain way.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And if I could
translate that look,

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
it said, don't ever
mention that again.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was a psychologist--
a famous psychologist named

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:84%
John Bradshaw who
spoke about families

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:84%
that have a "no talk" rule
about certain taboo topics.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's dad's drinking, maybe
it's something that they just

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
can't talk about.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
It was too painful to, and
so they don't go there.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:90%
And they learn to suppress that.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, in my family
of origin, it was

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.773 align:middle line:84%
that there might be a connection
between ice cream and disease,

00:04:23.773 --> 00:04:25.690 align:middle line:84%
or heart disease in
particular, because that's

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.130 align:middle line:90%
what killed my uncle.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, OK, I
understand why my dad doesn't

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:90%
want to talk about that.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:90%
By that time, he had sold--

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.830 align:middle line:84%
he had manufactured
more ice cream

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.788 align:middle line:84%
than anybody who had ever
lived on this planet.

00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to think
that the product was killing

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:90%
anybody or hurting anybody.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.410 align:middle line:84%
But I suspected it might not be
the best thing for our health

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
to eat ice cream or
eat a lot of ice cream.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in
the business, you

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:90%
want people to eat a lot of it.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the business model.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And he had groomed
me to succeed him.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.398 align:middle line:90%
I'd invented flavors.

00:05:00.398 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I invented one called
Jamocha Almond Fudge.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.145 align:middle line:90%
It became a huge flavor.

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> What was that called again?

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Jamocha almond fudge.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a coffee ice cream with
a chocolate ribbon in it

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.060 align:middle line:90%
and bits of almonds.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:90%
But it became very popular.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.928 align:middle line:90%
And I loved inventing flavors.

00:05:16.928 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:90%
I loved eating ice cream.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:90%
What kid doesn't?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:90%
And we had unlimited amounts.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
We had an ice-cream-cone-shaped
swimming pool in our backyard.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.700 align:middle line:90%
I swam in it.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I had ice cream for
breakfast sometimes.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't well.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I had had the polio, I
was ill, I was frail.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I was not emotionally
well, not physically well.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around,
most members of my family

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.530 align:middle line:84%
were very heavy, and
I started to think

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that my uncle's death and
some other things that I saw--

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to
think, I don't think

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to do what my
dad has planned for me,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
even though I was
enjoying working with him

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.003 align:middle line:84%
and the company was
a extravagant success

00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and there was really unlimited
amounts of ice cream,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:84%
and almost unlimited amounts
of money, actually, coming in.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
But I made a
decision then, and it

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
was a decision that defined
my life ever since, which

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.305 align:middle line:84%
was to walk away
from Baskin-Robbins

00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:23.430 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity to run
the company with my dad,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:90%
and eventually to inherit it.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I also chose,
out of integrity,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:90%
to walk away from the money.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:84%
So I told my dad,
because I'm not

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
going to do what
you want me to do,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
what you've planned
for me to do,

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it's honorable and
respectful to you and to me

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to not have any access to
your money, which has come

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.880 align:middle line:90%
from the ice cream company.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So I lived very simply
after that with my wife.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
We've been married
for 51 years now.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And she was part of
that decision with me.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And I walked away from
the company, the money,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
and led a very
different life, and came

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
to really look into is there
a connection between ice cream

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and heart disease, what is
the real health consequences

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:90%
of the standard American diet?

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of born into the
great American food machine.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I was born with
a front row seat.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had opportunities
that most people don't have,

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
including the opportunity to
see what that kind of wealth--

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:84%
most of us really
aspire for that.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.870 align:middle line:90%
We want that.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:84%
We think, if we had that,
our lives would be marvelous.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And yes, wealth
gives you options.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But whether you can take
advantage of those options

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's
spiritually fulfilling,

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
that's of service to
life, to yourself,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
to others depends on
your consciousness,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
and your integrity, and your
ethics, and your values.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a society that
values the materialism too

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:90%
much.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It hurts all of us,
including the wealthy.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I lived among them, and
I was one of them growing up,

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and I chose to walk
away from that,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
not because I'm a fan of
poverty for a second--

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
I am not-- but
because some people,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
they're so poor all
they have is money,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:84%
and there's an emptiness inside,
and their souls are broken.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And even though they
have all the power that

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.650 align:middle line:84%
comes with great
wealth, they don't

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.485 align:middle line:84%
know how to use it in a
way that uplifts anybody.

00:08:45.485 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to use it to create

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.568 align:middle line:84%
more beauty in the world, to
create more love in the world,

00:08:49.568 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:84%
to create more opportunities
for people in the world.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:90%
They don't know how to do that.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:84%
So they end up buying
$50 million Ferraris

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.260 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, or possibly
even worse, they

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
use it to purchase political
power that they then

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:84%
use to further build their
fortunes at the expense

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:90%
of the common good.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is a tragedy
of our times, I think.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't want to be
a part of that at all,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't been.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> What was it--

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:90%
thank you so much.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:84%
It's been a beautiful
share about the story,

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:90%
and that's perfect.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
What was it like--

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
because I can relate in
a very different way.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
My father was an accountant,
and he was not home,

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
he was never there at school
meetings with the parents

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and children, and he was
building his business,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.090 align:middle line:90%
building his wealth.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's the one thing
he had control over

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and he knew how to do.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But it was at the cost
of the relationship

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:90%
with my myself and my brother.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%
My dad was not present.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was a very
emotional detachment

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
throughout most
of our upbringing.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
You talk about how your father
was building this machine.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.810 align:middle line:84%
What was it like
emotionally in your house,

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.830 align:middle line:84%
or the relationship you
had with your father?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my dad was all about
building Baskin-Robbins.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
He worked 80 hours
a week doing it.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't really have
a relationship with him

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
much other than
through the business.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
But I started working
at Baskin-Robbins

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:90%
when I was 5 years old.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all I did then
was sweep the floor

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:90%
or empty the waste baskets.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But he wanted me to learn the
business from the inside out.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So as I got older, he would
give me age-appropriate jobs.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I worked in
the factory where

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:90%
ice cream was manufactured.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I worked in franchising
where the stores

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:90%
were located and sold.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.020 align:middle line:84%
I worked in advertising
and marketing.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I worked in all the
departments of the business--

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
sourcing the ingredients,
developing flavors.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
relationship to my dad,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
was we would drive
together-- he would drive,

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:90%
because I was a kid--

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
to the office together,
and then we'd drive home.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:90%
We'd talk about the business.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:84%
That was my
relationship to my dad.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.848 align:middle line:84%
I hardly knew him
other than that.

00:11:16.848 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
his life was all about.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
he wanted with me.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have much interest
in anything about my feelings

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:84%
or thoughts other
than what did I

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
think about the next
flavor or something

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.605 align:middle line:90%
to do with the company.

00:11:35.605 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And I actually liked it.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.203 align:middle line:90%
I was rather thrilled.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
He was really good
at what he did.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:90%
He was really focused.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
His ability to concentrate
was amazing, kind of yogic

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
in a way, although it
didn't have the values

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:90%
of caring for others.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Although he wanted
to make people happy,

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:90%
and he thought ice cream did.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one
year, we came out

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.840 align:middle line:84%
with an advertising slogan
that was the centerpiece

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:90%
of all the ads that year.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was "we
make people happy."

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:90%
He loved the slogan.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And I remember saying
to him, I don't like it,

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
make people happy.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Human happiness is
an existential issue.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
It arises out of how we
treat each other, the quality

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
of our lives, of
our relationships,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.580 align:middle line:90%
of our work and service.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, you're
being a philosopher.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:90%
This is an advertising slogan.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
but it's not true.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
We provide a product that
provides momentary pleasure.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And people can celebrate
that, but momentary pleasure

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and human happiness
are different things.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle line:84%
To me, that was an existential
reality of significance.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
To him, that was an annoyance
that I was talking that way.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't always see
eye to eye on things.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And in time, I began to
realize that's because we

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:90%
have different values.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And as my own values
began to emerge

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:84%
in my teen years and late teen
years, I began to realize--

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.200 align:middle line:90%
I was a product of the '60s.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
I had the opportunity to work
with Dr. Martin Luther King.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:90%
I marched with him.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
I went to Alabama and
Mississippi to be with him

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and participate in the
Civil Rights movement.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I was a kid from the
north, I was a white kid,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
but to me that was
history happening.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
To me, that was an opportunity
to be part of something,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
to witness something that
was of immense significance.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
To me, the racism in our
society was abhorrent.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.532 align:middle line:84%
My dad thought, you're
trying to rock the boat,

00:13:50.532 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
they have their own
culture in the south,

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.615 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't go down there,
you should leave them alone,

00:13:54.615 --> 00:13:55.970 align:middle line:90%
they don't want you.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't see eye
to eye on that either.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
the war in Vietnam.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was a
ridiculously stupid idea,

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:84%
the war, and cruel, and
a waste of resources,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and terribly, terribly
damaging to our soldiers

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
but to the people of
Vietnam most significantly.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Everybody involved got hurt.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And I opposed the war.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:90%
I protested it.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:90%
My dad was in favor of it.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So we had our
differences in values.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
understand that for me

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to, even though I loved my dad
and respected his achievements

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
tremendously, for me to
follow in his footsteps, which

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is what he wanted, I would
have lost my integrity.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I would have lost
my soul in some way.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I'm
here on this earth

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.350 align:middle line:90%
to do, invent a 32nd flavor.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.232 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying, well,
you could take stores

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
world, and you could

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:90%
build the company even bigger.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
yeah, so what?

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:90%
Why would I-- yes, I could.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've built
something powerful, big, strong.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
I could continue that.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But there was something in
my heart that just said,

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
that would be lucrative, that
path is paved with gold and ice

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:31.390 align:middle line:84%
cream, the other path is really
confusing, awkward, strange.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know where it will lead.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I just have to put one
foot in front of the other,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and take it a day
at a time, and see

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:84%
what unfolds, and try to get
into alignment with my spirit,

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:48.970 align:middle line:84%
with my wholeness, with the
greater good of our world,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
with the fact that
we are inextricably

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:84%
interwoven with the
whole earth community.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And I really felt
called, honestly,

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:84%
to live a very different
life than the one he

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.920 align:middle line:90%
had planned for me.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was so painful, because
how do you say no to something

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.210 align:middle line:84%
My dad thought I was
crazy to walk away

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
from that kind of money
into a life of insecurity.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is,
for me, when I walked

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.420 align:middle line:84%
away from the
financial security,

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I became more emotionally
secure, ironically,

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
because I now was
listening to and trying

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:37.520 align:middle line:84%
to abide by and express
the gifts within me,

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and the understandings and
love in my heart for life,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to just
seeking the dollar.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Our society teaches us that
that's what success is.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:84%
When we say somebody is
a success, usually what

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
we mean by that term is that
they've made a lot of money

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:90%
or they have a lot of money.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:90%
That's a success.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a very
impoverished view of success.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I think a successful
human being-- well,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:84%
we probably all have to
define that for ourselves.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:84%
But for me, anyway, I
define success for myself

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.957 align:middle line:84%
as living in harmony
with my spirit

00:17:15.957 --> 00:17:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit of others,
living with respect for myself

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and others, living with
respect for creation,

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
for this beautiful, endangered,
fragile, crazy world, and messy

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:90%
world, but loving it anyway.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
where I find my heart.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Very beautiful.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I'd like if we could spend a
short moment, John, closing

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.820 align:middle line:84%
the loop on this story before
we get into some of the details

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
just on the meat
and dairy industry,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:84%
because we could
maybe finish there.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.323 align:middle line:84%
Because you touched on
some beautiful points

00:17:49.323 --> 00:17:51.660 align:middle line:84%
around fulfillment, and
happiness, and success

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:84%
there, which I had
planned as well.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.002 align:middle line:84%
So in short, if we
could go through this,

00:17:58.002 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
you moved to Vancouver
Island, you went off the grid,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
you did some research,
you uncovered

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that the processed food industry
was causing a lot of harm.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, in the
craziest way possible,

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.620 align:middle line:90%
your dad found the book--

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>> --and got well.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to take
close that loop.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so after I left, my
wife and I moved to a little

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.970 align:middle line:84%
island off the coast
of British Columbia,

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:90%
built a one-room log cabin.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:90%
It's all we could afford.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:90%
I did most of the work.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And we lived there for 10
years, and we grew our own food.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:90%
We were novices.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:90%
We made a lot of mistakes.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.520 align:middle line:90%
It was rugged.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But we were trying to
weave ourselves back

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
into the web of life,
and send our roots down

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:90%
into the natural world.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I had grown up in what I
maybe flippantly called

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.030 align:middle line:90%
an air-conditioned nightmare.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.810 align:middle line:84%
In my family of origin, roughing
it meant room service was late.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But now we were
really roughing it.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
We were living
very, very simply.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was beautiful
and it was tough.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.362 align:middle line:84%
And I eventually wrote
"Diet for a New America,"

00:18:58.362 --> 00:18:59.320 align:middle line:90%
the book you mentioned.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:90%
It was my first book.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:90%
And I sent it to my dad.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
By that time, we weren't
talking too much.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.040 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of distance.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I had made my
decision, my choice.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:90%
And he was hurt.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.520 align:middle line:84%
I tried to do it with
as much respect for him

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:90%
as I possibly could.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, I was
rejecting his life work,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and that was a sad thing,
and he was angry about it.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:33.292 align:middle line:84%
So we let each other be mostly,
and didn't talk too much.

00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:84%
But I thought he
might want to know

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:90%
that I had published a book.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:90%
And so I sent him a copy.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:90%
He didn't open it.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:84%
My dad, at that time,
had become very ill.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:90%
He had diabetes.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:90%
He had very high blood pressure.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:90%
He had heart disease.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:90%
He was overweight.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
His diabetes was so
severe that the prognosis

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:84%
was but possible amputation
of a foot or even a leg,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and blindness.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And his blood pressure
was so out of control

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.483 align:middle line:84%
he had to take 10 what he
called "horse pills" every day.

00:20:04.483 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what they were.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.567 align:middle line:84%
But he'd been told that
he'd have to take them

00:20:07.567 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of his life.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he went
to his cardiologist,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:84%
and this was shortly after my
first book had been published,

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:90%
maybe six months after.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.722 align:middle line:84%
And it had been reviewed
in the "American Journal

00:20:21.722 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:90%
of Cardiology" very favorably.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And my dad went to
his cardiologist,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and the cardiologist leveled
with him and said, Mr. Robbins,

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:90%
you're a very sick man now.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And the best we
can do for you is

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.350 align:middle line:84%
try to juggle your
medications, try

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.808 align:middle line:84%
to control some of
the side effects

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that you're experiencing and
that are distressing you,

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and try to make your few
remaining years a little more

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.390 align:middle line:90%
comfortable.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.730 align:middle line:90%
And my dad was scared.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And then he said,
on the other hand,

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:84%
if you were willing to
change your lifestyle

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and what you eat, there might be
a different prognosis for you.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said, well,
what do you mean?

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And the physician
handed him a copy

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.550 align:middle line:84%
of "Diet for a New
America," my book,

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that the John
Robbins who had written it

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
was the son of his patient, Irv
Robbins, the founder and owner

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of Baskin-Robbins.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
He of course knew who my dad
was and what his profession was,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
but it's a common last
name, and he didn't know.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And my dad of course
knew, because I'd sent him

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:90%
already a copy of the book.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't tell him.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But he went home, and
now, because the book

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
had been blessed by the high
priest of Western medicine,

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:90%
he began to read it.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you read the
copy the doctor gave him,

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.498 align:middle line:84%
not the copy I'd sent
him that was autographed.

00:21:48.498 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But he read it, and he started
to make changes, small ones

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:90%
at first.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:90%
But he got results.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And then he made more changes,
more results, more changes,

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.610 align:middle line:90%
more results.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Fast-forward two
years, he's off all

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.350 align:middle line:90%
the medications he'd been on.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:84%
His diabetes has gone
into complete remission.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't need insulin anymore.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't even need
diabetic pills anymore.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:84%
His circulation to his
legs and feet is restored

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:90%
and to his eyes is restored.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:84%
He's lost the weight
that he needed to lose.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.240 align:middle line:84%
His golf game has
improved by eight strokes.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And he's thrilled, and
the doctor's thrilled,

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and he calls me up and
says, Johnny, you're

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.710 align:middle line:84%
not going to believe
what's happened.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, what's happened?

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's unbelievable.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I said, all right,
what's unbelievable?

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.840 align:middle line:84%
It's really not possible,
but it's happened.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:90%
What, dad?

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
you were right.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, that my
dad who had achieved

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:84%
this phenomenal
business success could

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
say to the son that rejected
his life work that he

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:84%
might have been
right about anything,

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:90%
I respect that enormously.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Because that's of the
heart, that takes something.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:90%
This is a man who had it all.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:90%
He was a billionaire.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And yet he could say to his
son who walked away from it all

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:90%
that he might have been right.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, I'll
always live with that joy.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And then after that we
had a rapprochement.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
We began to talk
about a lot of things,

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.720 align:middle line:84%
there was a
reconciliation between us,

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
was completely renewed.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were still some
things we disagreed about,

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:90%
like politics.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
But the connection was
there, the love was there,

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.950 align:middle line:84%
the respect was there, both
ways, reciprocal, moving.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And we were connected again.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And he lived another
20 years, most of them

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:84%
very healthy ones, when
the prognosis had been he

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:90%
was on his deathbed.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So I love that I-- you
know, I disappointed him

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:17.160 align:middle line:84%
so much by making a choice that
I thought was for integrity,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
but from his point of view,
it was a slap in the face,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and that in the end I was able
to give him something perhaps

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
more valuable than had
I done the obvious thing

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and had invented a 32nd flavor.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Because then he would have died
20 years earlier than he did,

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and we would never have had that
kind of connection that we had.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I could relate to him
from my being, from my truth.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't placating him,
I wasn't accommodating,

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't just playing
into what he expected.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I was myself, and
he was himself.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
We had different paths in
life, and we loved each other.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.338 align:middle line:90%
And he'd given me life.

00:25:04.338 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:90%
He gave me a great start.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I was able to give
him something that I

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.430 align:middle line:84%
think was more meaningful
and important than--

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he didn't need
help building his business.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
He did that very
well on his own.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
So I love that I was able to
make that connection with him

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and help him regain his health.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
written other books,

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and sold millions
of copies of them,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and had many, many people
write me and tell me

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that their lives had been
changed in similar ways

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to my dad's, or relatives of
theirs had, as your dad was.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is so much more
rewarding and fulfilling for me

00:25:52.630 --> 00:26:00.010 align:middle line:90%
than had I been a billionaire.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we really need to define
redefine success in a way that

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:84%
includes our hearts,
and includes our love,

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and includes our compassion,
and includes our caring for one

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.100 align:middle line:90%
another.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's so it's not just about
a dog-eat-dog kind of thing.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, dogs don't
even eat dogs, in truth.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think we know when
we're a success when

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
our hearts are strong and
we live with them in a way.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And so our life
reflects our hearts.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
We make choices that express
our love, our caring, and that

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that becomes the defining
aspect of who we are.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, very beautiful.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Can I speak now to
a little bit more

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:84%
of the details of how, in
particular, meat has changed.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the parts of
the film, a common dialogue,

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.520 align:middle line:84%
is that for this huge
part of our evolution,

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
we've eaten fruits, vegetables,
nuts, seeds, tubers, et cetera,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and animal products, and liver,
and all these crazy things.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is an
element of truth to that.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And so people use that, and
they go and they consume meat.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
We've been understandably
consuming more meat and dairy

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:84%
than we have had
in recent history.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
That's one problem which we
can potentially speak to.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing I'd
like you to answer on

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.105 align:middle line:90%
is about how meat is changed.

00:27:27.105 --> 00:27:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Before we do that,
just for one second,

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
could you just say once
more, "and I wrote the book,

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:84%
'Diet for new America,'" because
you quickly said, after that,

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:90%
"as you mentioned."

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.460 align:middle line:84%
We might not be able to cut that
out, because it's very tight.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So could you say, once
more, "and I wrote the book,

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:40.063 align:middle line:90%
'Diet for a new America.'"

00:27:40.063 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And I wrote the book,
"Diet for a New America."

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad I remembered that.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, meat has changed.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So what used to be wild,
or this, or we'd hunt,

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:90%
and we'd get from rivers.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Meat has changed enormously,
and people don't realize this.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The industry doesn't
want you to know.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.150 align:middle line:84%
They actually have passed
legislation in various states

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:05.830 align:middle line:90%
in the United States--

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:90%
they're called ag gag bills--

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that prohibit taking
videos, taking cameras

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:20.717 align:middle line:84%
into these factory farms and
revealing what's going on.

00:28:20.717 --> 00:28:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I think the public
has a right to know

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:90%
how their food is produced.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But the people who are producing
it in a certain kind of way

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:90%
don't want the public to know.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Because they realize
that if the public saw it

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:34.720 align:middle line:90%
there'd be outrage.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm talking about is
modern meat, industrial meat.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's produced in
factory farms and feedlots.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:84%
We have images in our minds
of beef cattle or dairy cows

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:49.330 align:middle line:90%
grazing out in pasture land.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
what's done anymore.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:84%
There's some of that,
but it's a sliver.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It's 1%, if that, of meat
production, of dairy production

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.020 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:90%
And the animals are confined.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
They're not allowed
to move in many cases.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
That the thinking behind that
is movement burns energy,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.600 align:middle line:90%
burns calories.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And they want every
calorie of input, of feed,

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to go into producing
more meat to be sold.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:84%
They don't want any of it
wasted with the animal moving.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:90%
So they confine them.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:90%
They don't let them move.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.130 align:middle line:84%
That way they get fatter, like
people do if they're sedentary,

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.330 align:middle line:90%
don't ever move.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:90%
You get fatter.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And they feed them diets that
are completely unnatural.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:84%
I have been in cattle
operations where

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
they feed them cement dust
mixed into their feed.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's not healthy
for the animals at all.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.550 align:middle line:84%
They get sick, as
you would expect.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And the animals are sick.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:84%
They're obese, they're
sick, they're miserable.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.130 align:middle line:90%
But they're killed pretty young.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.030 align:middle line:90%
They get fat pretty quick.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.100 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole idea behind it.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And so their illness doesn't
cost the producers money.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, some die, but the
business model still works.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It works measured in dollars and
cents, which is how they think,

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:21.443 align:middle line:84%
but the price that the
animals pay is enormous.

00:30:21.443 --> 00:30:22.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be a vegetarian,

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.000 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be an
animal rights activist, you

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.740 align:middle line:84%
don't have to belong to PETA to,
if you see it, to be appalled.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.298 align:middle line:84%
Because most of us
want the animals--

00:30:35.298 --> 00:30:37.590 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to eat meat,
we want those animals to be

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:84%
treated well--
decently, anyway--

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to be slaughter humanely, to
live a life that's natural,

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and to be fed food that
is not going to make

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.770 align:middle line:90%
them intentionally obese.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Because what does that do to us?

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to measure misery in
a test tube, or quantify it.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But if people see how
modern meat is produced

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and how our modern dairy
products are produced,

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.290 align:middle line:84%
there's something that
goes on in most of us,

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:11.420 align:middle line:90%
it's just we're disgusted by it.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.160 align:middle line:84%
If you look at our past,
we were hunter-gatherers,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:84%
or gatherer-hunters,
depending on the ecosystem

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:90%
that our ancestors lived in.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And we ate what the
environment provided.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:84%
If we lived near a
lake, we ate fish.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.660 align:middle line:84%
If we lived near the ocean,
we were probably fishermen.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.110 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in the tropics,
we ate what was growing there.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in the
far north, we hunted.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.540 align:middle line:84%
But we ate seeds, we ate
insects, we ate nuts,

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.910 align:middle line:90%
we ate plants, mostly.

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:44.950 align:middle line:90%
We had a very high-fibrous diet.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the original plants
were much more high in fiber

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.010 align:middle line:90%
than plants are today.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:55.295 align:middle line:84%
And the animal products we eat
were mostly insects, and grubs,

00:31:55.295 --> 00:31:56.170 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.920 align:middle line:84%
But if we were able to catch
or kill a larger animal,

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.840 align:middle line:90%
those were wild animals.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
low in fat, and they

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
were particularly
low in the storage

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:11.290 align:middle line:84%
fats, the saturated fats that
we know are dangerous to us.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And their muscle
tissue was real.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they moved.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.360 align:middle line:84%
That's how they survived,
that's how they lived.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.083 align:middle line:84%
Today, though, modern meat
animals are living in feedlots,

00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:90%
are living in factory farms.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.750 align:middle line:90%
They are not allowed to move.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.988 align:middle line:84%
They don't develop
muscle tissue.

00:32:27.988 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:84%
They're very high in fat,
and it's mostly storage fats,

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.110 align:middle line:90%
highly saturated fats.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, in order to keep
these animals alive under these

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:84%
conditions-- these
conditions are so unnatural,

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:45.970 align:middle line:84%
the animals are so miserable,
that they have to inject them

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.850 align:middle line:84%
with antibiotics or
feed them antibiotics,

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes use hormones
as well and other chemicals--

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:56.120 align:middle line:84%
pesticides to kill
the flies that

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:90%
are around, and insecticides.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And so the meat
absorbs these poisons.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And then modern meat,
it's full of these things

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:84%
that our historical meat
didn't have, including misery.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
how you quantify misery.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But anyone who sees how these
animals live in industrial meat

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:31.400 align:middle line:84%
production dairy production
knows that they're miserable.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
misery on my menu.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is something
about that misery that

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:90%
gets passed on.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And also, they're
fed obesogenic diets,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
because the industry
wants them to gain weight

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:84%
as rapidly as possible, with
the least amount of food input.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So they want the "weight
gain to food input"

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.340 align:middle line:90%
ratio to be as high as possible.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The diet is designed for
that, and the animals

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:90%
have been bred for that.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we eat animals
that have been bred for that

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and that have been fed a
diet designed for that,

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.290 align:middle line:84%
is it any wonder,
then, that obesity

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.420 align:middle line:90%
is rampant in our culture?

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:14.670 align:middle line:90%
I think this contributes to it.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And when people say, oh,
but our ancestors ate meat,

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and then they go
down to the butcher

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.420 align:middle line:84%
or to McDonald's
and buy that, they

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.670 align:middle line:90%
don't realize how different--

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:34.280 align:middle line:84%
metabolically, nutritionally,
energetically--

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.268 align:middle line:84%
that meat that they're
buying is from the meat

00:34:38.268 --> 00:34:40.310 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about our
ancestors having eaten.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Because what our ancestors
ate were wild animals.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.130 align:middle line:90%
The closest thing would be game.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
And when people hunt deer--

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a hunter myself,
I don't believe in it--

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:84%
but I will tell you this, I will
respect someone who is a hunter

00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and kills a deer, particularly
if they do it cleanly, and eats

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.660 align:middle line:90%
everything from that animal.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going
to McDonald's.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And we've normalized that,
we don't think about it.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.800 align:middle line:84%
But there is an
animal behind that,

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and that animal lived
a life of torture,

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.420 align:middle line:90%
not the free life of the deer.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the hunter
is actually more

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.430 align:middle line:84%
ethical than the average
everyday consumer who's

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:26.060 align:middle line:84%
unconscious of the fact that the
flesh, the meat they're eating,

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:84%
came from an animal
whose life was

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.680 align:middle line:84%
a disgrace to the
human-animal bond,

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and that contains
substances like hormones,

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
like antibiotic
residues, and sometimes

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:46.210 align:middle line:84%
antibiotic-resistant bacteria
that then undermine our health.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And the difference in the
health implications and health

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:84%
consequences of modern meat and
dairy products compared to what

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:56.740 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors ate is enormous.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:00.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's painful to see.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And I respect those
who want to eat meat

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and are doing their best
to get grass-fed and truly

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:90%
pasture-raised animals.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Although even then,
they're breeds that

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:16.910 align:middle line:84%
have been bred for
maximum weight gain.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So I don't eat modern
meat at all, ever,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't in over 50 years.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 71, and I'm doing OK.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.028 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's also
something to be said--

00:36:32.028 --> 00:36:34.200 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to go
down this route--

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.890 align:middle line:84%
around the fact that we
domesticated these animals,

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and we're eating
domesticated animals.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like this-- we're becoming
domesticated as a species

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.500 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, from a nature-based
philosophy perspective.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:84%
The animals that we're
eating, and whose milk we're

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:57.380 align:middle line:84%
eating, as cheese, or yogurt,
or as milk, or ice cream

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.005 align:middle line:90%
have been domesticated.

00:37:00.005 --> 00:37:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Their entire lives
are controlled

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.930 align:middle line:84%
by an external
force, human beings,

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.130 align:middle line:84%
who has very little interest
in their well-being,

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.280 align:middle line:84%
or welfare, or
certainly happiness.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.210 align:middle line:90%
And they're subjugated.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.970 align:middle line:90%
They're imprisoned creatures.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we want our
spirits to be free,

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:84%
if we want to be lit
from within ourselves

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:84%
by our own life
force, I don't think

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:84%
it's helpful to
depend for our fuel

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.522 align:middle line:84%
on the flesh of animals whose
lives have been imprisoned,

00:37:36.522 --> 00:37:38.730 align:middle line:84%
whose lives have been
tortured, whose lives have been

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
subjugated, whose life
force is so squashed, so

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.535 align:middle line:84%
subordinated-- how they're
bred, how they're treated,

00:37:45.535 --> 00:37:46.335 align:middle line:90%
what they're fed.

00:37:46.335 --> 00:37:49.350 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I think the difference
between eating a wild animal

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and eating an animal that's
been bred and domesticated

00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:01.060 align:middle line:90%
and imprisoned is night and day.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's talk about--

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.862 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I really found
fascinating about your message

00:38:06.862 --> 00:38:08.320 align:middle line:84%
is how it's evolved
over the years.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And I saw you speak at the
Longevity Now conference about

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:84%
two or three years ago,
maybe-- maybe four years ago--

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and you made a comment about
how we're better off trying

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.710 align:middle line:84%
to make 80% of the
population eat more plants

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:23.020 align:middle line:90%
than 10% become vegan.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don' specifically
want to touch on that,

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.660 align:middle line:84%
but I do have a question
around, what are we to eat?

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.240 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, if
somebody doesn't want

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.158 align:middle line:84%
to be vegan, for instance,
if they don't have--

00:38:34.158 --> 00:38:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and I can understand
ethical reasons to be vegan,

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.150 align:middle line:90%
and I respect that deeply.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:84%
If someone doesn't want to be,
and they're just a lay person,

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and like, well, this
makes sense, this story,

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:90%
what do I eat then?

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what is the
most natural diet of a human.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Lots of plants, maybe you
could detail that a little bit,

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:56.680 align:middle line:84%
but also specifically if there
are some animal products--

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I know that you say, sometimes
wild fish or a few things

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:00.370 align:middle line:90%
like this--

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:04.480 align:middle line:84%
what would fit into the
framework based on your work?

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you wanted to reference
Healthy at 100, that would be,

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.820 align:middle line:90%
also, a great segue.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.840 align:middle line:90%


00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If someone wants to eat
animal products as part

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.660 align:middle line:84%
of their diet, the most ethical
and the healthiest is wild

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:84%
fish, particularly fish
that is low-mercury,

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that is high in
omega-3 fatty acids--

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:34.630 align:middle line:84%
wild salmon, sardines,
herring, mackerel.

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.080 align:middle line:84%
These are fish that are
low in heavy metals,

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.110 align:middle line:84%
low in contaminants, low
in pesticide residues,

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and are high in
the types of fats

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that our bodies need to thrive
and our brains need to thrive.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:49.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's the best.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
eating a wild fish,

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:90%
you're eating a wild animal.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.220 align:middle line:90%
You're eating an animal--

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
it may be living
in polluted waters.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately we have treated
the oceans and rivers and lakes

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.700 align:middle line:90%
like garbage dumps.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the waters of the world
are contaminated to an extent.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.913 align:middle line:84%
But there are fish that pick
up more of that and fish

00:40:09.913 --> 00:40:11.080 align:middle line:90%
that pick up less than that.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And the fish I
mentioned are the ones

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.320 align:middle line:90%
who pick up the least of it.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
wild Alaskan salmon

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.310 align:middle line:84%
is one of the lowest fish in
mercury that you could find.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Most forms of tuna, on the other
hand, are very high in mercury.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.217 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big issue.

00:40:28.217 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
eat fish, you don't

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.080 align:middle line:84%
want to take mercury
into your system.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.170 align:middle line:84%
What you want to eat,
though, is as many plants

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.930 align:middle line:84%
as possible, as many fruits, and
vegetables, and seeds, and nuts

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:41.140 align:middle line:90%
as you can.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people do well with
whole grains, others don't.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:48.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to listen to your
body on all of these things.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.685 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to be vegans
and eat no animal products.

00:40:50.685 --> 00:40:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to eat
some animal products.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.160 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of variation
here on what's a healthy diet.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.420 align:middle line:84%
But a healthy diet does not
include the processed junk

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.970 align:middle line:90%
foods that people eat today.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.200 align:middle line:90%
We've normalized that.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.492 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:41:05.492 --> 00:41:07.200 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't make
it healthy and that

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.367 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make it good for us.

00:41:08.367 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:84%
I grew up eating Sugar
Frosted Flakes for breakfast.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.640 align:middle line:90%
I know what that does.

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I would never
feed that to my kids

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
or want to see it fed to
kids, or adults either.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't eat any
factory-farmed products ever,

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't for over
50 years, because I'm

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:33.060 align:middle line:84%
a conscientious objector to
that way of treating animals.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:90%
It's so cruel.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And it produces
products that are

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.040 align:middle line:84%
harmful to us, that are so
different from the meats

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
grew up eating.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.200 align:middle line:84%
There's paleo
diets, where people

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:84%
want to eat as our ancestors
in pre-agricultural times did.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:90%
They didn't domesticate animals.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:84%
They didn't drink
the milk of an animal

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.295 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't control
the lives of animals.

00:42:00.295 --> 00:42:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:06.070 align:middle line:84%
When we eat modern meats
and dairy products--

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:90%
and eggs for that matter--

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:10.960 align:middle line:84%
we're consuming and we're
contributing our money

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to a system that has enormous
environmental implications--

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:84%
greenhouse gas emissions, water
pollution, soil degradation,

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:25.560 align:middle line:84%
so many, many serious
consequences to the ecosystems.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're eating products that
are damaging to our bodies,

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:33.370 align:middle line:84%
to our metabolism, to
our glucose regulation,

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:40.030 align:middle line:84%
to our hormonal balance, to
our cardiovascular health,

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:44.080 align:middle line:84%
to our respiratory health,
to our mental health.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're also eating
products that are really

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.950 align:middle line:90%
cruel to the animals involved.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:52.478 align:middle line:90%
And if we want to be healthy--

00:42:52.478 --> 00:42:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a marvelous thing
that the food choices that are

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.960 align:middle line:84%
healthiest for us personally,
that give us the most strength,

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.080 align:middle line:84%
the most vitality, the strongest
immune systems and therefore

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.900 align:middle line:84%
the least susceptibility
to pathogens and infectious

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
diseases, the strongest
respiratory system so we can

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:12.540 align:middle line:84%
breathe deeply with life, and
enjoy the beauty of simply

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.050 align:middle line:84%
breathing clean air--
hopefully we have clean air--

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and maybe then we're more
protective of our air,

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and more aware of it,
less likely to smoke,

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:24.760 align:middle line:84%
less likely to allow
polluters to prevail--

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.600 align:middle line:90%


00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:84%
the same food choices
that are so much healthier

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.240 align:middle line:84%
for us are also
kinder to the animals,

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.200 align:middle line:84%
don't involve treating animals
with egregious cruelty,

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and don't cause the
environmental distress

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and damage that modern
meat production is

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:90%
so good at producing.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:51.880 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that is a
win-win-win across the board.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I take it as a sign that this
is what we're meant to eat,

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.077 align:middle line:84%
this is how we're meant to
live so that we can thrive

00:43:59.077 --> 00:44:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and others can thrive,
so that we can thrive

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:03.760 align:middle line:84%
and we don't destroy the
world in the process.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
conquer the world,

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and turn resources into
revenue, and exploit and damage

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.550 align:middle line:84%
everything in order to prevail
over life, we can't just

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:16.420 align:middle line:84%
be with life, and be with
ourselves in a way where

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.360 align:middle line:84%
we risk we respect life,
and we live with reverence

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.120 align:middle line:84%
for the life force,
in us and in others,

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and we then protect the forests
instead of just see them

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:30.340 align:middle line:84%
as board feet to be sold,
and we protect the lifeforms

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that are part of the
biodiversity of the planet

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and part of the inextricably
interwoveness of our world.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.940 align:middle line:90%
We protect it.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.612 align:middle line:84%
And we protect it
cause we love it,

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and because it loves us back.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.620 align:middle line:90%
It feeds us.

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:44.677 align:middle line:90%
It's our source.

00:44:44.677 --> 00:44:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we don't want
to pollute the oceans

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:48.120 align:middle line:90%
and fill them with plastic.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Then we don't want to fill
our skies with toxic gases.

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Than we don't want to fill
the atmosphere with gases that

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.460 align:middle line:90%
are destabilizing our planet.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Then we want to
live with respect

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.190 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves and others
because it feels so good.

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, Joe, this
is so profound.

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, I've interviewed
people since 2007,

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:84%
and this is by far one
of the best, for sure.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:20.180 align:middle line:84%
You've crafted your message
for a number of years.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.905 align:middle line:84%
>> The world's
longest-lived cultures,

00:45:21.905 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:84%
the healthiest
and longest-lived,

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.920 align:middle line:84%
where there are the
most centenarians,

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.290 align:middle line:84%
people that live to 100,
and super-centenarians,

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:31.915 align:middle line:84%
people that live to
110, have been studied,

00:45:31.915 --> 00:45:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and we know who they are,
we know what they do.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.560 align:middle line:90%
And they vary a little bit.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.030 align:middle line:90%
They're all vegan-ish.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.010 align:middle line:84%
None of them are purely
vegan, but they all

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.170 align:middle line:90%
eat a lot of plants.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And none of them eat very
many animal products.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And none of them
eat any modern meat.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And none of them eat
any processed foods

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.110 align:middle line:84%
or packaged foods that we
see in our supermarkets that

00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:01.450 align:middle line:84%
are full of sugar, and
chemicals, and processing.

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And they also care
for each other.

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:07.360 align:middle line:84%
They live in a way where their
relationships with one another

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.370 align:middle line:90%
are their wealth.

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:84%
We think of wealth as what we
acquire, the things we own.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:84%
They think of wealth as who
they love and who loves them.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:84%
They think of wealth as their
character, their reputation

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.030 align:middle line:90%
in their communities.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And they care for what they
experience as their wealth.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.970 align:middle line:90%
They care for each other.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:33.040 align:middle line:84%
They care for themselves,
and their characters,

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and the kind of
people they become.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And they help others to
become the kind of people

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that they want in
their society--

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000 align:middle line:84%
honest people, hardworking
people, reliable people,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.930 align:middle line:84%
people of integrity, and
thoughtfulness, and depth,

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.270 align:middle line:90%
and creativity.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And they value the
person who can sing,

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:84%
they value the person who
can make beautiful things,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.550 align:middle line:84%
they value the person
who nurtures others,

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.670 align:middle line:84%
they value the people who
contribute to the well-being

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.340 align:middle line:90%
of their communities.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody amasses
personal stuff--

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.680 align:middle line:90%
what we would call wealth--

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.700 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of others,
they don't value that.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:19.590 align:middle line:84%
They see that that
ruptures the connectivity,

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.960 align:middle line:84%
the connective tissue
of the culture.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And so they look
askance on that,

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and they may even find
that to be shameful.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.630 align:middle line:84%
We, on the other hand,
will celebrate lifestyles

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.270 align:middle line:90%
of the rich and famous.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:36.600 align:middle line:90%
I find that a little crazy.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Because we have decided that
what makes a person rich

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is something that I view
as something that harms,

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:47.370 align:middle line:90%
in many cases.

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the person who
is rich in money

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and uses that money to help
others be well and help others

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:58.110 align:middle line:84%
live happy and joyful lives, and
safe lives, and secure lives,

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:59.820 align:middle line:90%
that I honor immensely.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.040 align:middle line:90%
We need more of that.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But all too often our
rich people don't do that.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And the cost to
their souls is great,

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and the cost to our society
is possibly even greater.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Fabulous, amazing.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:17.810 align:middle line:90%
You've said this so many times--

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.100 align:middle line:90%
we've really got it backwards.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And I would like if
we could finish here

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:26.960 align:middle line:84%
on how important it's
been for you, and maybe,

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.990 align:middle line:84%
in a sense of encouragement for
others, to move from their head

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.370 align:middle line:90%
to their heart.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And how if we follow
our heart, we're

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.610 align:middle line:84%
able to connect more deeply
with our spirit and our essence,

00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and potentially
uncover our gift--

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.870 align:middle line:84%
what are we here
to give, how can we

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:45.160 align:middle line:84%
turn our attention
from me, me, me to we?

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.083 align:middle line:84%
And if we can do that,
we can change our lives.

00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Because there will be a lot
of people in their 30s and 40s

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.620 align:middle line:84%
watching this who have spent
the first half of their life

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:59.060 align:middle line:84%
chasing money, fame, wealth,
notoriety, the big house,

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.970 align:middle line:90%
the kids in the private schools.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're unhappy,
and they're sick,

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:05.885 align:middle line:84%
and they need to
change direction,

00:49:05.885 --> 00:49:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they just need
to go and help build

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.810 align:middle line:90%
a school in a foreign country--

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:10.610 align:middle line:90%
maybe not that.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.340 align:middle line:84%
But in your final
sort of message

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:16.220 align:middle line:84%
here, John, in your
entire life experience,

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.993 align:middle line:84%
you made a distinction to move
from your head to your heart.

00:49:19.993 --> 00:49:21.410 align:middle line:84%
How important do
you think that is

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.760 align:middle line:84%
in terms of finding at least
happiness and peace in one's

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.440 align:middle line:84%
self, but also in terms
of how important that

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.570 align:middle line:84%
is for the world at this
stage, and if we all

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:32.180 align:middle line:84%
do that collectively,
how we could potentially

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.720 align:middle line:84%
reverse this mess we've
gotten ourselves into.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I think we all know the
world is in tremendous crisis

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.000 align:middle line:90%
and peril today.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think the way
we've defined success

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.620 align:middle line:90%
is part of that problem.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we are, as individuals,
rather than thinking

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.500 align:middle line:84%
about what gifts do we have
to develop, to cultivate,

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.290 align:middle line:84%
to grow inside ourselves,
and then to give,

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.160 align:middle line:84%
we're thinking about what we
can acquire, what we can take,

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.230 align:middle line:84%
rather than thinking about
what we have to give.

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And to be in reciprocity with
life, we give and receive.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And in order to
give and receive,

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:12.500 align:middle line:84%
you need to live with respect
for yourself and for the world,

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.970 align:middle line:90%
and for everyone else in it.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
billionaires and lead

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.550 align:middle line:84%
the world in homelessness as
well, that, to me, is a shame.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.030 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is
an embarrassment.

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:29.750 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is a
tremendous mistake

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:33.450 align:middle line:84%
that we've made in how
we define ourselves.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And if we can learn again
where our hearts are,

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:41.740 align:middle line:84%
find them, and let them teach
us, and show us, and guide us,

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.760 align:middle line:84%
and live according to what
is in our hearts and souls

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that we have come to this earth
to share, to give, to be known

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:55.580 align:middle line:84%
for, instead of just the
fame for its own sake,

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.510 align:middle line:84%
then we are playing
the part we are here

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:00.880 align:middle line:90%
to play in the healing.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And each of us
has a part to play

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:04.510 align:middle line:90%
in the healing that's needed.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:08.865 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you and I are each
one 7 billionth of humanity.

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can think
of it that way.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.770 align:middle line:84%
That's just a tiny,
tiny drop in the bucket.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.760 align:middle line:84%
But if there's enough drops,
it ceases to be a bucket.

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.740 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the tide
of history-turning.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It becomes something
that is unstoppable.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It becomes something that
is good, and wholesome,

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful, and
powerful beyond measure.

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
power that Gandhi

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.580 align:middle line:84%
called satyagraha, the
power of love force,

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:34.000 align:middle line:90%
caring, the power of Spirit.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And it is greater, when
we create it together,

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.100 align:middle line:84%
than the power of materialism,
and the power of the ego,

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.410 align:middle line:90%
and the power of separation.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's up to each
of us to find our calling,

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:51.330 align:middle line:84%
to find our spirit, find our
integrity, and to live it.

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, we're playing
the part in the greater healing

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:57.090 align:middle line:90%
that we're meant to play.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>> John Robbins, you're a
gentleman, you're a scholar,

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and you're here as
a force for good.

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a pleasure
speaking with you today.

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, James.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:06.920 align:middle line:90%
