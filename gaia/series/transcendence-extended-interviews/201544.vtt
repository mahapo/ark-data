00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.617 align:middle line:10%
It's James here
from Food Matters.

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And today, I'm excited to be
speaking with Jen Partridge.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.059 align:middle line:10%
She is the founder of
Dream Awake Tapping, author

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:10%
and tapping facilitator helping
you unlock blocked emotions

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.420 align:middle line:10%
and heal from trauma that could
be holding you back from living

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:10%
the life that you deserve.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Jen, how are you doing?

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm awesome.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to
be here with you.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.619 align:middle line:90%
True honor.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So I want to start
with your story.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Almost was there a catalyst
that sort of catapulted you

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
onto this journey of
discovering EFT, tapping?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.815 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's not something
in your recent history.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's something
that happened before you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:90%
were more cognizant of this.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:84%
How did you come
about uncovering

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.675 align:middle line:84%
what it was that sort of
set you on this journey?

00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think like many
of us, I think we all

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
have some level of trauma
stored inside of our system,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:90%
and some more than less.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So for myself, I grew up in
a really beautiful family,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
but I also had some sexual
trauma from an uncle,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
or a person in our circle
that I was told to call uncle.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And there was sexual
molestation that took place.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
obviously that's

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
overwhelming for a child, so you
block it out and you numb it,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:90%
and you forget about it.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that time, probably
about 15 years passed.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had certain
types of symptoms,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.710 align:middle line:84%
like fear of older
men and things

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
like that, but no
recollection of the memories.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
When I hit my late teens,
early 20s, I went into drugs.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.072 align:middle line:90%
Lot of escapism.

00:01:55.072 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Didn't want to be
with my thoughts,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be
with my emotions,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:90%
and really run my body down.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I was having anxiety attacks.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:84%
I was really overwhelmed
energetically,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and I needed to
figure myself out.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what was going on.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And it got to a peak time where
I started actually smashing

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:84%
the window above my
bed to try to escape

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night, thinking that there

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:90%
was an intruder coming in.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would have blood
running down my arms.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, what the hell
is going on in my subconscious?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And I tried Reiki, massage,
all sorts of energy healing,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:90%
yoga, meditation.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I just put myself
into everything

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out
what was going on.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
gave me peace, a lot

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.410 align:middle line:84%
of that settled the waters, but
the patterns kept coming back.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't actually
clearing the patterns,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
they were just
settling the waters.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered
tapping, and it just

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.440 align:middle line:84%
changed me massively in a
really short amount of time.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.318 align:middle line:84%
I started working on
the core piece, which

00:03:04.318 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:84%
was like why am I getting up
in the middle of the night

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and smashing a window,
and all the trauma

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and fear that's
running through my body

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:90%
when that's taking place.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And as I started to
use tapping on it,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:90%
the memories started to come.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was the very first
time I actually got my memory

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:90%
back around what happened.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And probably for
about six months,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
I did continual work on that,
and pulled out so many layers.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
memories kept unfolding,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:84%
and more and more love was
brought to those memories.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of the fear that
was trapped in my system

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
started to dissolve.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And those reactions that I would
have in the middle of the night

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
stopped, and I became
more peaceful inside.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, wow, this
is a method that has totally

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
helped me, totally changed
me, and it's up to me

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
to pay this forward, because
I really owe my life to it.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've used
it on pretty much every area

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the tool that
I go to because it's

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
so quick for me and it
transforms things really fast.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
That waking up and attacking
a window is unique.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I know.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had it
happen to me once.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I won't share that--

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, wow.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> --now because I
want to stay with you,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:84%
but when you said that, I
was like, oh my goodness,

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:90%
that's crazy.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.340 align:middle line:90%
Not the same thing, but.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:90%
How old were you?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Sort of what age were you?

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.290 align:middle line:90%
What was growing up like?

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Who was this uncle guy?

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the scenarios
around your childhood

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.840 align:middle line:84%
that you've started
to understand more

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:84%
about that were
causing this trauma?

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.000 align:middle line:90%
What was the sort of era?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.400 align:middle line:90%
You know, the '80s, early '80s ?

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was the '80s.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for diving in
deep with me on this one.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:90%
It was in the '80s.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And my parents would hang
out with this other couple.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And my dad and this man
would drink a lot of beer,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and there were like just
kind of rowdy nights.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what I can
remember from it.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that there
was a level of unawareness

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
from my parents that
it was happening,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and that he would come in in
the middle of whatever they

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:84%
were up to, and I was
always put in their bed.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So we would go to
my uncle's house.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
They would all, like, have
some type of party or whatever,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:90%
and I would be in the back bed.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And he would come in.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And the very first memory
that actually came up for me

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:84%
was kind of the bookend
of when it stopped.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And I remember, like--

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I must have been
five years old, and I

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
remember standing
up and being like,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:90%
you're not coming in anymore.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like
wanting to, like, stop it,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and really feeling like I've
got to stand up for myself,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.870 align:middle line:84%
because before that, it
had happened so many times,

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and then I would
fall back asleep.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
it was happening

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:90%
even before I could even talk.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And there were times when I
even tried to tell my auntie,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
or who I was calling
auntie, about it.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that
someone had called him--

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:90%
and mind my language-- a wanker.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
that was a bad word.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.047 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, maybe that's
my way in to tell them

00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:90%
that something's going on.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.755 align:middle line:84%
Because I couldn't
even understand what

00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:84%
it was, but I knew
that it wasn't good.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, uncle
so-and-so is a wanker.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And like, they
totally reacted at me.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:90%
Like, they shut me down.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It was the last time
that I ever was like, oh,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
let me try to
communicate about this.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.760 align:middle line:84%
That was wrong to try
to communicate about it.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So I never spoke
to anyone about it,

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and it just got really
bottled down more and more.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And I actually only
opened up to my family

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
about it probably like 7 to
10 years ago, when I first

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:90%
started to uncover it.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was a hard process to go
through to even recognize like,

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:90%
oh, did this really happen?

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Like, I haven't remembered
this, and now, all of a sudden--

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
but I could feel it being
released in my body.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And the intense emotion
that was coming out

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:84%
of me when I was healing, I was
like, you can't make this up.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
happens to a lot of people who

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
have blocked out trauma,
especially sexual abuse,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:84%
because I work with
a lot of women,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
even men who have had
sexual abuse earlier on,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:90%
and they've numbed it out.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, they doubt that--
they think they're making it

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:90%
up, or how could this be true.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But if there's emotion
running through your system

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
while you're processing it, you
know there's something there.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We're thankfully living in an
era where the vulnerability is

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:90%
being rejoiced--

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> --around coming
forward on these topics.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've seen people in all
different industries and walks

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.950 align:middle line:84%
of life start to
share their stories.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's created a
landscape for that discussion.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> How have you seen the
conversation evolve since you

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
sort of-- you know,
you touched on it,

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
since you first started
talking about it,

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:90%
come to be accepted more?

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And also, how have
you found that process

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:90%
in your own family?

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
Because that would
be the toughest,

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:84%
like, environment
to talk about this.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:90%
I think it's hard--

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:84%
for anyone that hasn't
experienced that type of abuse,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.617 align:middle line:84%
it's hard for them
to really understand

00:08:42.617 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:90%
what you're going through.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can communicate it
to them and they can go through

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
their series of emotions, shock
or feeling guilty that they

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.910 align:middle line:84%
weren't aware, or different
things can come up,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
but I still feel, if they
haven't experienced it,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard for
them to understand,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
because even for me now,
I've cleared out like some

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
of the major boulders, but
there's like little fine-tuning

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:90%
pieces that still--

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.213 align:middle line:84%
like, I'm running a fine-tooth
comb through this process now,

00:09:15.213 --> 00:09:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and there's still little pieces
that occasionally come up.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not completely cleared.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And some people think, oh, it's
like you do a process around it

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and you're done, but
there's so many strands.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I feel
like talking to my family

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:84%
or talking to people that
haven't experienced it,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
they don't understand how all
the layers interfere and affect

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
your psychology
through your life.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What have you discovered
personally around how this type

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
of trauma for you or other
types of trauma have impacted

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
your life, your
function as a human,

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:90%
your capability to do things?

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.020 align:middle line:84%
What are the biggest
things that you've noticed?

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think at the start
it was harder to trust men.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And definitely being
around older men,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
as well, like, I would feel
uncomfortable in my body just

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:90%
being around an older man.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
why I had that.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.490 align:middle line:84%
I've cleared all
of that now, but I

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:84%
think at the start there was
a lot of kind of like ugh.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, you attract
weird men because you're

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.970 align:middle line:84%
seeing through a lens
of I can't trust men,

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
so you start to
attract weird men.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I moved to America and
I was in the Hollywood scene,

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I attracted all of that type
of masculine energy towards me

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, wanted to do
the whole casting couch thing.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So that was a part
of me healing it

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
because that brought all
of that stuff up again.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually a
gift that you attract

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.170 align:middle line:84%
people similar to your trauma
because then it's pulling out

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:90%
the trauma to be loved.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
So that definitely happened.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And then in terms of,
like, getting over,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:84%
like, feeling more
trust in my body,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
when I did one of the really
big taps, my hips, like,

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
literally reshaped
themselves, because I noticed

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually, like, kind
of trying to protect myself

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:84%
with one of my legs,
so like curving it over

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
into the middle, and my
hips were permanently, like,

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.040 align:middle line:90%
kind of a little bit like that.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I tapped, my
hips went back into place

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:84%
because the cellular memory
and the protection that

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
was happening on a subconscious
level cleared out, as well.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
So physically, my body
started to change.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
The way I related to
myself and my body

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and how I honored my body and
what I stood for in my body

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.780 align:middle line:90%
all shifted, as well.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And no longer am I
afraid of an older man

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
or what they could do
to me, which was just

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:90%
the younger child speaking.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:84%
It's I'm comfortable
in myself now,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and no one can take advantage
of me because I'm in control.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So that has been a
journey to that place.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure the journey
uncovered a lot of things

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that you tried or
you experimented with

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:90%
or you explored.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And by the sounds of
it, you eventually

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:90%
sort of settled on tapping.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:12:12.802 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some
of the modalities,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:84%
what's some of the
exploration you did?

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Who's some of the people's
work that you studied?

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
What did you read?

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:90%
What did you uncover?

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
What did you learn about
trauma in that young period

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:84%
of-- that developmental
period of life?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't start
uncovering my trauma

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:84%
until I was probably
19 years old,

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
after being on a massive
level of escapism on drugs.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, not only did
I have to clear the trauma,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.150 align:middle line:84%
but I had to clear
all of the drug abuse

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:90%
that was on top of the trauma.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
So I went into, like,
so many modalities

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to take care of
my physical body,

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:90%
such as juicing and cleansing.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously, when you
do that, more emotions come up.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So I discovered meditation,
I discovered yoga,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I became a Reiki practitioner,
I started energy healing.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:84%
I pretty much read every
book that I could find.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Deepak Chopra was a
big influence on me,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
just in terms of like
realigning my focus,

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.490 align:middle line:84%
because often when you're
overtaken by emotion,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
that can control everything
that's happening around you.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And just recognizing
that that core process

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:84%
of realigning your mind when
you're in an emotional state

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:84%
can really help sharpen
and direct your life.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Eckhart Tolle that was
an amazing one for me,

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:90%
"The Power of Now."

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
methods allowed me

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:84%
to drop in and
recognize who I was,

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.070 align:middle line:84%
and to let go of the story
that was controlling me.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
lot of health issues

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that are caused by
drugs, that's affecting

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
your psychology, that's
making you feel sick,

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:90%
there's like detox going on.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy for the
mind to identify with that

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:90%
and say, oh, that's who I am.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And so these teachers, earlier
on I was reading their books,

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
but now I've had interviews
with Deepak Chopra

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and introduced him on
stage, and these people

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:90%
are now in my community.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wow, how
did I get to this place

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.970 align:middle line:84%
where now I'm sharing a
stage with these people?

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And these are the people
that I admire the most,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and these are the people that
helped me out of my trauma.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm super grateful
for that, and I

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
feel like it's going to be
a continual journey in terms

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:90%
of my discovery, as well.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Like, EFT is the place
that I've landed,

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and I have pretty much
created my own version of EFT

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:84%
because of all the
things I studied.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.340 align:middle line:84%
I did the Tony
Robbins University,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and so I apply a lot of NLP into
my tapping practice, as well.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Also, I really got into somatic
work, movement in the body,

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
recognizing where trauma
is held in the body.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my teachings, they
bring in physical expression.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:84%
We do dance at the
end of my workshops

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:90%
to really bring in celebration.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
the tapping, it's

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:84%
kind of a whole array of
things, which I've now packaged

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.788 align:middle line:84%
as Dream Awake
Tapping, which I feel

00:15:15.788 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
is really important because,
when you're tapping,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:84%
you're clearing out the trauma,
you're breathing through it,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:84%
but one of the most
important things I've seen

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:84%
is, like, really inviting
in celebration and joy,

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:32.110 align:middle line:84%
because that is such a beautiful
alchemy to combat any pain

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:90%
that you're having, as well.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So you want to process
the pain, but then you

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.400 align:middle line:84%
want to reprogram it with
love and joy and beauty

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:90%
and forgiveness.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:90%
I did see the Deepak interview.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Jelly.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:47.906 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:48.706 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:15:48.706 --> 00:15:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.770 align:middle line:84%
In your drug sort
of days, you said

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:84%
that you did that for
escapism, but there

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:03.730 align:middle line:84%
is some interesting
research around how--

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
even there is some
research, Gabor Mate,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.565 align:middle line:84%
I think, on how heroin
users are really

00:16:09.565 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:84%
trying to replace
love that they didn't

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:12.398 align:middle line:90%
receive when they were older.

00:16:12.398 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that, on
top of the sexual abuse,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:19.320 align:middle line:84%
was there conditional love
or love that was lacking,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
or were you doing it
for other reasons?

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Have you--

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.287 align:middle line:84%
>> --thought deeper
on that topic?

00:16:24.287 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I have thought so
much about this topic,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:84%
because now I'm a really
deep believer in working with

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
different substances as
a medicine to support

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
your evolution, to support
your inward looking,

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and working with, whether
it be psychedelics,

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:90%
even MDMA and things like that.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm not so into MDMA
because of the chemical

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
feeling that I get, but
I have done medicine work

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
with some of these things
that people might call drugs,

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and actually evolved
a lot of myself

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
because it creates a
container to really look deep.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that
earlier time in my life,

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:84%
yes, any escapism is
seeking to find love,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
it's seeking to have
that connection,

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
it's seeking to feel
held and embraced,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and so it does give you that.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
beautiful part about it.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But in that time in my life,
I was getting those feelings,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
but I also wasn't doing
the inner work with them.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
I was combining with
alcohol and smoking,

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and my mindset wasn't
about looking within.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
It was about partying and
not thinking about it.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Whereas now-- and you know,
I took a real long break,

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
probably about 10 years from,
like, those earlier crazy years

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:84%
to actually say, wow, maybe this
could actually be a medicine.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And people that
came into my circle

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.060 align:middle line:84%
were viewing it in
that sacred way,

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:84%
in a container where you
could actually go deep

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and you can do inner
work on yourself.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And some of that work has
been the most profound work,

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
in combination with the
tapping, to really look within

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and change some of
the patterns or habits

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
or heal of things
that are causing you

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.835 align:middle line:90%
trauma from the inside.

00:18:13.835 --> 00:18:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you done ayahuasca?

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm, yeah.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I've used ayahuasca three
times, and each time

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:90%
has been completely different.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:84%
The common thread
between it every time

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.300 align:middle line:84%
was, for myself, in my
own experience of it--

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and this is just my
experience, everyone

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:84%
will say something
different, but for me, I

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:84%
became deeply in touch with
the all-seeing dimension.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, in my logo,
I have an eye, because I've

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
realized through the
process of that medicine

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that we can try to
hide things, which

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.820 align:middle line:84%
is what the subconscious
is doing, but ultimately,

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
everything is watching
you all the time.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
revealed, everything

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
is being seen all the time,
and you actually can't really

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:90%
hide it.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.650 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe,
all of creation

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.540 align:middle line:84%
is watching you with this,
like, open eye of seeing.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And we come into
these physical bodies

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and we think, oh, I've got to
hide this from everyone else.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, you're
actually not really hiding.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:90%
You think you are.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's been an
amazing medicine for me

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's allowed me
to be more transparent

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and to actually be able to look
at pain more, because I realize

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:90%
it's important to look.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of
the greatest lessons

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:84%
from ayahuasca, to actually
really open your eyes

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.557 align:middle line:84%
and look at what's there
so that it can transmute,

00:19:39.557 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:84%
because when you're not
looking at it, when you're

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:84%
closing your eyes to it or
pretending it's not there,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
it's still there, yet
it's creating chaos

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:90%
underneath the surface for you.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
So that was one thing
that's really come through

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:54.600 align:middle line:90%
in ayahuasca ceremony.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I could talk about
so many things.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
My very first
ayahuasca showed me

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:84%
my life mission, why
I was here, like,

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.315 align:middle line:84%
opened up all the codes for
me, really activated me in,

00:20:06.315 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
like, this is what you're
here to do on the planet.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was, like, a
huge movement forward.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I've had
experiences with ayahuasca

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
where I am, like, throwing up
24/7, my whole body convulsing.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Lost complete
control of my body.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
They had to, like, drag
me out of the room.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.040 align:middle line:84%
My whole limbs were, like,
dragging along the ground.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And that was like total
surrender of ego and absorption

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:90%
with the whole.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it was so hard
because I was being shown

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:90%
all the pain of the world.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Like, the pain in Africa, like--
it was just like everything

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:84%
was pain, pain, pain,
and look at the pain,

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:84%
see the pain, which is
a big part of my work,

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:90%
is to look at pain.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it was like a
jumpstart, like are you really

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:90%
ready to do this type of work?

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's show you pain, then.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was a fast
track for my evolution

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:90%
to look at so much pain.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And every time I saw
something painful, blegh,

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:90%
I would, like, throw up again.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really, really hard
session, that particular one,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:84%
but I left it feeling like I was
so much more receptive to hold

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.230 align:middle line:84%
space for pain, and
for other people's pain

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and for my own pain.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was the second
one or the third one?

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:90%
>> That was my last one.

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Last one, OK, cool.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And since--

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> So no going--

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --that one--

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:30.915 align:middle line:90%
>> --back after that.

00:21:30.915 --> 00:21:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> --I was like, all right,
I'm gonna take a break.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm good.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm good for now.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.495 align:middle line:84%
In your exploration,
you found tapping.

00:21:39.495 --> 00:21:41.610 align:middle line:84%
EFT, emotional
freedom technique.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:84%
How did you find it, and how
did you find it work for you?

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So I originally met my teacher,
Sonya Sophia, at Burning Man,

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:90%
out of all places.

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And Burning Man,
if anyone's been,

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
then they know it's a
total creative expression

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:90%
of the human spirit.

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And I love that place
for that reason.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And she would run
these amazing groups,

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
like hundreds of people to
wear these beautiful big wings.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And like, she would dress
up in her angel avatar.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was staying at
the same camp as her,

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and I did one of
her tapping sessions

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and it really changed me.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was
like, wow, I'm in media,

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:84%
so I actually interviewed her
for a radio show that I had.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:31.680 align:middle line:90%
And we really hit it off.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Several months later, she asked
me to be her right-hand girl

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and help her produce all
of her video content.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I traveled with her,
did her teacher trainings,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and was really her right-hand
girl for three years,

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and just soaked up
all of the training.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, did a
lot of healing myself, as well.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful for
her and all the work

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that she brought to
me, as well, and how

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that gets to be rippled
out through my work now.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And in that time, I was also
studying other modalities,

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:01.650 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I did the Tony
Robbins, and I started

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:84%
to bring NLP into
the practice, music

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.372 align:middle line:84%
into the practice,
movement into the practice.

00:23:08.372 --> 00:23:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I really spun
out and created my own thing,

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.100 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So for the person
listening, what is EFT?

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:84%
How does it work,
and how was that

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.095 align:middle line:90%
so foundational in your process?

00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So emotional freedom technique,
some people call it tapping,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:84%
it's a blend of
modern psychology

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:90%
and Chinese medicine.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So modern psychology,
if you've ever

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.960 align:middle line:84%
been to a counselor
or a therapist,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about your
issues, your challenges.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And then while
you're doing that,

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:90%
often you get triggered, right?

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Your whole body.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.335 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're talking
about your trauma,

00:23:42.335 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:90%
so you feel very triggered.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful
thing about this

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.740 align:middle line:84%
is we then start bringing
in the physical body,

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.290 align:middle line:84%
we start clearing it out
through the meridians.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So in Chinese medicine,
if you've ever

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.420 align:middle line:84%
done acupuncture or
acupressure, there's

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
specific points where
they place the needles.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And these are
basically the points

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.240 align:middle line:84%
where there can be high
voltages of stagnation.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you place a
needle in those points,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:84%
it clears out that
stagnation point

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and allows prana or
life force to move

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:84%
through that
particular energy line.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
doing in tapping,

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.250 align:middle line:84%
while we're talking about
our issues out loud,

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
we start tapping on
some of these core

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:84%
points while breathing
and circulating that prana

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
through those points, as well.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you move into the
reprogramming of the brain.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So they've shown
that when you start

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
to draw upon those memories,
you're opening up files

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:90%
in your brain, as well.

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And those files might
have emotions and memories

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.000 align:middle line:90%
and thought forms and beliefs.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:90%
And you start going into those.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And as you open it up, if
it was not healed in love,

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:84%
then it's likely that
there's fear there.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And the fear is basically
just shooting back and forth

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:84%
between a synapse
and another synapse.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
it's glued together

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.490 align:middle line:90%
by these protein bonds.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is something might

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:02.015 align:middle line:84%
happen in your life that looks
like that earlier trauma,

00:25:02.015 --> 00:25:04.140 align:middle line:84%
or someone might enter that
looks like that earlier

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:08.610 align:middle line:84%
person that hurt you, and
then that pathway fires up

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and you go back to
that old pattern again,

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that old belief,
that old emotion.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And that happens over
and over and over again.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:90%
We repeat cycles.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We attract similar
people into our lives.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And they've shown in
tapping, when you go in

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and you open that up in your
mind and you start bringing it

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
love, empathy, and
forgiveness, the protein

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:84%
bonds or the scaffolding
that's holding it all in place

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
starts to melt away and
the synapse opens out.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
rewrite your beliefs,

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:84%
you can rewire your
system of thought.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:84%
We have so many neurons in our
brain, more neurons than stars

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:84%
in the Milky Way galaxy,
and we use like 10% of them.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually start
rewriting, rerouting,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and choosing new
habits that are now

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:84%
informed by love and
forgiveness and empathy,

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and we can set up a new system
inside of our brain, as well.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's really powerful because
you're working on the brain,

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:84%
you're working on
the physical body,

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.342 align:middle line:84%
you're clearing out
the charge, and then

00:26:05.342 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing in the spiritual
component, which is really

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.720 align:middle line:90%
that love and compassion.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Love, compassion,
forgiveness.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Huge components in
emotional healing.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:84%
You did that through
tapping, by the sounds of it.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
In your particular case,
did you forgive this person?

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Did you do it in person?

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Did you do it remote?

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.440 align:middle line:90%
Are they still alive?

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:84%
What was the actual sort
of process around that

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:90%
specifically for you?

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Or was it something you just
did alone in your bedroom,

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.260 align:middle line:84%
like, look, I'm done,
I've sort of cleared this.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, like tell me
a little bit about that.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So he actually died
of testicular cancer,

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:90%
out of all things.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And that happened way
before I ever recall.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.710 align:middle line:84%
So I must have been
like 12 years old,

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't even know
I had trauma back then.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
figured it out, there

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
was no person to go
to process it with.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of OK
with that, actually,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:84%
because it wasn't something that
I needed him to get closure on.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I needed to get
closure in myself.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:90%
And I've done many taps on it.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, it took a
while to really come

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:84%
to a place of forgiveness
and letting go.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that occurred

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:84%
to me in a tapping
session that I did on it

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:26.920 align:middle line:84%
was that, in my
instance, I actually

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:84%
felt like he probably had
some type of sexual abuse,

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:84%
as well, because abusers
usually do more abuse, right?

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you were abused,
you usually abuse others,

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
until someone breaks
out of that cycle.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that a
child being molested

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.780 align:middle line:84%
represents complete
sexual purity.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Like totally untainted,
totally clean.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like,
in some way, he was

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.930 align:middle line:84%
seeking his own sexual purity
through touching another child,

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.240 align:middle line:90%
because a child represents that.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was a really
interesting level of awareness

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that came in when I did
that tapping session.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that
allowed me to really let

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:90%
it go and understand.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, like, the trauma
needs to be released, as well.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So the trauma and
the forgiveness

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.390 align:middle line:84%
can sometimes be two
different things,

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.430 align:middle line:84%
because you could
forgive someone,

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
but your body's still
holding protection.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to understand,
and like wow, OK, he clearly

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.110 align:middle line:84%
was messed up, and someone
clearly messed him up, right?

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Which is what happens.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm able to let that go.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of the healing
was like, OK, I'm safe now.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.240 align:middle line:84%
And for a while, even after
I was smashing the window,

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:84%
after that settled
down, I was still

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.150 align:middle line:84%
having nightmares of
someone breaking in.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't as intense.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that I would start doing

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:84%
was if I heard a noise,
especially if I was home

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:84%
by myself, this voice
would come out of me,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.700 align:middle line:90%
and I'd be like, who's there?

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Like, a really deep,
masculine voice

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.410 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night would come out,

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like wake
myself up with it.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And one night, like, my partner
was watching TV or something

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.690 align:middle line:84%
in the other room, and I had one
of those little episodes where

00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:84%
this deep voice came out
because I heard a noise.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:33.360 align:middle line:90%
And he started to laugh.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:90%
You know, because it was funny.

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, your girlfriend,
like this little fairy

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.300 align:middle line:84%
is making this
really deep voice.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what
it was connected to.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
it like triggered

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:84%
all this memory of feeling
like I had to be big in order

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:90%
to protect myself.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And that allowed all of this
emotion to come out of me,

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
because I realized that I
didn't need to do that anymore,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and that I was safe.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, I was able
to clear even that pattern

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.090 align:middle line:84%
because I know
that I'm safe now,

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.130 align:middle line:90%
and that he's not coming back.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, the body is
like, what if he comes back?

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:90%
I've got to be prepared.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.050 align:middle line:90%
I've got to be ready.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
I named my brand Dream

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Awake because it represents
such depths to me because I

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.140 align:middle line:84%
would be asleep dreaming,
and then I wake up.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.380 align:middle line:90%
And those words are like--

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.005 align:middle line:84%
they're part of why
I'm here on the planet.

00:30:29.005 --> 00:30:30.130 align:middle line:90%
They're part of my service.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:31.255 align:middle line:90%
They're part of my mission.

00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:32.830 align:middle line:90%
They mean so much to me.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I connected,
wow, it's like dreaming

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and then awakening
and, like, feeling

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.630 align:middle line:84%
like I gotta protect myself,
so that's how my company really

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.400 align:middle line:90%
came into fruition.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's about, like,
awakening your dreams

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:90%
and being awake in the dreams.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So those words have
really rung true for me.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Profound realization.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Almost this-- I've heard this
term, hurt people hurt people.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.050 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's where
you got to with this,

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and that enabled you to sort of
release him from his actions.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.280 align:middle line:84%
That must have
been huge for you.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.507 align:middle line:84%
And I think to start with,
it was like, am I forgiving?

00:31:12.507 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if I'm forgiving,
because you might forgive

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.580 align:middle line:84%
a part of it, and
then something else

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:84%
might come up, like
real anger towards him,

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and you thought that
you'd fully let it go.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And that has been a
process of recognizing

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that forgiveness doesn't
necessarily just happen

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.330 align:middle line:90%
in one moment.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
There might be many
strands that come up.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And you might think you're
completely done with it,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.920 align:middle line:84%
but then there's
another strand that

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:90%
just hasn't been examined yet.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I've had an opportunity
to move through many phases

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:90%
of that forgiveness.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And right now, I
feel really complete,

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and I understand, and that's
why I'm in the work that I'm in.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.958 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it was a process.

00:31:50.958 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So you work with
other people now.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:90%
That's really beautiful.

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.470 align:middle line:84%
You're extending your
passion, your mission

00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:84%
to help sort of sever the ties
of this sort of continuation

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
of pain and suffering or
subconscious conditioning

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:90%
to then potentially hurt others.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:13.410 align:middle line:84%
What are the sort of typical
emotional traumas that you get

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:84%
presented with with people
that you're working with?

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.360 align:middle line:84%
What do you find is
most common, and what

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
do you find tapping
helps most effectively?

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.760 align:middle line:90%
It's across the gamut.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So tapping works on
absolutely anything.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with everything
from really intense cases

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:44.130 align:middle line:84%
of kidnapping and rape to
money issues, relationship

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:84%
challenges, personal
power, self-worth,

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:51.000 align:middle line:90%
communication breakdowns.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:84%
You can really use tapping
on absolutely anything.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it
works on everything

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:84%
is because emotion
is in everything.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I've realized
as a practitioner,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.650 align:middle line:84%
you usually attract
people into your life

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.140 align:middle line:84%
that you also need
work on, as well.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And tapping is
beautiful because when

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm tapping for someone else,
I'm showing them how to do it,

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:84%
but I'm doing it
on myself, as well.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
teachers that I train,

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.440 align:middle line:84%
they have this
method which we call

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:84%
mirror tapping, so
anyone you are helping,

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.562 align:middle line:90%
you're also helping yourself.

00:33:23.562 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the most
powerful things of tapping

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.020 align:middle line:84%
because, usually, when
you're a massage therapist

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.480 align:middle line:84%
or you're a healer, sometimes
you might feel drained.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.030 align:middle line:84%
But when you're tapping
and you're a coach,

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:84%
you're actually supporting that
person through it, and anything

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.490 align:middle line:84%
that you have unresolved in
your subconscious around it,

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.710 align:middle line:84%
you're tapping
yourself, too, and it's,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:84%
in a subconscious way, revealing
and clearing your stuff,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, there's
been countless stories

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.490 align:middle line:90%
of people going through things.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I had a person that
had been to Africa--

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:58.535 align:middle line:84%
like, this is one of the really
intense ones-- and you know,

00:33:58.535 --> 00:33:59.910 align:middle line:84%
you hear about
things that happen

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.880 align:middle line:84%
when people go on these
trips to Africa to help out

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:90%
and being kidnapped.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And this lady had had
a bag put over her head

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:90%
and taken to a place.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know, each step of those
memories are really intense.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And those memories
can stick with you

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:23.070 align:middle line:84%
unless you're able to
look at it frame by frame.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:84%
When it went over my
head, how did that feel?

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's clear that piece.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.770 align:middle line:84%
When I couldn't breathe,
how did that feel?

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:30.918 align:middle line:90%
Let's clear that piece.

00:34:30.918 --> 00:34:33.210 align:middle line:84%
When it was really dark and
I'd been there a long time,

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.010 align:middle line:90%
how'd that feel?

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So you go through
frame by frame.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not just like, oh,
big blanket healing.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It's getting into the
details, and each detail,

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:90%
how did that feel?

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's clear that out.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Next detail, how did that feel?

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's clear that out.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:84%
Until you've gone through
the whole movie in your mind,

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and you can go back and
forth and it's no longer

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.170 align:middle line:90%
triggering you.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:58.777 align:middle line:84%
>> So how does tapping
untrigger painful emotions?

00:34:58.777 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Like, what is the process?

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.360 align:middle line:84%
You've explained it, but let's
just go through it again.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we talk through
an example of somebody

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:09.760 align:middle line:84%
you helped, maybe
another example,

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.940 align:middle line:90%
or how you helped yourself.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's just go through a little
bit of this process again.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So let me drop into an
example to share with you.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So I have a friend, and
they've come to me for support.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
topical piece.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So they were having trouble
within their relationship

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and they were going through a
lot of change in their life,

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.867 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
feeling like they

00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:39.080 align:middle line:84%
were getting their needs
met from their partner.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, they were
done with trying to push them,

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and they were really
angry and overwhelmed,

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.210 align:middle line:90%
and they wanted to move house.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And there was all this stuff
going on as a result of it.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And we came in and we start
doing the tapping process.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'll have him massage
the specific points,

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.450 align:middle line:84%
talk about what's on the
surface to start with,

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.070 align:middle line:90%
so how do you feel.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:90%
We process the top of it.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So this has been
happening, and this

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is making me feel really
angry and sad and overwhelmed.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.320 align:middle line:90%
And you clear that.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've
cleared the top of it,

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.008 align:middle line:84%
then you start going
a little bit deeper,

00:36:13.008 --> 00:36:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and you ask the person,
what's your earliest

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:20.600 align:middle line:84%
memory of feeling a similar
way around this type of topic?

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And then what would happen
is, in this instance,

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.660 align:middle line:84%
and in pretty much all
instances, a memory occurs.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it has something to
do with mom or dad or something

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.760 align:middle line:90%
happened at a younger age.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And in this one, father
issues came through.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Father wasn't taking care
of me, mom wasn't around.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And we got to look at
some of those pieces,

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:84%
because that's
where it got set up.

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we processed that
memory in a similar way, where

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.300 align:middle line:84%
we look at it frame by
frame what was happening.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, he wasn't there anymore,
or she wasn't there anymore,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and that made me feel
lost, scared, alone,

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:90%
afraid for my life.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And let's clear that.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And we go through a process of
breathing, talking about it,

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing forgiveness
and love and compassion to it.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And then we even do techniques
where we bring in the higher

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.770 align:middle line:84%
self to come in and give
the younger self a hug,

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:19.510 align:middle line:84%
or we invite ourselves to
see our parents' higher

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.990 align:middle line:90%
self coming in.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.240 align:middle line:84%
We do techniques where
we imagine ourselves

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.330 align:middle line:84%
holding onto that resistance
for the rest of our life

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:90%
and never letting it go.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And we go all over
the map to really look

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.230 align:middle line:84%
at the psychology for
why we're holding on

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and why we can't let it go.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And then we bring all of
that love so, finally, you

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.680 align:middle line:90%
can release it.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
release it, then

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:45.780 align:middle line:84%
you start moving into the
process where you start saying,

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:90%
what do I want to feel?

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:90%
What do I want in my life?

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.720 align:middle line:90%
How do I want this to look?

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.320 align:middle line:90%
What am I claiming for myself?

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.300 align:middle line:90%
What am I worthy of?

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.310 align:middle line:90%
What do I deserve?

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And as you ask yourself
those questions,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and now you've got the
spaciousness because you've

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.750 align:middle line:84%
cleared out all
the trauma, you've

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.800 align:middle line:84%
got the spaciousness in your
being to fully receive it,

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.750 align:middle line:84%
and that's able to then set up
into your new way of perceiving

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:10.550 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And then it happens
naturally in your life,

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.770 align:middle line:84%
versus telling yourself
all these affirmations

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.060 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, but
not actually clearing

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:18.860 align:middle line:90%
out the trauma.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.450 align:middle line:84%
So then you've got
affirmations on top of trauma.

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So if you clear out the trauma,
you sink in the affirmations,

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.800 align:middle line:84%
they go in deep, and then they
start to grow and flourish

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.750 align:middle line:90%
in your being.

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool analogy.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.018 align:middle line:90%
That's really awesome.

00:38:34.018 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask a little
bit more around this

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:36.810 align:middle line:84%
because I think
it's interesting.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think people
hold onto emotions?

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's a
conscious decision,

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.360 align:middle line:84%
or do you think it's
something they're not

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.700 align:middle line:84%
aware of until they start
tapping and figuring this out?

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I would say, through working
with all of my clients,

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:53.450 align:middle line:84%
the most prominent
reason is protection.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We think, by holding onto them,
we're protecting ourselves.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.110 align:middle line:84%
If I hold onto this, I'll
remember to look out for that.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.230 align:middle line:84%
There's also reasons of
trying to prove a point.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.410 align:middle line:84%
If I hold onto this, they'll
see that it's an issue for me,

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:90%
and therefore they'll change.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
strategy that's going

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.410 align:middle line:84%
on in the subconscious for
why you're holding onto it,

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and you think, in a
subconscious level,

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.620 align:middle line:90%
that it's actually helping you.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Which feels logical,
but ultimately it's not.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So what are the challenges
of holding onto that?

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a limiting belief system
around clearing emotions

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.700 align:middle line:90%
there, right?

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and then because
you haven't let it go,

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:32.600 align:middle line:90%
you're still--

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't
processed it, really,

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.900 align:middle line:84%
because if you did
process it, you

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.490 align:middle line:84%
would realize that it's
not really helping you,

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:90%
and you would let it go.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So because it's unprocessed
and you're holding onto it,

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:43.220 align:middle line:84%
you're actually
attracting people

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.100 align:middle line:84%
into your life that look
like that so that you

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:90%
can exorcise it on them.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And you'll keep doing that
until you actually look and say,

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's time to
review this pattern.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not helping me.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.525 align:middle line:90%
It's damaging my relationships.

00:39:57.525 --> 00:39:58.400 align:middle line:90%
It's hurting my life.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It's hurting my physical body.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you usually
have that wakeup call.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it takes
a lot to actually take

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:08.360 align:middle line:84%
a look at what
you're holding onto,

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.000 align:middle line:84%
because earlier on, you know,
it's not bothering you so much.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.920 align:middle line:84%
You might be a
little bit defensive.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.200 align:middle line:90%
But over time, it builds.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And if it's still unexamined,
it will then, like,

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.840 align:middle line:84%
build into something
massive that

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.990 align:middle line:84%
is causing disease in the
body or true breakdown

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:90%
in your relationships.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost like we start
the healing process when it gets

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.030 align:middle line:90%
bad enough, in a way.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Like, we can deal with it--
it's like eating bad food.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Like--

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>> --you can get away with it--

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:35.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> --when you're younger,
and then after a while,

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.920 align:middle line:84%
you're like, this isn't
going to work anymore.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.844 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:38.844 --> 00:40:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, just tapping into
that a little bit further,

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:84%
there's lots of discussions
around being parents by split

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.630 align:middle line:84%
personality, narcissistic
personality disorder,

00:40:53.630 --> 00:41:02.140 align:middle line:84%
these type of sort of
strangely egotistical love,

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.960 align:middle line:84%
attention-seeking
personalities in our life,

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and then oftentimes, one
of two things will happen.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's grown up
in an environment where

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:11.920 align:middle line:84%
love is being
withheld or there's

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.530 align:middle line:84%
a really dominant personality
that sort of causes

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.080 align:middle line:84%
them to sort of behave
and fall into line,

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.610 align:middle line:90%
then they can either--

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:21.010 align:middle line:84%
they tend to either attract
a lot of those same people

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.077 align:middle line:90%
and situations into their lives.

00:41:23.077 --> 00:41:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see it happen,
and you're like hang on,

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:26.660 align:middle line:84%
you're sort of with the
person that you sort of

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:27.580 align:middle line:90%
despised forever.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
falls into this trap,

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lack of
awareness, and maybe a lack

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.400 align:middle line:84%
of being able to helicopter
out and see that.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And then people get
worried around them.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
these crazy patterns

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.707 align:middle line:90%
that happen in relationships.

00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:42.540 align:middle line:84%
You've sort of brought
this up a little bit.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.580 align:middle line:84%
How have you experienced
this to be true or not true?

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, people only
know what they know.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:53.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're born into a
family that doesn't love,

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.750 align:middle line:84%
then that's what
you think love is.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And so you look for that
because it's comfortable

00:41:58.610 --> 00:41:59.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's what you know.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.140 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know that
a whole new level of love

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.770 align:middle line:90%
is available out there.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And so you attract people
based on what you expect

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and what you grew up
with, a lot of the time.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It's often very hard
for someone that

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:18.040 align:middle line:84%
grew up with punishment or abuse
to even recognize that there's

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.810 align:middle line:90%
something better out there.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.490 align:middle line:84%
They may, like, on
the surface know,

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:25.100 align:middle line:84%
but on a subconscious
level, as a child,

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.880 align:middle line:84%
especially between the
ages of zero and seven,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
your reality, you're

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:31.870 align:middle line:84%
looking at your
parents, the people that

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:34.810 align:middle line:90%
taught you as, like, gospel.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And that sets out the pathways
to this is what reality is,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is what you should
expect, and this is normal.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And later on, you still
have those patterns,

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.400 align:middle line:90%
so you're looking for that.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.990 align:middle line:90%
You attract that.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And then things
get really hectic,

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and you might say, wow, this
isn't really helping me,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.450 align:middle line:84%
but I keep attracting these
types of people into my life.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And then hopefully, you have
some type of support around you

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
that can help guide you to
understand that there's so much

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:84%
more out there, so much
more available, so much more

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.060 align:middle line:84%
love and caringness that
can come into your life,

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:13.010 align:middle line:84%
even though you've
never experienced it.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never
experienced it,

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.330 align:middle line:90%
like, how do you know it exists?

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's the process of kind
of stepping over into that.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Well-explained.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.068 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:26.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like you don't know what
you don't know, in a way,

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and then there's this
awareness garnering experience

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.610 align:middle line:84%
or a pain point
that might cause you

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:35.580 align:middle line:90%
to seek deeper help with that.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.415 align:middle line:84%
Can we go through sort of a
generic process of tapping?

00:43:39.415 --> 00:43:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You touched on it
before, but I'd

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:84%
like a little bit more
detail, if possible--

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --because--

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely, yeah.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.337 align:middle line:84%
>> --it's an
interesting strategy,

00:43:44.337 --> 00:43:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and I've been taught
tapping by certain people,

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Nick Ordner and Alex and some
other people that have been

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:53.810 align:middle line:84%
taught it and showed me, and
it's useful for cravings,

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.370 align:middle line:84%
emotional issues, all
this sort of stuff.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:57.290 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I can take you through a
little process if you'd like.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That'd be great.

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:01.865 align:middle line:84%
And could it be almost
generic in nature?

00:44:01.865 --> 00:44:02.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:02.665 --> 00:44:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do that.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> That'd be really cool.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And how much time would
you like me to spend on that?

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>> You decide.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Three minutes, five
minutes, whatever it might be.

00:44:10.778 --> 00:44:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It'd be great to do
a tapping script, so.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Love that.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's just
start, and if you're

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:20.690 align:middle line:84%
watching at home, just massage
underneath the collarbone here.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take
you through some points.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And you'll just follow
the points with me.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And don't worry if you
tap on the wrong point.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.070 align:middle line:84%
You really can't mess up,
because there's points

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:32.180 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
piece is to really feel

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:36.560 align:middle line:90%
what's coming up.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.188 align:middle line:84%
Not to intellectualize it,
to let yourself really feel.

00:44:40.188 --> 00:44:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And then just follow the point.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:42.563 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need to do.

00:44:42.563 --> 00:44:43.670 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So tune into any challenge
that you're having right

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.050 align:middle line:90%
now in your life.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Something that's bothering you,
someone who's triggered you,

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.460 align:middle line:84%
something that's really
hurting right now.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And give yourself permission
just to tune into that.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
a call and response.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So I will share some
thoughts, and then you'll

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.010 align:middle line:90%
just repeat them.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And if the word isn't
completely accurate,

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.100 align:middle line:84%
just change the word
to match what you feel.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.310 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what you
feel, then give my word a try

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's likely
that you're numb.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:15.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:19.010 align:middle line:84%
So repeating after
me, even though I've

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:25.550 align:middle line:84%
been struggling here, tapping
the center of the chest,

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and I just want
you to say out loud

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:90%
how you've been struggling.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.110 align:middle line:84%
What's been going
on in your world?

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Why are you struggling?

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Just go on a little
rant about it.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Talk about it out loud.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.595 align:middle line:90%
I've been struggling by.

00:45:38.595 --> 00:45:44.239 align:middle line:90%


00:45:44.239 --> 00:45:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And then tap between the brows.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And then just tune
into that struggle.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Tune into how it feels to have
that struggle, that pain that's

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:57.060 align:middle line:84%
coming up, all of that
hurt that's there.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And what's the most intense
emotion that comes up for you?

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:00.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it fear?

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Is it anger?

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Is it sadness?

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Is it grief?

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Is it worry?

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.000 align:middle line:90%
What is the emotion?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.550 align:middle line:90%
It feels like.

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.775 align:middle line:90%
And just name the emotion.

00:46:09.775 --> 00:46:13.470 align:middle line:90%


00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.820 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the temples.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:90%
It feels like.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Say the emotion again.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:22.340 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.000 align:middle line:90%
And tapping the cheeks.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.210 align:middle line:90%
And I feel really stuck here.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:27.465 align:middle line:90%
And you say those words.

00:46:27.465 --> 00:46:30.670 align:middle line:90%


00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:33.328 align:middle line:84%
And just feel into any
stuckness that's right there.

00:46:33.328 --> 00:46:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to feel what
it feels like in your body.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.410 align:middle line:90%
What's the texture of it?

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:41.980 align:middle line:84%
What's the color of
it, if it had a color?

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Where is it in your body?

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Where are you
holding it right now?

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.390 align:middle line:90%
And then just lean into it.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Really feel it right now.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.270 align:middle line:90%
Lean into it.

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Get uncomfortable with it
just for a moment with me.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And then take a big deep
breath and release a big sigh.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.060 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHING]

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And then tap
underneath your nose.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:11.175 align:middle line:90%
I love and deeply accept myself.

00:47:11.175 --> 00:47:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Exactly as I am.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Tapping underneath the lips.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Even though I've been
really struggling here.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:28.810 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.910 align:middle line:84%
It's possible I'm
worthy of love.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the center of the chest.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.075 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:47:38.075 --> 00:47:38.875 align:middle line:90%
I can heal this.

00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:42.850 align:middle line:90%


00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Take a big deep breath.

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:47.604 align:middle line:90%
Release a big sigh.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the front of the ribs.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.475 align:middle line:84%
I love and deeply
forgive myself.

00:47:55.475 --> 00:47:59.550 align:middle line:90%


00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.320 align:middle line:90%
For how hard this has been.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the side of the ribs.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:84%
It's possible I'm still
a good human being.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:16.610 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the side of the wrist.

00:48:16.610 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:84%
It's possible I'm
still worthy of love.

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:21.550 align:middle line:90%


00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Take another big deep breath.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.820 align:middle line:90%

Tapping the side of
the thumb here where

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.630 align:middle line:90%
the nail juts out the most.

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:36.250 align:middle line:90%
I am worthy of love.

Tapping the next finger.

I am worthy of

Tapping the middle finger.

I'm worthy of taking
care of myself here.

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the struggle
that you've been having.

Tune into when it
was most intense.

giving yourself a great big hug

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:07.330 align:middle line:90%
of love right now.

All of that love,
all of that empathy,

all of that forgiveness
that you deserve.

You've been trying so
hard to figure it out.

Tapping the side of the hand.

what that is right now.

I guess to sort of
finish up while we're

on this high, what is the
big mission behind your work?

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important for
people to clear emotions?

00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Why is it more important
now than ever before,

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and what is your
real call to arms

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.890 align:middle line:84%
for people in the human race
with the work that you do?

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, every single
human being feels emotions.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And in the current
lineage that we're all in,

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.850 align:middle line:84%
we haven't all been taught
how to process how emotions.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, there's a lot
of war, there's a lot of greed,

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.380 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of power
struggle, there's a lot of pain

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.000 align:middle line:90%
still in the system.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And that overflows
into our nations,

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and then into the
world as a whole.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And I really know
within my being

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.890 align:middle line:84%
if we, as individuals,
can come into deep harmony

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:36.730 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, the
power and the magnificence

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that we can create as a
global culture is phenomenal.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:44.050 align:middle line:90%
No challenge is too big.

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:45.940 align:middle line:90%
We can do absolutely anything.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.975 align:middle line:84%
Because emotions get
in the way of business,

00:55:48.975 --> 00:55:51.010 align:middle line:84%
they get in the way
of relationships,

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:53.260 align:middle line:84%
they get in the
way of everything.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And my mission is
to really deliver

00:55:56.350 --> 00:56:00.640 align:middle line:84%
this globally on a large
scale to millions of people,

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and have that ripple
out, and to teach coaches

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and other trainers so that they
can go into their communities

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and they can spread it, and
then they can spread it.

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is such a powerful
tool because it's non-dogmatic.

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:15.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not a religion.

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have a specific
spiritual practice.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can do it because
we all relate to emotion.

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it can
really touch so many people

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.820 align:middle line:84%
for that reason,
because it doesn't

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.680 align:middle line:90%
have so much stigma on it.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just let's feel what we're
feeling and bring ourselves

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.060 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And we all love to do
that when we do it.

00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like we can
really touch the globe

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.310 align:middle line:84%
with this message, and
together, as a humanity,

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:43.780 align:middle line:90%
we can transform.

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And everything that
we do as a humanity

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:49.760 align:middle line:84%
will transform as
a result of it.
