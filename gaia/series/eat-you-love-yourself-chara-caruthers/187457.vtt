00:00:12.047 --> 00:00:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARA CARUTHERS: Welcome back.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's time for us to
transition into spring.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm really excited,
because in this episode,

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be sharing with
you the qualities of spring

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and how they show
up in your mind

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and in your body
this time of year.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm also going to
be talking to you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:84%
about my mantra for
wellness in the springtime

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and how you can apply that
to not only your self-care,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:90%
but also your eating.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, but
certainly not least,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.883 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be sharing
some of my favorite recipes

00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:90%
for this time of year.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:84%
They've got the
qualities that are

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.550 align:middle line:84%
going to keep you balanced and
blissful through the season

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:90%
and beyond.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So what are the
qualities of springtime?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time we get
to the end of winter,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
we're all starting to
feel a little bit heavy.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And so heaviness is definitely
a defining quality of spring.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:84%
It's also still a
little bit cold.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
We haven't shifted quite
yet into the warmer weather.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.763 align:middle line:84%
And so springtime is
actually quite cool as well.

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And then lastly, of
course, springtime's

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:84%
the time when it does
a lot of raining.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we get a lot of wetness
not only outside of us,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.617 align:middle line:90%
but also inside of us.

00:01:16.617 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the sorts of
imbalances that we

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.367 align:middle line:84%
see, beyond those things
that I talked to you about,

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:84%
are things that are going
to be related to heaviness

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:90%
and coldness and also wetness.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:90%
So what do we see?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:90%
We see depression.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we see a little
bit of weight gain.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:90%
We've got congestion.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And of course, spring is
famous as our allergy season.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And so my Ayurvedic mantra
is really, really simple.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's energizing, drying,
stimulating, expression.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:90%
So energizing.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.907 align:middle line:84%
It's time to get
out of the house.

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:90%
It's time to move around.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's also time
to think about how we

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:90%
can energize our minds as well.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And taking foods that have
some lovely spices in them,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:84%
those actually help with
this energizing feeling.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:90%
Drying.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I mentioned before, one
of the qualities of springtime

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:90%
is wetness.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we are going
to want to make sure

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
that we're offsetting
some of that wetness,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
particularly in our foods, by
taking foods that kind of help

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:84%
to dry things like
congestion up or things

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:90%
like blockages in the body.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:90%
Stimulating.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, stimulating kind of
goes along with energizing,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.805 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
We've been sitting
around in the house,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.877 align:middle line:84%
hanging out in the cold weather
throughout the winter season,

00:02:26.877 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and it can be a time
when we can start

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:90%
to feel a little bit stuck.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And so stimulating ourselves
by engaging in activities that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
are stimulating, whether
that's for the mind

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
or whether that's for the body,
things like hiking or dancing.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Those things are
terrific for starting

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.963 align:middle line:84%
to break up some
of the heaviness

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
that we've been feeling
through the wintertime

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and leave us feeling more like
ourselves in the springtime.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:90%
And then lastly, expression.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
By the time we get
to spring, we've

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.960 align:middle line:84%
spent a lot of time kind of
turning inward and looking

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:90%
inward.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
to you before,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we can start to
feel a little bit stuck.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And so springtime
is a wonderful time

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.310 align:middle line:84%
to let loose, shake it up,
and be really expressive.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I often recommend
that the springtime

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
is a really good time for people
to start singing, especially

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
if they're feeling anything
like depression or anxiety

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.445 align:middle line:90%
or particularly stuck.

00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:84%
What kind of foods
are we going to want

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.695 align:middle line:84%
to be taking in the
springtime in order

00:03:23.695 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:90%
to support this mantra?

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got three
particular tastes

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're working
with-- bitter, pungent,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and astringent.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
each of them in turn.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Bitter.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So bitter is going to be
things like leafy greens.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of our fresh herbs
have got bitterness in them.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And bitterness is going
to add a antiseptic

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and a clarifying quality to
the mind and in the body.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.933 align:middle line:84%
So it's a great time
to start incorporating

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
some of those leafy greens,
especially as we start to move

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:90%
into the warmer weather.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Pungent.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So pungent, as you can
imagine, is heating.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
It's adding nice, lovely
spices or things like ginger

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.730 align:middle line:90%
to the mix.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And pungent adds an energizing
and a stimulating quality.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.618 align:middle line:90%
And then lastly, astringent.

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So astringent is something you
might not be as familiar with,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
but it has a lovely
drying and toning quality.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And astringent can
actually be found

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
in foods like apples
and pears, and also

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:84%
in some of the leafy greens
as well, like spinach.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So how are we going to
incorporate some of these foods

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
into our diet?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've brought along
some of my favorite recipes

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:84%
for this time of year to
show you how simple and easy

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
it can be to create
foods quickly

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:90%
that are balancing for spring.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to share with
you one of my favorite smoothie

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.097 align:middle line:84%
recipes for this
time of the year.

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is not your
typical smoothie.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
We've sort of taken it and
we've turned it on its head.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
We're including things
like leafy greens.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So we've got some
lovely spinach in there.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's also got some bitter
and some astringent qualities.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:90%
We've got some apple.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned before, apple
has a beautiful astringency

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that's really good,
but it's not too sweet.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:90%
And also, pear.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But what we've done is we've
added a little bit of warming

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:90%
spices--

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.683 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of cinnamon,
a little bit of ginger--

00:05:05.683 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and we've warmed
the whole thing up

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
by cooking the fruit
and the veggies down,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll turn
it into a smoothie

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can enjoy on one of
the cooler mornings or perhaps

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
even afternoons of
this spring season.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So there you have it-- a
yummy warm green smoothie

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.562 align:middle line:84%
that's packed full of nutrients,
a little bit of warmth,

00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of bitterness,
and a little bit of astringency

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to help keep you happy,
balanced, and nourished

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:90%
this time of year.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.072 align:middle line:84%
So next, it's time to
dive into our spices.

00:05:36.072 --> 00:05:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
going to be doing

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
is putting together a
special spice mix for spring.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
we call a churna.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And churna, basically, is just
a mixture of powdered herbs.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, traditionally,
Ayurvedic medicines

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.347 align:middle line:84%
or prescription preparations
are given in this form.

00:05:53.347 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
going to do is we're

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
going to work on a churna
for the spring season.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you a
couple of my favorite ways

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:90%
to use it.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:90%
So what do we have?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.635 align:middle line:84%
What goes into our spring
season churna or masala?

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:90%
All righty.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.827 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got just
a couple of spices.

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So you can see here,
I've got my spice tin.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the spices
in here that we're

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:84%
going to be adding to our
spring churna are turmeric.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So turmeric's got that beautiful
anti-inflammatory qualities.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%
It's got antioxidant qualities.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It's got some pain-relieving
qualities as well.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Turmeric is a beautiful spice.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
It's actually quite good
for all times of year.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.885 align:middle line:84%
But we want to make
sure that we get it

00:06:32.885 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:90%
into our springtime churna.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:84%
The next is we're going to be
adding some coriander seeds.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.750 align:middle line:90%
So coriander is a digestive.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And because of the cold and
heavy qualities of spring,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
things kind of slow down
sometimes in the digestion.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And so having
something that is going

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.332 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate our digestion is
going to be really helpful.

00:06:52.332 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to be adding
a little bit of ginger.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:90%
This is a dry ginger.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So dry ginger, as
opposed to wet ginger,

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:84%
actually has more
heating or more hot

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
qualities as opposed
to more warm qualities

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.343 align:middle line:84%
that the wet ginger or the
fresh ginger is going to have.

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.010 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we're
going to be adding

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:84%
to this springtime churna is
one of my favorites, cinnamon,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.550 align:middle line:84%
and yet another pungent
and stimulating spice,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.900 align:middle line:90%
black pepper.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.023 align:middle line:84%
As you can imagine,
this tastes amazing.

00:07:18.023 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
These are really
wonderful spices.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:90%
They work really well.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And they complement each other
not just in their qualities,

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.040 align:middle line:84%
but also in the way
that they taste.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And so how can we use these?

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've brought along
a couple of my favorites

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
for really highlighting
these spices.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And the first is a
really simple snack--

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:90%
popcorn.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So popcorn has
qualities that are

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.900 align:middle line:90%
light and dry and also warm.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
perfect snack, right?

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect snack
for springtime.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.182 align:middle line:84%
And all we're going
to do is just top

00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:50.890 align:middle line:84%
it with a little bit
of our spice mix.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Mix that up a little
bit and enjoy.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.005 align:middle line:84%
OK, and our last dish for
spring could not be easier.

00:08:00.005 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It consists of
only just a couple

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.708 align:middle line:84%
of ingredients along
with our spice mix.

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
putting into this one?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, this one is
a sheet pan dinner.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:90%
And I've used some tofu.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.210 align:middle line:90%
This is nice firm tofu.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And all I've done is I've
broken the tofu up into just

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:90%
some pieces by hand.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And then the other is
one of my favorites,

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite vegetables,
a really nice one that

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.330 align:middle line:84%
has those bitter and
astringent qualities as well,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's just some long beans,
some green beans, or runner

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:90%
beans sometimes they're called.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So all we're going to do is I
break up those pieces of tofu.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:84%
And I throw a couple of
handfuls of beans into a bowl.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put a little
bit of ghee on top of that,

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and then throw in a couple
of teaspoons of my spice mix,

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.510 align:middle line:84%
mix it around, spread it out
on a sheet pan, and go ahead

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.590 align:middle line:90%
and roast it.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:90%
And then it's ready to serve.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:90%
