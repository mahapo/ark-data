00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello and welcome to "Eat
Like you Love Yourself--

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.313 align:middle line:84%
a Guide to Discovering your
Unique Formula for Thriving."

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And today, I want
to introduce you

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient living and
healing science of Ayurveda.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.528 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps you've already
heard of Ayurveda.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've heard
about it before.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've even started to
incorporate some of its wisdom

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.140 align:middle line:84%
into your living
and your eating.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Even if you haven't
heard anything about it,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
you're going to gain
heaps of knowledge

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly personal
power through understanding

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:90%
some of its key principles.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And so what is Ayurveda?

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, Ayurveda is a
5,000-year-old approach

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
to living and healing that
rests on some simple ideas.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:84%
The first of which
being that who we are

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
is a relationship between
what's going on outside of us

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.720 align:middle line:90%
and what goes on inside of us.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
We often forget that we
are just another part

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of the natural world
that surrounds us.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
that our environments

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:84%
have a huge influence on
our health and wellness,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:84%
right down to the ways
that we think and make

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:84%
our choices for everything from
foods to self-care to careers.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And what's also important,
particularly if you're

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:84%
committed to thriving, is
understanding that who we are

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is more than just
a series of parts.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The mind and body are
inextricably connected.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in the mind goes
on in the body and vise versa.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And so our approach to
achieving everything

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:84%
from healthy, glowing skin
and hair to a healthy weight

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
to a cool and calm attitude
is going to be impacted by

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and what we think as much as
by what we eat and how we move.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And so Ayurveda
gives us guidance

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
for how to prevent illness
and disease before it even

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:84%
gets started by teaching us
simple, practical ways to live

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.233 align:middle line:90%
like we love ourselves.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And that starts
with understanding

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.840 align:middle line:90%
three additional ideas.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Number one, each of
us is 100% unique.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So Ayurveda isn't interested
or focused on one-size-fits-all

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:90%
approaches to anything.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
It understands that you are
an entirely different person

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:90%
to anyone around you.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Your environment's different.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:90%
Your history's different.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Your family's different.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
The things that you experience
and do on a daily basis

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:90%
are completely different.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.292 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
that illness and wellness

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
is going to be
achieved differently

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
for every single
person on the planet.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you can accept
your individuality,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.590 align:middle line:84%
then you can begin to
embrace your unique gifts

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
and your challenges.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can also
start to understand

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that the responsibility
for discovering

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:84%
your own unique formula for
thriving is entirely yours.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So number two is that we change
as the world around us changes.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the only thing
that's constant is change.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So the weather, the seasons,
the circumstances and situations

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that we find and
put ourselves in,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
these all have a subtle
and not-so-subtle impact

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:90%
on who we are and who we can be.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got to tune
in to the impacts in order

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to make the healthiest changes
for ourselves in the moment.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And so as you change
throughout the year

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.603 align:middle line:84%
and throughout your
life, your needs change.

00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got
to pay attention

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
to what that change looks
like and what it feels like.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
be willing to keep

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
asking the question, how
can I eat and move and act

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
in a way that serves who I am
and who I need to be today?

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.845 align:middle line:84%
And last, but
certainly not least,

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
is that Ayurveda wants you
to understand that wellness

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:90%
is a beautiful conversation.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we
come into contact with

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
has a potential to support
or sabotage your health

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.810 align:middle line:90%
and wellness.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the art of
living powerfully

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.089 align:middle line:84%
is the art of developing this
give and take with your world,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
of cultivating an experience
of living that feels more

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:90%
like a dance than a tug of war.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And so finding a
balance that feels

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.830 align:middle line:84%
like your own unique
experience of wellness

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
is a matter of
avoiding the extremes

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and mastering the art
of counterbalance.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's countering frustration
with ease, countering confusion

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:84%
with curiosity, impatience
with understanding,

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and more practically, as you'll
see, it's using qualities

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
like lateness to
counter heaviness,

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.840 align:middle line:84%
hot to counter cold and
vise versa, and moisture,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
lubrication, and juiciness to
counter the common experience

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:90%
of drying out as we age.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:90%
