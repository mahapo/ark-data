This smoothie turns the typical smoothie on its head. We use fruit and leafy greens with astringent qualities to dry up congestion, and warming spices to counteract the wet heaviness of spring.  And then we warm it! The experience of this yummy warm concoction may just change your smoothie game for good.\nIngredients\n(use organic ingredients where possible)\n\n1 medium apple \n1 small pear \n¼  tsp cinnamon \n½  tsp grated fresh ginger  \n⅛ tsp nutmeg  \n3 large handfuls baby spinach \n\nDirections\n\nPlace apple, pear, and spices in a medium sized saucepan. \nAdd 3 tablespoons of water, cover, and cook until fruit is fork tender.  \nPour the contents into a blender.  \nAdd spinach, blend on low for 20 seconds, then high for another 20 seconds or until completely  blended.  \n\nSpring Spice Mix (Churna) \nChurna is a Sanskrit word that means a mixture of powdered herbs. Traditionally ayurvedic herbal formulations are given out in this powdered form. Creating spice mixes is something of a seasonal tradition in parts of India where families (most often the women) will choose, toast, and grind the spices into a churna that can be used all season to ward off imbalances.    \nIngredients\n(use organic ingredients where possible)\n\n2 tbsp ground coriander \n1 tbsp ground ginger  \n1 tbsp ground turmeric   \n1 tsp ground cinnamon  \n½ tsp black pepper   \n\nDirections\n\nAdd spices to small bowl. Mix to combine.  \nStore in an airtight container for up to three months.\n\nSavory Spiced Popcorn\nPopcorn is one of our favorite snacks. It's naturally warm, light and dry, so I've added a stimulating kick to it with spices like curry powder, paprika, and black pepper to turn the spring season  balancing power up a notch. These warming spices will awaken your mind, body, and spirit, and set you free! \nIngredients\n(use organic ingredients where possible)\n\n⅓ cup popcorn kernels  \n2 tsp ghee (optional, no ghee needed for air popped)  \n2 tsp spring spice mix   \n\nDirections\n\nPrepare popcorn. Top with a sprinkling of seasonal churna! \nIf using a stove top, put popcorn kernels and ghee in a heavy bottomed pot on medium heat. \nCover tightly and listen for the sound of popping. Once the popping starts, shuffle the pot over the heat to keep the  popcorn from sticking to the bottom. \nOnce the popping stops, remove the popcorn immediately into a bowl and sprinkle spice mix through, tossing to coat.    \nIf using an air popper, pop popcorn per popper instructions. Top with melted ghee (optional) and sprinkle spice mix through, tossing to coat.  \n\nSheet Pan Spicy Tofu and Beans Serves: 3-4\nQuick meals are a godsend to the soul. Especially when you can make them with the spirit of gratitude and the same amount of love and intention that you would an elaborate feast. This one is as simple as they come, and tasty too! It satisfies veggies and protein requirement with just enough flavor and umph to make it quite likely a mainstay in your household like it has become in ours. The flavors of this one - bitter, spicy, dry and a little sweet - are a perfect answer to the wet, cold or muggy heaviness of spring.     \nIngredients\n(use organic ingredients where possible)\n\n400g tofu \n200g green beans \n1 tbsp olive oil or ghee  \nJuice of one lemon  \n1 tsp smoked paprika  \n1 tsp cumin powder  \n1 tsp coriander powder  \nHandful coriander leaves (cilantro) \n1 tsp salt  \nBlack pepper\n\nDirections\n\nLine a baking sheet with baking paper and set aside.  \nPlace the tofu pieces in a large mixing bowl and add spices, oil/ghee and lemon juice. \nStir or mix with your hands to coat everything and allow to sit covered for up to 1 hour.  \nPreheat oven to 350°F (180 °C). \nUsing tongs or a fork, remove all the tofu pieces from the bowl and place them on the baking sheet, leaving the residue of lemon juice and spices behind.  \nBake the tofu for about 35 mins or until it starts to bubble and slightly brown.   \nAdd the green beans to the marinade bowl and mix to coat them with the juice and spices. \nRemove the tofu tray from the oven and add the green beans and any remaining juice and spice mix to the tray. \nPut the entire tray (tofu and beans) back into the oven and bake for a further 15 to 20 mins or until the beans are fork tender.\n","teaser":"In this episode, Chara shares with us a simple mantra for wellness in spring that can be applied to your self-care and eating!","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/0c74ad17-2f5a-4c78-8326-ef52e6cba3f1/186499_ELYLY_e4_Eating-for-Balance-in-Late-Winter_16x9.jpg"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/24172732-bc06-4c8c-87d1-da93e21a8c93/186499_ELYLY_e4_Eating-for-Balance-in-Late-Winter_16x9_clean.jpg","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/24172732-bc06-4c8c-87d1-da93e21a8c93/186499_ELYLY_e4_Eating-for-Balance-in-Late-Winter_16x9_clean.jpg","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/24172732-bc06-4c8c-87d1-da93e21a8c93/186499_ELYLY_e4_Eating-for-Balance-in-Late-Winter_16x9_clean.jpg"}},{"seriesId":184260,"seriesTitle":"Eat Like You Love Yourself with Chara Caruthers","seriesPath":"series/eat-you-love-yourself-chara-caruthers","seriesVoteDownCount":19,"seriesVoteUpCount":220,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/628291bd-11bc-470b-b41f-543d1704909c/default_cover.png","created":"2019-05-17","episode":5,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/d7ff24e6-363e-4a7c-ac1b-6c8c4d5a197e/gaia-thumbnail-default.jpg","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/b5c53647-c3d2-4310-a55a-4cfc1a109cb8/186500_ELYLY_e5_Eating-for-Balance-in-Summer_hero-clean.jpg","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/eating-balance-summer","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/628291bd-11bc-470b-b41f-543d1704909c/default_cover.png","published":true,"season":1,"title":"Eating for Balance in Summer","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"voteDownCount":4,"voteUpCount":50,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":6,"seasonCount":1,"preview":null,"feature":{"duration":640,"mediaId":187458,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":187458,"isFree":false},"id":186500,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"In this episode, Chara introduces us to:\n\nThe qualities of the summer season and the ways that these qualities are mirrored in the mind and body. \nA wellness mantra for the summer season that can be applied to your diet, self-care, and interactions to keep you cool, calm, and centered.\n\n\nRoasted Fruit with Coconut Yogurt & Seeds \nServes: 2 - 4\nBreakfast doesn't get easier than fruit!
