00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:11.592 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.592 --> 00:00:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, there.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.600 align:middle line:84%
It's getting hot
in here, and that

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:84%
must mean that summer
season is around the corner.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And so in this
episode, we're going

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
characteristics of summer

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you
are in the world

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and how those same
characteristics are mirrored

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.920 align:middle line:84%
in our mind and
body this season.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:84%
You better believe I've
also got a balancing

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:84%
mantra for summer season that
I'm going to share with you.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I've brought along
a few mind body balancing

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
summer recipes to cool, calm,
and tantalize your taste buds.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And so what are the
qualities of summer?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we can all agree
that summer is the hottest

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.570 align:middle line:84%
time of the year, and
so that quality of heat

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
is something we really
need to be aware of

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:90%
and pay attention to.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It also brings a
level of intensity

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and a sharpness that can
show up in our bodies

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and in our interactions
with each other.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Summer is one of the
most active times

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of the year in the natural
world and also with us,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.427 align:middle line:84%
so there's this
energy of movement.

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
a lightness to summer,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
which we can feel and which
actually shows up in the fact

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that we get the most
hours of actual daylight

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.030 align:middle line:90%
during this season.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what kind of imbalances
are we seeing during the summer

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:90%
season?

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the heat--
as the temperatures

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:90%
start to rise, so do tempers.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And so things like
anger, and aggravation,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and even impatience are on the
rise during the summer season.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Other heat-related
issues that we

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:84%
can experience during
this time of year

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:90%
are things like inflammation.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Skin issues can start to
rear their ugly heads--

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.710 align:middle line:84%
so things like
acne, skin rashes,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and, of course,
bites and stings.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And we're also seeing
things like infection,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:90%
diarrhea, reflux, and acidity.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And so my Ayurvedic balancing
mantra for summertime

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.130 align:middle line:90%
is simple.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
It's cooling, calming,
moderation, and flow.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So cooling is going
to be a quality

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that, as you would
imagine, is going

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:90%
to offset some of that heat.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Calming is a way of stepping
back from some of the intensity

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:84%
that we may be feeling
or that we may be

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:90%
drawn into this time of year.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Moderation, well,
that's a way of letting

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:90%
go of any draw towards excess--

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.820 align:middle line:90%
anything excessive.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:90%
And then there's flow.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard the
term, go with the flow.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, flow is about
letting go of intensity

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and this my way or
the highway thinking

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and finding a way of infusing
a sense of ease in our approach

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:90%
to life and living.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And what kinds of
foods are we going

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.837 align:middle line:84%
to want to be choosing
this time of year

00:02:39.837 --> 00:02:43.375 align:middle line:84%
in order to support
us living this mantra?

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, the simple
taste that we're

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:84%
going to be looking
for in the summertime

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:84%
are sweet, bitter,
and astringent.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So the sweet taste
we're going to find

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.240 align:middle line:84%
in some of these
gorgeous fruits that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.490 align:middle line:90%
are around this time of year--

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:90%
stone fruits, melons, grapes.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
We'll also find a sweet
taste in juicy vegetables

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
like cucumbers and in
creamy, grounding vegetables

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
like avocados, beets,
and sweet potatoes.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
The sweet taste is cooling
and it's a little bit heavy,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and so that's going to help to
calm things down, bring us back

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.570 align:middle line:84%
to center, and have
us feeling grounded.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
The other taste we really
want to go for is bitter.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The bitter taste can
be found in things

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.663 align:middle line:84%
like leafy greens
and fresh herbs,

00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:22.580 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to want
to make sure to include

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those in our
diet at this time of year.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.660 align:middle line:84%
The bitter taste is also
cooling, but it's clarifying

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's got some
antiseptic qualities, which

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
are going to help us
with that inflammation

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned earlier
and that infection.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, lastly, we're
going for astringent.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So astringency is a little
bit more like an experience

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:90%
than it is a taste, right?

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:90%
It's an experience of drying.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
find the astringency

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:90%
in things like raw foods--

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:84%
raw fruits and
vegetables apples,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:90%
pears, beans, and lentils--

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
as well as some of those spices
that I mentioned earlier.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And so next, we'll take a look
at some of my favorite summer

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.277 align:middle line:84%
recipes that feature some
of these lovely ingredients

00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to give you a sense for how
to incorporate their balance

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and goodness into your
mind, body, and life.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So let's kick things
off with breakfast.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And breakfast
couldn't be easier,

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.150 align:middle line:90%
especially in the summer.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
What we've got access to in the
summer is some amazing fruits--

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
stone fruits, and plums,
and figs, and pears,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:90%
gorgeous things.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And so what we decided
to do for breakfast here,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.340 align:middle line:90%
incredibly simple.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We're just roasting
these fruits just

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
to make them easier
for the digestion,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and we've mixed them
with some spices that

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:84%
are going to help
bring out the flavor,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.800 align:middle line:84%
but also help with
that digestive process.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So all I've done is gone
to my local farmer's market

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and picked up some of the
best of the fruit on offer.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's things like plums,
nectarines, pears, and apples.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to pick up
whatever looks good.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we cut that
fruit up really easily,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.830 align:middle line:84%
pop it onto a tray, and
then maybe drizzle it

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:90%
with just a little bit of ghee--

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
can leave the ghee
out if you like--

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and then just sprinkle
a little bit of spices.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I've got here cinnamon, I've got
a little bit of fennel powder,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and a teensy bit of cardamom.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It's as simple as that.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Roast that fruit until it
starts to release its juices,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:90%
and then it's ready to eat.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:90%
This dish could not be simpler.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
As you can see here, I've
roasted this fruit in the oven,

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's looking
beautifully juicy.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:84%
All we gotta do is put
some of that into a bowl.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
You can grab some
of your favorites.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that you can add
to this, just to up the cooling

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
factor, is a little
bit of yogurt,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:84%
though I would typically
choose a coconut yogurt

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
in the summer over any of
the other types of yogurt.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And then, lastly, if you
are interested in adding

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.530 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of
texture, I would highly

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
recommend you throw in
maybe some toasted grains.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Nuts are going to be a
little heating for summer,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
but it's a great time of
year to make use of seeds.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And so pumpkin seeds are
a great choice for summer.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And I always like to top this
with just a few pumpkin seeds

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.860 align:middle line:90%
for flavor and a gorgeous color.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.370 align:middle line:84%
There you are, a simple,
roasted, spiced fruit

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:90%
breakfast.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Next, we're going to
feature an ingredient that

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.950 align:middle line:84%
has become almost
synonymous with the summer,

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.070 align:middle line:90%
and that is watermelon.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Watermelon is
cooling, it's juicy,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and that cool heaviness has
a bit of a grounding effect.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I know, personally,
watermelon is

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:84%
one of my absolute favorite
of the summer fruits,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and it brings back a lot
of memories from childhood.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we are putting together
a gorgeous watermelon, lime,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:90%
and rosewater--

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned back before that
rose is a beautiful spice

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:84%
or flavor to incorporate
into your summer recipes,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.145 align:middle line:84%
and this is an incredibly
easy way to do it.

00:06:50.145 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And so all we need
to do is we're

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
going to take some
watermelon that we'd cut up--

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:84%
super easy-- and we just want
to add that to a blender.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
This one is going to
be great for the kids,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
especially if they're
outdoors playing

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and they want a nice, beautiful
thing to cool them down.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
To that, we're going to
add a little bit of lime.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So lime is actually
one of the most

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:90%
cooling of the citrus fruits.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Citrus fruits tend to
be a little bit heating,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
but lime is one of the most
cooling of the citrus fruit,

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:84%
so it's a great one to
use in the summertime.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.125 align:middle line:84%
And the flavor, again, is
like a reminder of summer.

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there's that
secret ingredient

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned
before, rosewater.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit of
rosewater will do the trick,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and it'll bring
through just a hint

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:90%
of that lovely, rose flavor.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:84%
All we want to do is just
add a little bit of water,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.872 align:middle line:90%
blend that up.

00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:50.252 align:middle line:90%

00:07:50.252 --> 00:07:52.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And so there you have it.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.180 align:middle line:90%
It's just that simple.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful summer
melon cooler--

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.670 align:middle line:90%
watermelon, lime, and rosewater.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And so this last dish is an
incredibly versatile dish

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that makes for a
terrific light lunch.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
It can also make a
great snack to share

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
with some friends or
family or, coupled

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:84%
with a few extra
greens, a lovely dinner.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
It features, as I
mentioned before,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
one of the ingredients that
has that beautiful stringent

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
quality that's great
for summer, beans.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
And for this dish,
we're including

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:90%
some lovely white beans.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:90%
So this one is a white bean dip.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
It also features some
lovely, fresh coriander,

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:84%
some beautiful mint, and one
of my secret ingredients,

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
roasted garlic-- a simple
way to really up the flavor

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:90%
on a really easy dish like this.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Putting it together
could not be simpler.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do
is add the beans

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.340 align:middle line:90%
to a processor or a blender.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to throw in
a couple of squeezes

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.310 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite summer
citrus, which is lime.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:90%
A few coriander leaves.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It's going to add some
lovely zing and freshness.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit of mint.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Mint's actually quite
potent, so we just

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.270 align:middle line:84%
want to add a
little bit of that.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Squeeze in some of that
luscious, roasted garlic.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.090 align:middle line:84%
We'll add a little
bit of olive oil

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and a couple of pinches
of salt. And now

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.797 align:middle line:90%
is when we give it a blend.

00:09:54.797 --> 00:09:57.082 align:middle line:90%

00:09:57.082 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And so as I mentioned, this
is incredibly versatile.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite
ways of having this

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
is as a really
simple, light dinner.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So a throw in just a few
gorgeous little greens here

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:84%
in a bowl, and I'm
just going to spoon

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.410 align:middle line:90%
some of this luscious dip.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can just spoon
some of this luscious dip

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:28.060 align:middle line:84%
into the bowl or a
plate, and accompany

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.950 align:middle line:84%
that with some
beautiful, fresh bread.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:90%
There you are.
