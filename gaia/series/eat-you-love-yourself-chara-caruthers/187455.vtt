00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CHARA CARUTHERS:
So we have made it

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.500 align:middle line:84%
to the last episode
of this lovely series.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And in this one, we are
going to be talking about one

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.700 align:middle line:84%
of the most important healing
principles of Ayurveda.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:90%
But first, a little background.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.882 align:middle line:84%
So according to Ayurveda,
we are digesting machines.

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we come into
contact with-- think about it,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
all the food and the ideas,
the thoughts, the information--

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
our mind-body complex has
to digest all of this.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It has to process
and assimilate it

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
in order to extract
the goodness,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.817 align:middle line:84%
in order to extract what's
going to nourish and support us.

00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think
about everything

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.860 align:middle line:84%
that you come into contact
with every single day,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.130 align:middle line:84%
you realize this is a really
big job for the mind and body

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And so what typically
happens is the fact

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that we take in so
much information really

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
puts a burden on our
mind-body digestive system.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
It makes it difficult for us
to process all the ideas or all

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:90%
the information.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It makes it difficult
for our bodies

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
to really process all the
food that we're taking in.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And that impacts how
we actually feel.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And it shows up as symptoms,
like sluggishness or lethargy,

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
foggy brain,
headaches, insomnia,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and a whole host of other
issues that have become

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.920 align:middle line:90%
pretty common for a lot of us.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the Ayurvedic approach
to re-establishing our natural

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:90%
harmony is simple--

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.335 align:middle line:90%
eliminate the bad stuff.

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
things that make

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:84%
you feel heavy or blocked or
weak, less connected and less

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.860 align:middle line:84%
motivated and really just
less than who you really are.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.317 align:middle line:84%
And we want to add or
maintain the good stuff.

00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
things that are going

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel light and
strong, aware, connected,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.800 align:middle line:90%
and clear.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And so these two things,
in the simplest terms,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
are the way that we
describe cleansing, right?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Eliminate the bad stuff
and maintain or add

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:90%
some of the good stuff.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And so Ayurvedic
cleansing is a process

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:84%
of carving out time
to connect deeply

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:90%
with your own inner knowing.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
That means creating some space
to listen to that voice that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:84%
understands better than
your friends or your family

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.360 align:middle line:84%
or even your society
what you need to do

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and who you need to
be in order to live

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.670 align:middle line:84%
in the most powerful and
healthy way possible.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
It's also a process of easing
the burden on the mind, right?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Letting go of
self-limiting thoughts

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
or letting go of all of
the information and things

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
that you really don't need,
that aren't really serving you.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And then lastly, it's a
process of easing the burden

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:90%
on the body--

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
so giving your body a
little bit of space,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of time to do
the work that it's actually

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
meant to do, easing that burden,
so that your digestive system,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
mind-body digestive systems,
can build themselves,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:90%
become stronger.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And so Ayurvedic cleansing
is about nourishing

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
the mind and body in a way
that does not overburden it.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
starving yourself.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about feeding
ourselves with love.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, we take
in foods that are light,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that are simple, that
are easy to digest,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:90%
and that are tasty as well.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And so today, I want to
introduce you to kitchari.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So kitchari's a really
simple dish, easy to make,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's sometimes considered
Ayurvedic chicken soup.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a dish that is
incredibly nourishing

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.553 align:middle line:84%
and that we typically
eat when we're cleansing.

00:03:42.553 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you are
cleansing, you might

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.550 align:middle line:84%
have maybe one or two
meals a day of kitchari,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps nothing else,
for as short a time as a day

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps for as long a time
as maybe a week to 10 days,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.942 align:middle line:84%
or possibly even
a couple of weeks.

00:03:55.942 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk a little bit
about what kitchari actually

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So quite simply, kitchari is a
mix of a couple of ingredients.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, it's
a split mung dal.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And mung dal is a very
interesting legume.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I've mentioned prior
legumes and beans have

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:90%
a drying and a cooling quality.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.209 align:middle line:84%
Well, mung dal has that,
but it's also tridoshic.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So it tends to balance
all of the doshas.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And this one's a split.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:90%
So the holes have been removed.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's been split in two.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.633 align:middle line:90%
And that's the yellow one.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'll see mung dal
as the green, the whole beans.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
But this is the same bean,
but in a different form.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the other ingredient,
typical ingredient in kitchari

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.960 align:middle line:90%
is rice.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:84%
We like to go with a
nice long grain rice.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And so, typically, we'll
use a basmati rice, in part

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:84%
because it's quite
easy to digest,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:90%
and it's fast and easy to cook.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we combine these
two things, these two

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:84%
lovely ingredients,
which together

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
create a complete
protein for the body.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:90%
There's the nourishment.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
We also add some gorgeous
spices that actually

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:90%
help to fire up your digestion.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And I also will
typically, when cleansing,

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:84%
add some vegetables as well,
just up the nutrient factor.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the beauty of kitchari,
besides how great it tastes,

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a dish that you
can make in just a single pot.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got
everything here.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
You can add some of your
favorite vegetables.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We've got all the spices, the
rice, the beans, all of that.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And all you need to
do is serve and enjoy.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:84%
The other great
thing about kitchari

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.220 align:middle line:84%
is that you can change
the texture of it.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it everything
from nice and soupy

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.160 align:middle line:90%
to a little drier.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you can add
to reduce water

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to suit your own
personal taste in terms

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of whether you like
things a little bit dryer

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.215 align:middle line:84%
or whether you prefer
to have something

00:05:47.215 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
that's a little bit more
soothing and a little more

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:90%
souplike.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you, this one
is a family favorite.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of my
favorites as well.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's nice to know that
you're being good to your body

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.460 align:middle line:84%
while you're also
eating something

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.137 align:middle line:84%
that is incredibly delicious
and warming and nourishing.

00:06:09.137 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:90%
So there you are-- the kitchari.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:90%
