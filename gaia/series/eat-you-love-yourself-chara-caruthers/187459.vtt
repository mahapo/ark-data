00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello and welcome to "Eat
Like You Love Yourself",

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
a guide to discovering your own
unique formula for thriving.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And today, I want to fill you
in on what eating like you

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.170 align:middle line:90%
love yourself actually means.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's just touch
on why eating like you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:90%
love yourself is so important.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So according to the Centers for
Disease Control in the United

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:84%
States, chronic
diseases and conditions

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
like heart disease, cancer,
type 2 diabetes, obesity,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
and arthritis are among
the most common, costly,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and preventable of
all health problems.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is lifestyle
choices like what we eat

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and how we exercise are among
the biggest risk factors

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:90%
for contracting these issues.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.130 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that we
are making ourselves sick.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is that
these same lifestyle factors

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
are some of our
most powerful tools

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:84%
for preventing and
managing these same issues.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Another reason why
learning to eat

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:84%
like you love
yourself makes sense

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
is that there are so many voices
and so much conflicting advice

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
out there these days
about how to live

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and how to eat that
we are more confused

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:84%
about how to
experience and create

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
wholeness than we
have ever been.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And our confusion
is actually creating

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
an experience of complacency,
and fear, and self-judgment

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
rather than fostering the
curiosity, and acceptance,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and empowerment that's
necessary for us

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.325 align:middle line:84%
to truly discover our own
unique formula for thriving.

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to acknowledge
you for having the curiosity

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
to join me on this
journey of understanding

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.082 align:middle line:90%
and loving yourself better.

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And with that said,
let's talk about some

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:84%
of the more practical aspects of
eating like you love yourself.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I am a huge fan of
keeping things simple,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and so I have developed
three simple rules

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:84%
for eating like
you love yourself

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.670 align:middle line:84%
based on the ancient healing and
living principles of Ayurveda.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Number one, eat seasonally.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So this comes from
an understanding

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
that what goes on outside of us
actually goes on inside of us

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:90%
as well, right?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
We change as the environments
around us change,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
with the natural world

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.400 align:middle line:84%
is such that it
supports our needs.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So eating seasonally
means eating

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.143 align:middle line:84%
the foods that come out of the
ground where and when you are.

00:02:33.143 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Those are the foods
that are going

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
to have the qualities that
you need to experience balance

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.103 align:middle line:90%
in that season.

00:02:39.103 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:84%
They're also going
to be the foods

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.603 align:middle line:84%
it'll be most economical,
so eat what grows near you.

00:02:43.603 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
do that, discover

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
what's in season where you
are and choose those items

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:90%
from your local grocery store.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Number two, keep
your fire burning.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So according to Ayurveda,
we are digesting machines.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Within each of us burns of
fire, a metabolic capacity

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
for breaking down and processing
all of the different things

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
that we come into contact
with so that we can extract

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
the nutrients, the things that
are going to feed us, and let

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
go of everything
else-- all those things

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.305 align:middle line:90%
that don't serve us.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:90%
And so imagine that.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Every sight and
sound, every idea

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and every emotion, every
piece of information

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
that you come into contact
with has to actually

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:90%
be processed by your body mind.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And as you can imagine,
that is no small job.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got to safeguard
our mental, and emotional,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and physical systems
for digestion

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
by ensuring that, like a
fire, we don't overload them

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and also that we feed them with
the sorts of foods and fuel

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that can support and
keep them burning strong.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
In a food sense, this
would mean including

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:84%
things like spices
and foods that promote

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:90%
gut health in your diet.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, you're going
to want to choose balance.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So most of us eat
according to patterns

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
that were set either as
children or at some point

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:90%
in our adulthood.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And while there is nothing wrong
with patterns and routines,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
what they sometimes take
away from us is our ability

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to be present and responsive to
our current moment experience--

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.470 align:middle line:84%
so things like
how hungry we are,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:84%
or our mental and
emotional state,

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%
or how well our systems of
digestion and elimination

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:90%
are working.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.120 align:middle line:84%
So food is a powerful tool
for helping to create balance

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:90%
in all of these areas.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And so tuning into where
we are and what we need

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
is a really vital
part of determining

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:90%
what to cook and eat.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Because when we commit
to choosing balance,

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
it means that rather than
disconnecting from ourselves

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and from our choices--

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%
which can sometimes
lead to things

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
like using food
for entertainment,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:90%
or for comfort, or for therapy--

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
we would make a more
empowered choice

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
to eat in a way that
supports our wholeness

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:90%
and our needs in the moment.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, ultimately,
eating like you

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
love yourself means
knowing yourself.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And that means getting
honest with yourself

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
about how hungry you are,
about the physical, mental,

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.190 align:middle line:84%
and emotional baggage
that you're carrying.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It means asking yourself what
your mind and body really need,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and also what it would look
like to choose yourself.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And it also means
knowing your food.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So what are the qualities
of the foods that

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:84%
can support your need to lighten
up, to feel more grounded,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
and to create clarity, calm,
and resilience in mind and body?
