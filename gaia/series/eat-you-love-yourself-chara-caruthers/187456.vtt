00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, and welcome to
"Eat Like You Love Yourself,"

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:84%
a guide to discovering your
unique formula for thriving.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
getting seasonal.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
taking a closer look

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:84%
at what's going on both
outside and inside,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:84%
so that we can make
empowered choices about what

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to eat to feel amazing during
the autumn and the winter

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:90%
season.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what's
typically happening

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:90%
during this time of year?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, in most parts of the
world, it's getting colder.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It's also getting
a little bit drier.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of change is associated
with this time of year, right?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:84%
The autumn into
the early winter.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And with that change can bring
a little bit of instability

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.287 align:middle line:84%
that can have an impact
on our immune systems.

00:00:55.287 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:90%
And so what are we seeing?

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with
you this time of year?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, the kinds of
things that I see

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
are imbalances that include
things like anxiety, dryness.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes there's a bit
of constipation in there.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Folks tend to be a
little bit fatigued.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And so our seasonal
mantra for balance

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
from the autumn and
the early winter

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
is warming, to offset
some of that cold,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
grounding, just to get us
feeling a little bit better

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.962 align:middle line:84%
in our mind and our
body, moisturizing, just

00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:84%
to counter some of
the dryness that we're

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
experiencing this time of
year, and also routine.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Routine takes out some
of the unknown, which

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
helps to address
some of the anxiety

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:90%
that we might be experiencing.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what types of
foods are we wanting

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:90%
to introduce into our diet?

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to want to introduce
grounding foods, things

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630 align:middle line:84%
like root vegetables, carrots,
beets, sweet potatoes, onions,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
foods that have got a little
bit of a warming quality.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.615 align:middle line:84%
Ghee is a fantastic
thing to be introducing

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:84%
into your diet
this time of year.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Adds a little bit of that
moisture, some of that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.950 align:middle line:84%
lubrication that
we're so needing.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And so how are we going to
want to eat this time of year?

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.187 align:middle line:84%
And how do we introduce some
of these foods into our diet?

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going
to want to make sure

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.758 align:middle line:84%
that everything that
we eat is cooked,

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
as well as that we're going to
want to make sure everything's

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:90%
well-spiced.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And so let's start
with breakfast.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite and
probably the easiest breakfasts

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
is just porridge,
just simple oats.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.007 align:middle line:84%
But that can actually
be a little bit boring.

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
going to do is we're

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
going to spice it up
by putting together

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:90%
a gorgeous, sweet dukkah.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Dukkah is typically
an Egyptian spice

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.430 align:middle line:84%
mix that includes
nuts and spices

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and all these beautiful
warming qualities

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.672 align:middle line:90%
and warming ingredients.

00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
create a version

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
that you can use on
things like porridge,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and even on things like yogurt
and some of your other sweeter

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So what are we going
to include in this?

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.055 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are going
to start with nuts.

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Just about any nut is great for
the autumn and the early winter

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:90%
season.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But what we're using
here is some almonds.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've also got some
pistachio nuts here

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and some pumpkin
seeds, some pepitas.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to want to
add in some sesame seeds.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Sesame seeds are beautiful.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:90%
They're warming.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.975 align:middle line:84%
They've got a little
bit of oiliness to them.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:10.392 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
we're going to add

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:11.900 align:middle line:84%
in here for a little
bit of flavor,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit of kick,
is some hibiscus flowers.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to want to
include just a touch of sweet.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm adding
here is jaggery.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So jaggery is this beautiful,
natural unrefined sugar.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And it also has some
terrific nutrients in there,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:90%
like magnesium and phosphorus.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:90%
A really nice natural sweetener.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.420 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to add that in.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We're also going to include
one of my favorite spices,

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:90%
cinnamon.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, we're going to
throw in some fennel seeds.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
start with the nuts.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:90%
So I've got a set of nuts here.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I've crushed them all up.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.805 align:middle line:84%
We're going to add to that a
little bit of our sesame seeds.

00:03:53.805 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.263 align:middle line:84%
I've also crushed up
some hibiscus leaves

00:04:00.263 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
or hibisc-- yeah,
hibiscus leaves.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:90%
Those are dried.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a gorgeous
flavor, hibiscus.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to add some fennel
seeds, which I've crushed up

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:84%
just in a mortar and pestle,
some gorgeous cinnamon

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
sticks, which I've toasted
and also crushed up.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
You can also just use powdered
cinnamon, which is nice.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, lastly, I've crushed
up some of the jaggery.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.313 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go ahead
and add a little bit of that

00:04:24.313 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:90%
in, too.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So all we got to do is
just mix this together.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:90%
And there you have it--

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.747 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful sweet dukkah.

00:04:39.747 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And so what we want to
do with that is we're

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.750 align:middle line:84%
going to take our plain old
everyday porridge oats, just

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:90%
some oatmeal.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Wah.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're just going to
top it with a little bit

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:90%
of this dukkah.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Gorgeous stuff.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.713 align:middle line:84%
I also like to make the
oats with a little bit

00:05:02.713 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
of spice, too, maybe a
little bit of cinnamon,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of fennel seed.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's spiced up oats
for autumn and early winter.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So another way to incorporate
warming spices into your diet

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as getting
some moisture into you

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
is to make one of my
favorite warm drinks.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.175 align:middle line:90%
And it's just simple.

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:90%
It's spice water.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
with spice water

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
is we're incorporating some
spices and some tastes that

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.850 align:middle line:84%
are going to stimulate
the digestion

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
into some simple
warm water that you

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:90%
can drink throughout the day.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.413 align:middle line:84%
So the way that I
usually make it is I

00:05:34.413 --> 00:05:36.660 align:middle line:84%
take a really-- just
a little teapot.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to throw
in a cinnamon stick.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Cinnamon's great.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:90%
Terrific flavor.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I also will typically
throw in just a few slices

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:90%
of fresh ginger.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Fresh ginger is
really important.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm also
going to squeeze

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.887 align:middle line:90%
in just a little bit of lemon.

00:05:50.887 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, I'm just going
to throw some warm water.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Could not be simpler.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I usually will let this sit
for maybe three minutes,

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe five minutes if you
want it incredibly flavorful,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
before just pouring
it into a cup.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And I sip on this
throughout the day.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.645 align:middle line:84%
So we've got you
covered for breakfast.

00:06:11.645 --> 00:06:13.812 align:middle line:84%
We've got you covered for
something to keep you nice

00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:90%
and warm throughout the day.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit
about lunch and dinner.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.813 align:middle line:84%
So what I've put
together for you today

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.230 align:middle line:84%
is something that
you can actually

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
take for either of those two
things, which is really great.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:90%
I love these two for one things.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned at
the beginning, we're

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:84%
wanting to incorporate
these gorgeous root

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
vegetables-- they're
nice and grounding--

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.510 align:middle line:84%
into our diet this time of
year, as well as the spices.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've put together
is a super simple Buddha

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:90%
bowl for autumn and winter.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So we're using, for our
Buddha bowl, a base of quinoa.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a gorgeous grain
for this time of year.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I've done for
a little bit of flavor

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:84%
is I've thrown in a few
cranberries into the mix.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:90%
I've roasted up some vegetables.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I've cut up some
pieces of sweet potato,

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:90%
some beautiful red onion.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.330 align:middle line:84%
We've got some green
beans, and also

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:90%
some gorgeous fennel bulbs.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I've thrown those in with
a little bit of ghee,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.740 align:middle line:84%
some paprika, a
little bit of cumin

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit of
salt for that spice.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to use
those on top of our bowl

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:84%
with a wonderful
tahini dressing.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to add
our veggies to the bowl.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one more
piece of onion.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Another lovely green bean.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.875 align:middle line:84%
And then to that, just to
tie the whole thing together,

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
we're going to add a little
bit of tahini dressing.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go ahead
and put the tahini

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
dressing on top of this luscious
autumn and winter Buddha bowl.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And as I said before,
this is something

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually have
for lunch or for dinnertime

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:90%
during the autumn season.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.248 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
those things that's

00:07:52.248 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
really easy for a family,
because you can pick and choose

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.618 align:middle line:84%
the vegetables that you like,
but it's also nice and hearty,

00:07:57.618 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:84%
so it'll keep you
nice and satisfied.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:90%
