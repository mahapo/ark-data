00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:12.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle line:90%
- I am a mineral geek.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.860 align:middle line:10%
I didn't make that up.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:10%
People just started
calling me that because I

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:10%
couldn't stop talking about
how minerals changed my life.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Let me rewind.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a winter of 2010.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:10%
I'm in my bathtub.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.133 align:middle line:90%
I have a washcloth over my face.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a lot of pain,
and the pain I'm feeling

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
is due to the four
sinus infections

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:90%
I've had in six months.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I've been struggling
to take care of my kids

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and continue my
corporate career.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I've just been feeling
so bad for so long.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of you
have had an experience

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
like this, a health crisis
that brought you down.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's one of the things
that brought you here today.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:10%
My journey started
as a young person

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.580 align:middle line:10%
with autoimmune gluten
intolerance and mold exposure

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:10%
and grew throughout my life
into a myriad of complex health

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:10%
issues that I went to
practitioners and doctors

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:10%
and healers trying to heal
one by one by one by one.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:84%
But always in the
back of my mind,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:84%
there was some sort of
intuition that perhaps there

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:84%
was something that was
at the source of all

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:90%
of this dysfunction.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, not long after
the bathtub incident,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to something
called plant-based minerals.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were
really easy to take.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:90%
They're a liquid substance.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Tastes like water.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, I hate taking
supplements, but they were easy

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.539 align:middle line:90%
so I kept taking them.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, two months in,
I met my dentist.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
It's been an incredible ordeal
to have my teeth cleaned.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
They're in my mouth and
I'm sitting there going,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:90%
there's no pain.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm so surprised.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:90%
The dentist comes in.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
She looks in my
mouth and exclaims,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.960 align:middle line:84%
the tissues look pink and
healthy and my pH in my mouth

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:90%
has completely changed.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of thinking,
is it the minerals?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So four months in,
I'm at my naturopath.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We're reviewing the results
of the adrenal test.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
She looks down at the
paper, looks up at me,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
smiles, turns it
around so I can see it.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And my adrenals that have been
flatlined for 2 and 1/2 years

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
are now 1/3 of the
way up the chart.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, is
it the minerals?

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I go through one season, two
seasons, no sinus infection.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm really starting
to feel good.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And over the space of
about eight or nine months,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.720 align:middle line:84%
most of my chronic
symptoms cleared.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm left with this
incredible curiosity.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.020 align:middle line:84%
How could this small,
1 ounce glass of liquid

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
make such a profound
difference in my health?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not a practitioner,
I'm not a scientist,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a researcher,
but I love to learn

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and I believe there are
no stupid questions.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:90%
So I start asking.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And I delve into
minerals and how

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
they work in the
body and mineral

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
depletion and its effects
and how mineral replenishment

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:90%
actually works.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And I start to have aha
moment after aha moment

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:90%
after aha moment.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And the first aha
I have is that I

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
begin to see this whole body as
a single holistic biome, a set

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
of cellular systems
that work together

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
in a myriad of
seemingly magical ways

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
to allow me to stand
here talking to you,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to grow whole
babies in my belly,

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
to think, and to
feel, and to dream.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't stop there.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
I just keep asking
more questions

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and I get smaller and
smaller till I find myself

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
inside the cells, looking at
how things operate in there.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
find the challenge.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
I realize that my cells have
been struggling for years.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And at the source
of that struggle

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
is something called
the mitochondria.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:84%
These energy-generating
units produce

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:90%
all of the energy in this body.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.990 align:middle line:84%
To give you a sense of scale, on
my arm here, in a single cell,

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:84%
there's maybe 12
to 15 mitochondria.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
In my heart in a single cell,
3,000 to 5,000 mitochondria.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And in my brain, there could
be over 40,000 mitochondria

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:90%
in a single cell.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine how much energy
it takes to fuel this body

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:90%
moment by moment by moment.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So I start asking, what
fuels the mitochondria?

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I have
the next big aha moment.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
You see, we've been taught
to think about our body

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a car.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:90%
You need oil, put in oil.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:90%
You need gas, put in gas.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said we need 320
of magnesium each day.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So take a pill and
fill up the tank.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.670 align:middle line:84%
The replenishment
system in this body

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:84%
to get those minerals
into the mitochondria

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work at all like that.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:90%
There's no tank.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
If you go to your
health food store

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and you see the mineral
aisle, and there's

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
pill bottle after pill
bottle and maybe some drinks

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and some powders,
maybe most of them

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
have one mineral or maybe two,
maybe three or four, maybe five.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But your body needs a
full spectrum of minerals.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
That supplement graveyard
that we all have at home

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:90%
is a testament to most of it.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
The fact that most of
it just doesn't work.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking at
what the difference is.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
You see, in that
one glass of liquid

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that I take each day is that
full spectrum of minerals

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
formulated by nature
in the exact ratios

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that my body is made of
and utilizes of minerals.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Think of that.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Nature, of course, guess what?

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:53.210 align:middle line:84%
We came from single-celled
beings and multicellular beings.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
So there had to be a
technology evolved on the earth

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to get the minerals which were
so key to energy production

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.100 align:middle line:84%
so that those cellular
systems could thrive.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is called
plant-based minerals.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It's mother nature's mineral
replenishment technology.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Your body already utilizes it
and has evolved to utilize it.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You see, that's what
was happening to me.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I was simply getting
remineralized so

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
that my body could produce
the full amount of energy

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.510 align:middle line:90%
that my cells needed.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't magic.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:90%
It was science.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Fuel the mitochondria,
energize the body.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.670 align:middle line:84%
It was just like
I felt like I was

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.805 align:middle line:90%
coming alive from the inside.

00:08:53.805 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm Caroline,
and I'm just a mineral geek.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:90%
