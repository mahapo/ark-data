00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Hola, hola.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Hola, hola.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle line:10%
>> So thinking on purpose, if
you change the way you think,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
it changes what you feel.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:10%
And it changes what you can do.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are going to learn
some skills to re-engineer

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
our inner voice, how
we talk to ourselves.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And the great news
is that this also

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:84%
works wonderfully for
our outer voice, when

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:90%
we talk to other people.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is for most
of us, the neurotics,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that generally, when we say
something bad to ourselves,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
we say it with such confidence
and conviction like, I

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:90%
am so stupid.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And then when we say
something good to ourselves,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:84%
we tend to say it with
such doubt and uncertainty,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.975 align:middle line:84%
like, I can make my
dreams come true?

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So it is time to
re-engineer that.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:90%
We can change this.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to do
this using two rules.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:84%
The first rule, I call
it the James Bond rule.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
how we use tonality.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And it says that when we
use a tonality going down,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:84%
it messages certainty and
conviction to the unconscious

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
mind, both ours
and other people's.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we use a
tonality going up,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
it messages doubt
and uncertainty.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But let me explain
this with an example.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:90%
We all know who is James Bond.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we think
about James Bond,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:84%
we think he's confident,
strong, assertive.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And how does he
introduce himself?

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
You're probably thinking
this in your head.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:90%
My name is Bond, James Bond.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Tonality going down.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
But imagine if he would have
introduced himself like this.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:90%
My name is Bond, James Bond.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, something changed.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the same words.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But it feels
completely different

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:90%
in the unconscious mind.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And how can we use this in our
daily life to improve our life?

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we say something
good to ourselves,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
let's say it with a
tonality going down.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:90%
It works with the inner voice.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And it also works
with the outer voice.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So for example, it
will be very different

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:84%
if we introduce ourselves,
for example, like this:

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:90%
My name is Maria.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm a health coach.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I teach you how to optimize
yourself, than if we say,

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:90%
my name is Maria.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:90%
I am a health coach.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I teach you how to
optimize yourself.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Cool, right?

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's move then to
the second rule.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:90%
And it is the round voice rule.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
The round voice rule says that
if we use a voice that comes

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:84%
from this part of the body,
not this part, not this part,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
but from here, a voice
that comes from here,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.170 align:middle line:84%
it opens a door to the
unconscious mind, again,

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:90%
both ours and other people's.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is also called a
persuasive voice or a hypnotic

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:90%
voice.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:84%
This is why we enjoy listening
to people who speak like this.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:84%
But if somebody
speaks like this,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, we don't
like it too much.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.270 align:middle line:90%
There's a resistance.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, here I'm
going to the extremes.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
But most of us are
somewhere in the middle

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:90%
of these two extremes.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And how do we know and how can
we make our voice more round?

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:84%
There is something
called an oscilloscope.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is a free app in
every store where you

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:90%
can download this oscilloscope.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you to see
the waves of your voice

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.560 align:middle line:90%
in real time.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can talk to the
oscilloscope and practice making

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:90%
your voice as round as possible.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Now it comes the most fun
part, that is, using this

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and having fun, using these
tools in your daily life.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Just one tip because I know
you're going to use it.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to have fun.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:10%
Then when you meet your
loved ones, your friends,

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:10%
your clients, it
will be important

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:10%
that when you use the James Bond
rule, the tonality and the round

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:10%
voice rule, that you make a
smooth transition from the way

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:10%
you are talking now to
using these rules so

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:10%
that it is an organic change.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It is not that maybe today,
you arrive home and you say,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:90%
today we are going to do it.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So remember to
have fun practicing

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:90%
these tools in your daily life.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:90%
And also remember, life is good.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Life is wonderful.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:90%
