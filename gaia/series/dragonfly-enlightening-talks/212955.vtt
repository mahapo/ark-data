00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.239 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to take you
back to three years ago.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:22.450 align:middle line:10%
I was mid-30s, single, in LA,
desperately wanting babies,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:10%
and feeling that
biological clock ticking.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully I was in
very good company.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Many of my peers were in
the exact same situation

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:84%
as were many of the women
coming into my practice.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The truth is women are
waiting longer to conceive.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And this is a beautiful thing.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We're more relationship
stable, financially stable,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:90%
emotionally stable.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
We've had time to have
fulfilling careers

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:90%
and do our inner work.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.445 align:middle line:84%
But the biological clock hasn't
quite caught up with society.

00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Now I had something that
my peers and my patients

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:90%
did not have.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I had seven years of
experience witnessing what

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:90%
many would consider miracles.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, I had a 42-year-old
woman come into my office.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
She had, had a failed round
of IVF at 36, zero embryos.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Failed round of IVF at 40,
zero embryos came to me at 42.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.690 align:middle line:10%
If fertility is
really about age,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:10%
then I should not have been able
to get her any better results.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But after a number of
months working together,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and one final round of
IVF, she and her husband

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:90%
got nine grade A embryos.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Pretty impressive, right?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So this showed me that fertility
is about more than chronological

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Despite what we're told, we
know that infertility rates

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:90%
are rising.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And we know that age is
the number one risk factor.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:90%
But I had seen differently.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:84%
It did not stop me from
feeling the pressure

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
of my own biological
clock ticking.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Now until I learned
about biological age.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So biological age is the
age of our cells, which

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:84%
is different from
chronological age, which

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:84%
is how old we are based on our
birthday, which we can't change

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:90%
unless we're forging documents.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Whereas biological age is a
marker of cellular health.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
An advanced biological
age is actually

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:84%
an increased risk factor
for every disease, including

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:90%
infertility.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But we've actually known
this before science.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can have two
women who are 40 years old

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and one can look closer to 30
and one can look closer to 50.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But the same thing is
happening on the inside.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.620 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know
until we test,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:90%
inter-biological age testing.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to
this in my practice.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And like with most
things in my practice,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try
it on myself first.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And with my knowledge
and my experience

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:84%
helping optimize
health and fertility,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:84%
I was literally convinced I
was doing everything right.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was convinced I was
going to come back at 28.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I was 33 at the time.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But I was so convinced
I am doing my sample

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and chanting to
myself 28, 28, 28.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:90%
So I send my sample off.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:90%
I get my results.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And imagine my surprise when
I don't come back at 28,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't even come back at 33.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I came back four years older.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'm mid-30s,
single, in LA, wanting babies.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:84%
This is a fertility
death sentence.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Woof.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So my first response, very
logical, complete denial.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this has nothing
to do with fertility.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the research.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, found
a paper showing

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that advanced biological age,
meaning biological age was older

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
than chronological age, did show
poorer outcomes in fertility,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.982 align:middle line:84%
meaning women got fewer
eggs, fewer healthy embryos

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:84%
when they were
going through things

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:90%
like egg freezing and IVF.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
This is what we
have research on.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It also showed that
even younger women.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So someone who was
chronologically 28 who we think

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
should be healthy,
vital, fertile.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
If her biological age came
back older, let's say 30,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:84%
she had poorer outcomes
with egg retrieval and IVF.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So between this and my
42-year-old female with nine

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
grade A embryos,
I had lots of data

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
showing that
biological age was more

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.960 align:middle line:84%
important than
chronological age when

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
it came to fertility to a point
menopause is still real so far.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But this meant that I
had to face the music.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
My results were real,
which brought me

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
to my second response, which
was an emotional meltdown.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So I let myself get into fetal
position on my bedroom floor.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:90%
I let my heart crack open.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I let the tears
flow down my eyes.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And I imagined a
world where I never

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
got to be a mother
because time ran out.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not one
to give up easily.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely believe in
the healing power of the body.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
So after I let the emotions move
through, I picked myself back up

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and I made it my
mission to figure out

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:84%
how to rewind that biological
clock first for myself,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and then for every
single woman who

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
feels the pressure of the
biological clock ticking.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So I went to what
was working, what

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.798 align:middle line:84%
was working in my practice, what
was working in the research.

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, there
were only two papers

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
published showing it was
even possible to rewind

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:90%
the biological clock.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was using medications.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't about to put
myself on medications.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So I reworked those mechanisms
of action, put myself

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
on a lifestyle protocol for
eight weeks, and I retested.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:90%
I got my results.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:90%
And I was elated.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I had rewound my biological
clock by a full two years

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.677 align:middle line:90%
in eight weeks.

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what you did.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:90%
We'll get there.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:84%
More research was
coming out at the time.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So over the next year,
I tweaked my protocol.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And on my 35th
birthday, I retested.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And on my 35th birthday, I came
back at 31 and three quarters.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:84%
I went from four years older to
four years younger in just about

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:90%
a year.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:90%
That is hope.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So we know that biological
age is the age of our cells.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
We know that biological
age is reversible.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And we know that, that impacts
our fertility outcomes.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:90%
But how does this work?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:90%
We can't change our genes.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:90%
We can't change our DNA.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But we can change how
our genes are expressed.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
We can turn some genes
up and some genes down.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And biological age is
a reflection of which

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:90%
genes are turned up and down.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, younger biological
age is telling us

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
that more good genes are
turned up and more bad genes

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:90%
are turned down.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is important for
more than just conception.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:84%
We now know that
these gene knobs,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
we actually pass them
down to our babies.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And this sets their health up
for the rest of their lives.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So what turns these
knobs up and down.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything we eat, drink,
breathe, touch, think, and feel.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, we have
a lot more research now,

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
thanks to Dr. David Sinclair,
Dr. Kara Fitzgerald.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And we even have Bryan Johnson
has brought biological age

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
reversal to the mainstream
media through his rejuvenation

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Olympics, which I must say
I was number 44 out of 8,000

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.870 align:middle line:90%
for a period of time.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So I have distilled
down the things

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that rewind the biological
clock into an acronym.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
We call it the FAST
framework, F-A-S-T.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:90%
And it works pretty fast.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Fs are food,
fasting, and fitness.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.580 align:middle line:84%
A is associated conditions,
things like insulin resistance,

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.290 align:middle line:90%
hypothyroidism.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
S is sleep, stress,
supplementation.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:90%
T's are toxins and trauma.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And the two that were
most important for me

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
were also the ones I
was most resistant to,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:84%
which were fasting
and stress management.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say they
paid off in years.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Now I also experienced
other benefits

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
from rewinding my
biological clock.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:90%
I had lost weight.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I had more energy in focus.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
My hair and skin
looked fabulous.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, the
most comfort came

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
from knowing that my
ovaries were younger.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So we know what
things are we can use

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:90%
to rewind the biological clock.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.722 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that these
are the same things that

00:08:27.722 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:84%
age us on the
outside, just like we

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.780 align:middle line:84%
had those two 40-year-old women
who looked very different ages.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine a friend who
had childhood trauma, maybe

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:84%
loves to party,
very stressful job,

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:90%
maybe she smokes here and there.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
She's probably not the youngest
looking friend in the group.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be that way, though.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
We do see that advanced
chronological age

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:90%
does impact fertility.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:84%
It's because women with
more chronological years

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
have more years of stress,
more years of toxin exposure,

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:84%
more years of poor sleep,
more years of poor diet.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have
to be this way.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't anybody talking about
this in the fertility field?

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Honestly conventional fertility
is a bit discouraging.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes couples
are told to just keep

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:84%
trying for up to a year before
any testing is even done.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
This seems counterintuitive
for an industry

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that puts so much
emphasis on time and age.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:90%
It's time for a paradigm shift.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Every couple and
every woman needs

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:84%
to know that the choices she
makes every single day, even

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
a decade before she
wants to conceive impact

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
how fast their biological
clock is ticking.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And if they can have a healthy
baby on their timeline.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:84%
The future of fertility
starts right now.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.010 align:middle line:90%
The clock is ticking either way.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's use our ticks wisely.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's take test early, take
action, and make our ticks count

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have healthy
babies on our timeline.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.075 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm living the
life that I hope for,

00:09:55.075 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
for every single
one of my patients.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm enjoying being newly
engaged to the love of my life.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm enjoying a fulfilling
career, creating families.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm enjoying knowing that
my body is ready for baby

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:90%
when I am.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And that is way less pressure.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I can relax and I can
actually enjoy life every day

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
because I know that
time is on my side.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:90%
And it can be for you too.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.080 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:90%
