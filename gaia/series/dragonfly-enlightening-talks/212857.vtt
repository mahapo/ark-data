00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.483 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.483 --> 00:00:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of you may
resonate with this.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But being a single,
divorced mother on welfare

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:90%
was really, really hard.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:10%
But this particular
day, it was October.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.280 align:middle line:90%
It was chilly.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of felt like
I had it all together.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I got up.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:90%
I got showered in record time.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I got my daughter cleaned,
dressed, breakfast.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I had even meditated
twice that week.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking,
yes, I got this.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:90%
I got this.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, and I even
looked a little cute

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
because I had my
little outfit on.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to
take her to lunch.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're playing in the morning
and going about our day.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.687 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
finally, finally,

00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting the pieces together.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Like maybe because I'm
doing all the right things

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.560 align:middle line:84%
to the best of my
ability, maybe I got this.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing about
doing all the right things.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
If they're not
right for you, you

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
are in for a world of potential
pain and disappointment.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.150 align:middle line:90%
So we went to lunch.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.017 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't have much money.

00:01:32.017 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But I had enough money to
get her a healthy lunch.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So we went to a
health food store.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was all proud
that no one else

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:84%
would know that I was on welfare
because I was in this really

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:90%
nice health food store.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.902 align:middle line:90%
And we bought lunch.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And we went up into
the food court.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting there.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And she's sitting there.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.543 align:middle line:90%
And she's in a high chair.

00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:90%
And we're laughing.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And we're eating.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And she was eating
mac and cheese.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.420 align:middle line:90%
And I had chicken.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.820 align:middle line:90%
And I bit into a chicken bone.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And both of our lives
changed forever.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.740 align:middle line:90%
So let me back up.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I had a lifelong stress-based
grand mal seizure

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.090 align:middle line:84%
disorder since I was a teenager
that was non-epileptic.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:84%
That meant they had
no idea what it was.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what non-epileptic
seizures mean at that time

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to the Western
medicine community.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I went with
no actual diagnosis,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
with no medical protocol,
with no medications.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And here I am eating
lunch with my daughter.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And one minute I'm there,
and the next minute I'm gone.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So apparently biting down
hard into the chicken bone

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
created this explosive
cascade of overwhelming stress

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
in my nervous system
instantaneously.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:90%
And what happened was I seized.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:84%
I flipped into
the plate of food.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I flipped over backwards out of
my chair, landed on the ground,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and then woke up I don't know
how long later to paramedics.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So let me just tell
you a little bit

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.975 align:middle line:84%
about what happens in a grand
mal clonic-tonic seizure.

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:84%
In my case, my heart stopped,
which was not new for me.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.800 align:middle line:84%
This had happened four or
five times before this.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It's called bradycardia
where your heart plummets

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:90%
very rapidly.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep doing
that in seizures,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:90%
you get really good at it.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:90%
And it gets faster.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.132 align:middle line:90%
And then, eventually, it stops.

00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:90%
So my heart stopped.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
My reticular activating system
in the middle of my brain

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
shut off, which meant my brain
had no oxygen, therefore,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.750 align:middle line:90%
couldn't work.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:90%
So I'm unconscious.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm out long enough
for paramedics to come.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how long that is.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you
what it's like to wake

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.690 align:middle line:90%
up from one of those.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:90%
You can't speak.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:90%
You can't move.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a sense of time.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't really
create clear thoughts.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.180 align:middle line:90%
You can't hold your urine.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:90%
You can't hold your bowels.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the icing
on the cake, you

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:90%
vomit on top of all of that.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
when you wake up.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:90%
And so I opened my eyes.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.960 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, I'm on
the floor urinating.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Where's-- I had my daughter.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I had a daughter.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:90%
I have a daughter.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Is she-- I brought my daughter.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:90%
I brought my daughter here.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't see her.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I can't turn my head.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:90%
Where's my daughter?

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Was she with me?

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Was that accurate?

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Was she safe?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Was she abducted?

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And my worst nightmare,
did she see this?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:90%
She runs over.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.430 align:middle line:90%
She's there.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:90%
She puts her hand on my chest.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And she says,
Mommy, did you die?

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:84%
These are not the
conversations you

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
want to have with a
three-year-old ever, ever.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And by the time she was
four, the first sequence

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:84%
of numbers she
ever memorized was

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
911, not her phone number, not
her address, not even her age.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
have a ridiculous seizure

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
disorder to understand the
truth of this dilemma for you.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:84%
All of you right now are
doing everything you possibly

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:84%
can to do your best,
to do the right things,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to be your best, to
learn as much as you

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:90%
can to keep yourself healthy.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're all here
for the same reason.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.847 align:middle line:84%
You haven't attained the
status that you feel you want.

00:06:17.847 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you
wouldn't be here trying

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to get more information, which
means you haven't completely

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:90%
regulated your stress.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.420 align:middle line:84%
You haven't completely
managed your whole lifestyle,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.350 align:middle line:84%
your mental, your
spiritual, emotional,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and you want more,
to feel better.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And this does not get delivered
to you in a one size fits all.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing what
I thought was right.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:90%
I was meditating.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I've been meditating
my whole life.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
How could a meditator have a
stress-based seizure disorder?

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:90%
The light bulbs were going off.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought I was
doing the right thing,

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:90%
but it was not right for me.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Many meditation forms
out there, which

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I love because
they're my lifeline,

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.730 align:middle line:84%
are not always working
with your nervous system.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Some meditations
in some conditions

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:84%
actually work against
your nervous system,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:90%
making you worse.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:90%
So what did I have to do?

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
I had to create a protocol
based on the neuroscience I

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
was studying, a
neuroplasticity protocol

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
so that I could set the
conditions in my mind

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and my nervous
system for everything

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to learn, change, and
adapt to a new way

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
to deal with stress so I could
override my seizure response.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
And that's exactly what I did.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
if this would work.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't plan to
have a business or speak.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to come
through on the promise

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:84%
I made my daughter,
which was I'm

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:84%
not going to die again
on you any time soon.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So I created this protocol
based on the five key things

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
your brain needs in
every single moment

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
in order to be receptive
to learning and adaptation.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And it is called neurosculpting.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's actually really simple.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It's delivered in a
15-minute meditation format.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But your brain needs
these five things.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Number 1, it needs to know
and anchor into anything

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
that is comfortable, familiar,
or predictable so that you can

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:90%
dial down your stress response.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Number 2, your brain needs
to engage recruited focused

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
attention in the front
of the brain playfully,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.502 align:middle line:84%
not too much so you're
stressed, but not going blank

00:08:37.502 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:90%
and letting your thoughts go.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:84%
And that happens with
humor, novelty and wonder.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you do these
first two steps,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
you've induced your brain
and your nervous system

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:84%
to high states of receptivity,
which means you can now tell it

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:84%
something you want it to
rehearse and have it learned

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and get better at it.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So step 3, is you
focus on a perception

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.800 align:middle line:84%
while your body is
receptive and listening.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And you do it with both
sides of your brain engaged

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:84%
so that your nervous
system is just saying yes.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And then step 4, you
anchor it into your body

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
so you have a congruent felt
sense to your perceptions.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And step 5, you give
it a word or a phrase.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you put those five steps
in a 15-minute mental protocol,

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
you can change everything
by way of neuroplasticity.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to leave
you with this thought.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
If a single mother on welfare
with a life-threatening

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
grand mal seizure
disorder can gain agency

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle line:84%
over her nervous
system and improve

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of
her life, then why

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
couldn't you use neurosculpting
to do exactly the same?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:90%
