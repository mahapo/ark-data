00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.260 align:middle line:10%
>> It's worse than I thought,
were the words I heard as I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560 align:middle line:10%
walked back into the doctor's
office after a CT scan

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:10%
on my lungs.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:10%
The viral and
bacterial pneumonia

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:10%
had spread across both my lungs.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
My white blood cell count was
so low, I was neutropenic.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm admitting you, were
the next words I heard.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I felt my world
come crashing down.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
No opportunity to go and
pick up my kids from school.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
No chance to tell
them that mommy

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be coming home
tonight or tomorrow.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:90%
I required immediate admission.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:10%
As a bed was being prepared
for me in intensive care,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.180 align:middle line:10%
I was hooked up to
oxygen and a drip,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:10%
wondering how had I
got to this place.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts of suicide had
created a prison in my own mind.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Three bouts of
post-natal depression

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
had led to a diagnosis of
major depressive disorder.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.290 align:middle line:90%
And I was fighting for my life.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
In a tangled web of guilt and
shame, the thoughts of suicide

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:90%
permeated my every day.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
The only way I could sleep was
to wash down anti-psychotics

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:84%
with wine and warm up
my day with caffeine

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.790 align:middle line:90%
and antidepressants.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
I wondered how had I reached
this state, a mere shadow

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:84%
of myself as the successful
corporate lawyer making

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
partnership at 31, eight months
pregnant with my first child.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Was it the three bouts
of post-natal depression,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:84%
the three C-sections
in 4 and 1/2 years,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
the relentless grit and
hustle to get the deals done?

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:84%
The corporate conditioning
had told me, grace under fire,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.080 align:middle line:84%
pull out all the stops, and
that success had served me well.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
But it had taken a
toll on my health.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And now I had nowhere to
run, not least from myself.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed the universe
was offering me a way out.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But as I lay there in
hospital, I suddenly

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
felt a profound sense of peace,
peace and an OKness being me.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I suddenly felt OK.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I looked at photos
of my children.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
And I felt an overwhelming
sense of joy and peace and love.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And as Dr. David Hawkins
map of consciousness

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
shows us, when we move to
these higher vibrations,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
we move from a contracted state
into a state of expansion.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
As I looked at those photos,
I felt a burning desire

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:90%
to get home to my children.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.110 align:middle line:90%
What had I've been thinking?

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:90%
What was I doing?

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to see them grow up and
be there as a mother to them.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment, I made
a decision, a decision

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:10%
to get well, to get
better than well,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:10%
to be in the best
physical, mental,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual health of my life.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And within 48 hours of
me making that decision,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:90%
my blood work started to change.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:84%
My white blood cell
count started to rise.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I had begun the
journey to heal myself.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, in the words
of Dr. Joe Dispenza,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I had to break the
habit of being me,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
break the habit of washing
down medication with wine just

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to get to sleep, break the
habit of the arm tugging

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.870 align:middle line:84%
from my four-year-old to get
me out of bed in the morning,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
tugging my arm for an hour and
a half saying, mommy, please,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:90%
can we get to school?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I set off on
a journey, a journey

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
to understand what it really
takes to achieve optimal health

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and high performance,
learning from the world's best

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.393 align:middle line:90%
mentors and experts.

00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Women have been
conditioned that we

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
need to behave like men to
succeed in the corporate world,

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.970 align:middle line:90%
the relentless grit and hustle.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But as my former podcast
guest, Dr. Stacy Sims, says,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:90%
"Women are not small men."

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And this relentless
rush and hustle

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:84%
is playing havoc with
our hormonal, adrenal,

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:90%
and immune health.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized there
had to be a smarter way.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Would you agree that success
in life is more than just

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
about success in business
and that we have the ability

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
to create success on our own
terms if we believe we can?

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:84%
When we look ahead and we
step into that future version

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, we
think of ourselves

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
in that dream house
with our dream partner.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
But when we do that,
we can see a gap.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And that gap can lead us back
to a place of contraction.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when we see that gap,
a small part of our brain

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:90%
called the amygdala fires.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And when that
little peanut fires,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
you lose all sense
of creativity,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and you go back to
that contracted state,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and you carry on the hamster
wheel and the relentless will

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:90%
of rush and grind and hustle.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
But I believe there's
a smarter way.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:84%
And research shows that when
we ask the question, what if?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
This engages our
prefrontal cortex

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and allows us to
be creative again,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
allows us to step into
our goals and dreams.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
When I first started
out on my journey,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I got into the
world of biohacking.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, so much of
it was masculine in nature.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It was, again, more stress on
my female body, cold showers,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
long, fast,
high-intensity workouts,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
which were too much for my
already burnt out adrenals.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And so, I started
syncing, or what

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I like to call biosyncing,
biosyncing with my bio

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
individuality, syncing
with my female physiology,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:84%
syncing with that
future version of me.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:84%
What's right for me may
not be right for you.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Research from McKinsey
shows us that when

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.420 align:middle line:84%
we access a flow state, we are
five times more productive.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
That means if you can
access flow, ladies,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
you can go to work on a Monday
and take the rest of the week

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But the best time for
you to achieve flow

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.640 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily
the same time as me.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
For me, it could be
early in the morning.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
For you, it could
be late at night.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we need to sync
with our bio individuality

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.980 align:middle line:84%
so that we can achieve a state
of health and high performance

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
without sacrificing our
physical, mental, and spiritual

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:84%
When we start to sync
with our female physiology

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:84%
and design our nutrition, our
fitness, and our creativity

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.010 align:middle line:84%
around our femininity,
embracing the wonder

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:84%
of the menstrual cycle,
we become more in tune

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
with our rhythms, and we can get
there faster so that you don't

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:84%
just feel good for two
weeks out of every month,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.950 align:middle line:84%
but you feel good
every single day.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
When we start to sync
with our future self,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.200 align:middle line:84%
we can create an
empowering future.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't let the
past create our future.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.430 align:middle line:84%
We want our future
to define our present

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:84%
and use our present
to reframe our past.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And it all starts
with a question.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you,
what if everything

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:84%
you've experienced to date has
been leading up to this point?

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
It is said that the
bigger the contraction,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:90%
the bigger the expansion.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
What if everything was
happening for you so that you

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:90%
could get to this point?

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.995 align:middle line:84%
And it all begins with a
simple question, what if?

00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
My hope is that my
experience and my journey

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:84%
will inspire you to ask
that question, what if?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And that you can start
biosyncing and begin

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.850 align:middle line:84%
to give your dreams wings so
that like a butterfly coming out

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
of the cocoon, you
can start to fly.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And that together, we can
inspire and empower women

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
across the world and create
a ripple effect together.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for listening.
