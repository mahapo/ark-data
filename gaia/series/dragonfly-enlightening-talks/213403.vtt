[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:13.203 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.203 --> 00:00:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I am so happy to be here
because I love discomfort,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.050 align:middle line:90%
so I am right at home.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:10%
In my early 30s, I was
diagnosed with three autoimmune

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.730 align:middle line:10%
conditions--

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:10%
Hashimoto's thyroiditis,
eosinophilic esophagitis,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:10%
and urticaria.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:10%
They didn't give me the
dictionary on these words

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:10%
or how to figure them out.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And in my journey,
getting these diagnoses,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
going through our modern
health care system,

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I kept stacking
prescription medications

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:90%
on my bed stand table.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And the more years went by,
the more specialists were added

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to my repertoire, the
more vitamins, pills,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and supplements were
added to my nightstand.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't getting better.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that I was doing
in the medical system

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.350 align:middle line:90%
was helping me get well.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:90%
And I tried alternative healing.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:90%
I tried the acupuncture.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I tried the herbal remedies.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:90%
I tried everything.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And things weren't working.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was at my wits end.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I was tired of being tired.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I was tired of being sick.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I was tired of saying
no to every opportunity

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:84%
in life because I didn't
have the energy to show up.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:90%
So I'm an avid reader.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading all kinds
of books, fiction, nonfiction.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And the nonfiction, I'm
reading about Nassim Taleb

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:84%
in "Antifragile" and his
practice in deliberate cold

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:84%
exposure, Aubrey
Marcus, "Own the Day."

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
talking about it.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And then in the fiction
sense, Steinbeck, Hemingway.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you know they also
practiced cold exposure just

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:90%
instinctually?

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And so here I was
at my wits end,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.270 align:middle line:84%
not finding the
answers that I was

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
looking for in the
modern medical system.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm finding all
these little seeds

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:90%
being planted about Adrian--

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.120 align:middle line:90%
just take an ice bath.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:90%
I think I'd rather not.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Florida.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:90%
I lived in Hawaii.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I spent the last 20 years
in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And if I could make that
summertime last all year round,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:90%
I would.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:90%
But I can't.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So begrudgingly, I drag
a big ol' horse trough

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:90%
into the backyard.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Got a few hundred pounds of ice.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Did this wild,
hyperventilate, holotropic,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
hyperactive breathwork-- you
all probably know the one--

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:90%
to prepare me for this ice bath.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.375 align:middle line:90%
So did my 30 minutes of--

00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:03.057 align:middle line:90%
[PANTING]

00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I walk over
to that ice bath.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And I have to be
first because I'm not

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
going to watch anyone else
do this before I do this.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And I put one foot on each side
and I put one hand on each side.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And I drop myself
into this ice water.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.370 align:middle line:90%
And I held my breath.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that
lasted nine seconds.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And then I leapt out.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:90%
And I freaked out.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And two things
happened right away.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
That guaranteed I would take
another ice bath, not that day.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing
that I noticed

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
was the chronic pain
in my legs that I'd

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:84%
had for 10 years that had no
diagnosis was completely gone.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
That relief alone was going
to get me back in the cold.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that I noticed
was a sense of empowerment

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
like I had never
felt in my life.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:90%
Like, I am a sick person.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:90%
I am a chronically ill person.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:90%
I am overweight.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I am depressed.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:90%
I am unhappy.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:90%
And I did this.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:90%
I am a sunshine girl.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:90%
And I did this.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Go me.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I got to my
third or fourth ice bath,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing in front
of it, ready to do

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, my hyperactive
holotropic breathwork,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and then drop myself
violently into the water

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:90%
because I can beat this.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:90%
No, no, we cannot beat the cold.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.728 align:middle line:84%
And it's my third
or fourth ice bath.

00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing in
front of the ice water.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm staring at it.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And I cannot move.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I was in my own freeze response
before I ever even got cold.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I
was creating all

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.930 align:middle line:84%
of this hyperactive energy
around this challenging

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.340 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we meet the
stressors in life,

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.580 align:middle line:84%
we don't benefit by being
reactive to those stressors,

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:84%
by meeting them with more
aggression and stress.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
We benefit by pausing,
evaluating, reflecting and then

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:90%
responding from a calm place.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm standing there
staring at the water,

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:84%
knowing that all I have to
do is get to the other side

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the feel good is.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, how am I
going to do this?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to do this?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrified.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I was more scared by that
third or fourth ice bath

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:90%
than I was from the first.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized I had
to draw on my experiences

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
in life that helped bring me out
of this anxious state of mind

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:90%
and into my body.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And how do I do that?

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit of yoga nidra.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I feel my feet firm on
the ground beneath me.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I can allow my hands and arms
to hang loose by my side.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:90%
I can breathe into my belly.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Instead of my chest,

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I can activate my
physical senses.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:90%
What can I hear?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Smell, see, taste and touch.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And by bringing myself
into my physical body,

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing myself out
of this anxious headspace.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first time
that I stepped intentionally

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:30.050 align:middle line:84%
with full, deliberate
intention into an ice bath.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And I put both feet on
the bottom of the tub.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down
without hesitation.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:90%
And I leaned back.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And I breathe deep into my
belly as slow as I could.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there for 2
minutes, and then I got out.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:90%
And I did not freak out.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And I got more
from that ice bath

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
than I had the combination
of the ones leading up

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.400 align:middle line:90%
to it because I chose calm.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:90%
And we all have this choice.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.835 align:middle line:84%
We all have the
choice to choose calm.

00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Practicing in the ice bath
is this safe environment

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:84%
that creates this
fight-or-flight response

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and gives me the
opportunity to practice

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
how am I going to respond
to that stress response.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And so each time I take
an ice bath, I step out,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:90%
I feel like a whole new person.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm now going days without
the chronic pain in my legs.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I've got energy to make
it through a whole day.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling great.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I was telling anyone
who would listen,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:84%
do you know what I
just figured out?

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.290 align:middle line:90%
The cold.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I started guiding
other people using

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.900 align:middle line:84%
my own idea, my own technique of
how to get through this stress

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
By August of 2019, less than
two years from my very first ice

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
bath, I reversed all traits
of autoimmune in my system.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I spent over a year weaning off
every prescription medication.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
When I went in for my labs
to my endocrinologist,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't tell her.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Just had to read my labs.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:90%
She says, Adrian, this is great.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Everything's within range.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:84%
I want you to keep
doing what you're doing.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, cool.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm taking ice baths.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:90%
She's like, great.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:90%
This is fantastic.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:90%
She writes it down in my file.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.528 align:middle line:84%
She says, I hope I never
have to see you again.

00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
yeah, me too, me too,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:84%
until I walked out
in the waiting room.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a dozen other people,
overweight, overmedicated

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:90%
stuck in the system.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And do you think
that she was going

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:84%
to tell any one of those
people that I just did

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:84%
the miracle of all
miracles and reversed all

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
trace of autoimmune
this chronic illness

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:90%
that there was no cure for?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.230 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So since that day
in August 2019,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
I have taken it upon myself
not only to share the healing

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
benefits of the cold with
anyone who is willing to listen

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and some who are not and also
to develop the Morozko method

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
technique, a sensory-immersive
mindful meditation

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
to help you move through
the stress response

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:90%
with a calm mindset.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.920 align:middle line:84%
When you learn this in the
ice, you learn it in life.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I now work closely with
veterans, first responders,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
sober living
facilities, and everyone

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:84%
who is interested in taking
the power of their own healing

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.240 align:middle line:90%
into their own hands.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I stand before you today
not because I like the cold.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:90%
I do love what it does for me.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.240 align:middle line:90%
