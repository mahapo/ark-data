00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:08.730 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.245 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.840 align:middle line:10%
>> My dad always used to say,
if you don't know what you

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.230 align:middle line:10%
don't know, you won't
know till you find out.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.840 align:middle line:10%
And self-awareness
is a lot like that.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.940 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing quite
like waking up in a ditch

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:84%
on the side of the road, soaking
wet from a tropical rainstorm,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.770 align:middle line:84%
dead cell phone in hand,
not a soul in sight.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:84%
I was in my early
20s, and I thought,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:84%
something's got to change,
something I felt off in my life

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time, something
I couldn't quite put my finger

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
People kept telling me I had
everything I needed to succeed.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:90%
So why did I keep failing?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It was as if I had become my
own worst enemy, mistakenly

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.095 align:middle line:90%
and unknowingly.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:84%
My friends knew it that
day when they scooped me up

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:84%
off the side of the
road, and they told me

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:90%
I needed to get some help.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I was not one to
readily receive help,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:84%
but ironically
enough, I was studying

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:90%
to be a therapist at that time.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So for the sake of my career
and the sake of my sanity,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I decided to go to therapy
for the first time.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
While in therapy, through the
diagnostic lens of my therapist,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I became aware of three things.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
I became aware that my
childhood was not normal,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:90%
even if it was normal to me.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I became aware of
the fact that I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
had something called a
dissociative disorder, where

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
stimuli in my environment
would cause me

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:90%
to check out and leave my body.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And I became aware
that I had something

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
called PTSD, a
diagnosis that would

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.030 align:middle line:84%
make it 50% more likely that
I would experience trauma

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:90%
again later in life.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't stay on my
self-awareness path,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
I would continue to
repeat the patterns that

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:90%
clearly weren't working.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So I figured I should start
by getting to know myself.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I kicked off
Operation Fix Myself

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
because I thought something
was wrong with me,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to learn how
to be my own best friend.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Receiving a trauma
diagnosis was kind

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.623 align:middle line:84%
of like getting a
key to a locked door,

00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
but I want to know what was
on the other side of the door.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of questions.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
I thought of trauma
as being something

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that had happened
to me in the past,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
not something that
was continuing

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:90%
to happen inside of me.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.457 align:middle line:84%
So I figured I should start by
trying to catch my dissociation.

00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The first time I caught
it, a friend of mine

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%
was expressing a ton of anger,
and he was very intense,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed myself
closing off very subtly.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
intuitively, I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
thought, what if I
just shifted my body?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I was able
to stay in my body.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that his
anger triggered my shutdown,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:90%
and I could be aware of it.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I learned that the
word "interoception"

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
means to feel internally
what's going on.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So I started practicing
interoception everywhere

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I went--

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
at the gym, eating food,
checking people's vibes.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I tried all my senses
differently too,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
which allowed me to stay
grounded inside myself, which

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
allowed me to learn
more about myself,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
peeling back layer
after layer after layer.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:90%
But I still had questions.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
What would cause my
mind to leave my body?

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Did this happen to other people?

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Did it change the
trajectory of my life?

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Could I change my
PTSD diagnosis,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:90%
or was I stuck with it forever?

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:84%
It took me six universities, a
mental health counseling degree,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and 12 years of
self-awareness work

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the
answer to my questions

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.490 align:middle line:90%
resided in my nervous system.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I spent the last three
years understanding

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:84%
why the nervous system
is the core integration

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:90%
tool to your self-awareness.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think of when
you think of the nervous system?

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Most people think of
an anatomy textbook.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.033 align:middle line:84%
They think of a brain and all
the squiggly lines for nerves.

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And really, we think
that because that's

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.870 align:middle line:90%
all we've ever been shown.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the hardware
of the nervous system.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But the software is the energy,
the feelings, the sensations,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:90%
the intuition that comes up.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.980 align:middle line:84%
That creates an infinite
loop between your internal

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and your external experience.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.160 align:middle line:84%
The software and the
hardware combined

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
create a processing
mechanism for you

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:90%
to interact in your world.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.682 align:middle line:84%
Self-awareness is a nervous
system software update.

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't walk around
with an outdated cell phone.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't even think the tech
companies would allow you

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:90%
if you tried.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't you update
the software in your body?

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to feel the
way you've been conditioned

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:90%
to feel in your life.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to help people
live more embodied lives so they

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:84%
can shift into alignment
with themselves

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and think differently about
the way that they feel.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:90%
The nervous system is always on.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:90%
If it wasn't, you'd be dead.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:90%
And we all have one.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It was conditioned
at a time and place

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:84%
where you had absolutely no
control over what impacted it

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:90%
or why.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And now, as adults, we
walk around in our lives

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle line:84%
with very minimal
awareness of the reactivity

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.900 align:middle line:84%
We're not aware of how
our conditioning impacts

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.700 align:middle line:90%
our everyday lives.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we avoid it or, I
said, live in reactivity to it.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you can bring
awareness to it,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:84%
you can embody your
experience, and you

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.175 align:middle line:84%
can cultivate the self-awareness
you need to make those changes.

00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Most people, when they
think of the nervous system,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:84%
they think of it as
being either on or off.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:84%
You might be familiar with
the words "fight or flight."

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
But there are actually six
different nervous system states.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Three are primary, and
three are combinations

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:90%
of those primary states.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever mixed pink
and yellow to get orange?

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:10%
The nervous system
mixes fight or flight

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:10%
with warmth and compassion
to get the sensation of play.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Each nervous system state
has a biological cascade

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that changes the
neurotransmission, blood flow,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
hormone release, and other
bodily functions related

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
to what we feel motivated to
do at any given moment in time.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:84%
If one of those biological
cascades stays on for too long,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.255 align:middle line:90%
that cascade gets wired.

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:10%
And this is what
we think of when

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:10%
we see stress is causing heart
attacks in men or burnout

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:10%
in women.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But the bad feelings
aren't always

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.070 align:middle line:84%
bad if we know how
to move through them.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, you don't
have to feel the way you've

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:90%
been conditioned to feel.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I told people in
my career a really long time

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
that feelings aren't
controllable directly

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:84%
by free will, and I'm beginning
to think that I was wrong.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think that,
with this awareness,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
you can shift the
way that you feel.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:84%
When I ask clients after
years of working with hundreds

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
of clients what their
goals are, they usually

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:84%
say they want to
be happy, right?

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
They say that they don't know
how to feel their feelings,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:84%
that they fear their
feelings, that they

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be controlled
by their feelings,

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:84%
but they want to feel
more of a feeling.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
But I'm starting to wonder if
what if by happy, what they

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
actually mean is that
they want to feel calm.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:84%
They want to feel safe and know
they can respond to a threat

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.290 align:middle line:90%
if it arises.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the world
needs more of that.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I think the world needs
more embodied awareness

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:90%
of their nervous system.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
I think that if we can
change the way we think

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
about our feelings, we might
feel like we can do something

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:90%
about our feelings.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:84%
What would change
in your life if you

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:84%
felt like you could do something
about the way you feel?

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
What if making that change is
rooted in your nervous system

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:90%
and self-awareness?

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And what if changing
as individuals

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.620 align:middle line:84%
helps us change as
a whole in society?

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:18.550 align:middle line:84%
What if we were able to have
more connection, less division,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:84%
more embodiment, less
dissociation, more resilience,

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.970 align:middle line:90%
less reactivity?

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Would we live in a happier
and healthier world for all?

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
