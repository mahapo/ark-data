00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:08.910 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever been handed
a pamphlet for a medication

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.570 align:middle line:90%
that's supposed to help you?

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.120 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to do
really great things.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Then you turn it over, and
there are the side effects.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:10%
I will never forget the moment--

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:10%
I am 26 years old,
just a baby, sitting

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:10%
in my orthopedics' office
reading those side effects.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
After 20 years of intense
competitive gymnastics,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I found myself no longer able to
do most of the things I loved--

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
hiking, biking, yoga,
sleep, all off the table.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
At this point, even though I
had become a successful coach,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was empowering
others to find their health

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and well-being, I struggled
most of my life with my health.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It started at nine with
unidentifiable gut issues,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and then it just snowballed
downhill from there--

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:84%
PCOS, anorexia, bulimia,
anxiety, depression,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:84%
chronic fatigue, chronic
pain, migraines, brain fog,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.360 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:84%
It was a wonder I
was even functioning.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
I woke up at 23 years
old, 75 pounds overweight,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:84%
even though I was a
competitive athlete,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
training for at
least two hours a day

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and eating all the
supposed right things.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.355 align:middle line:90%
So how did I get there?

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.320 align:middle line:84%
By the time this final
wake-up call came,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I had already tried it all--

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:84%
the saunas, the deep
detoxes, the cold plunges,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:90%
the fancy supplements.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I had exhausted what I
thought was every resource.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:90%
I had some successes.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
I definitely overcame
some chronic issues.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But there I sat,
at 26 years old,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.870 align:middle line:84%
listening to my orthopedic tell
me that you should just never

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.460 align:middle line:90%
run again.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
How had I worked so hard
doing all the right things,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:90%
to find myself in that position?

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Would I ever get past the
dysfunction and the pain?

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of you can
identify with this.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
You've struggled with
endless health issues.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
You've exhausted
all your resources.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:84%
You take a couple steps
forward to eventually fall

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:90%
backwards again.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
I left the office that day,
devastated and hopeless.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:84%
After crying my eyes out
and processing my upset,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I found myself exhausted
and completely empty.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And in that emptiness,
I knew those toxic side

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:90%
effects were not for me.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I knew deep down,
there had to be a way

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to reactivate my original
blueprint of health

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:90%
We all have one.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Mine had to be in
there somewhere.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So I gathered up my
courage once again,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
and I went forward determined
to find a solution.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
After a few more years of
searching, experimenting--

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:84%
yes, I am a walking experiment,
just as many of you might be--

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and living in a completely
dysfunctional body,

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to
the world of fascia

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and the nervous system, what
I like to call the roots.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
After many years of
trying to describe fascia,

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I like to compare it
to the roots of a tree.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:90%
The roots run really deep.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:84%
They permeate anything
and everything

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:90%
that stands in their way.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
They are not uniform.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
They provide nourishment,
stability, and communication.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.430 align:middle line:84%
They are part of an innate
primal warning system when

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:90%
there is an imminent threat.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
Without the roots, a tree
couldn't survive, let alone

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:90%
stand.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, without
our fascial matrix,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
our bodies simply
would not work.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Our incredible bodies have 78
organs, 206 bones, 600 muscles,

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
60,000 miles of blood vessels,
and trillions of nerves.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Fascia is the system
of all these systems

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:84%
that allows everything
to communicate and work

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.450 align:middle line:84%
together so that we can actually
function as a whole living

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:90%
organism.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It is the master operating
system of our bodies.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Fascia is wrapped
around, embedded

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:84%
into and throughout every
single tissue in our body,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
including the blood vessels,
including the nerves,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:84%
including the organs, all
the way down to the tiny cell

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Fascia has no beginning
or end in the system.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like a figure eight
running throughout your body.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
It is the very
first tissue to form

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:84%
when we are in
utero, which is part

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:84%
of the reason it is
so intimately linked

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:90%
with our nervous system.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Fascia holds our
memories and influences

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
like snapshots, which makes it a
blueprint of where we came from

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and everything that's
happened along the way.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Yes, our body does keep
score, and it does so

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:90%
via the fascial tissue.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might be wondering,
why does this matter.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to balancing
my hormones, building muscle,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
or whatever goal you
might have for yourself.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fascial matrix
has three primary functions.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it is a high-speed
communication network.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the internet
running throughout your body,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
allowing all those cells and
pieces and parts to communicate.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Number two, which is very
little known to a lot of people,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:90%
it is a fluid delivery system.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:90%
We are 90% fluid.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Fascia functions like a
pump, pumping this fluid

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:90%
throughout our system.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It delivers essential
substances to cells,

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
so that the cells can
do what the cells know

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:84%
how to do, while removing that
cellular waste at the same time.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Number three, maybe
its simplest activity,

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
is that it gives us
structure, form, and support.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have fascia,
we couldn't stand.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't move.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.908 align:middle line:84%
We would literally be limp
sacks of tissue and bone.

00:07:09.908 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, the most important
thing that I'm here

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
to talk about today
is the intimate link

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
between the fascial system
and the nervous system.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Combined, these two systems
impact every single function

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:84%
in your body, meaning
whatever is going on

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
in your nervous system is
being directly communicated

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to every single cell in your
body via the fascial tissue.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side of
it, whatever is impacting

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
your fascial tissue is
impacting your nervous system

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to
regulate itself.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what
your goal might be,

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.120 align:middle line:84%
every health journey
begins with learning

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:84%
to understand and nourish
the fascial nervous system.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I began to learn about
fascia and the many impactors

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that impact its performance
and how it operates,

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I quickly learned what
my main impactors were.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
You see repetitive movements,
poor posture, injuries,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
surgeries, create something
in the fascial tissue

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:90%
called adhesions.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that those
roots of the tree

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:84%
are so entangled and tight
that the information can't get

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:90%
through in either direction.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So when we have these adhesions
in the fascial tissue throughout

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:84%
our system, the area around
that adhesion-- the cells,

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:90%
the tissues--

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:84%
cannot function
optimally, if at all.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So it was no coincidence
that I struggled

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:84%
with liver and gallbladder
issues most of my life.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And I had also broken my ribs
multiple times on my right side.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
There was also no coincidence
that I struggled with my thyroid

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:90%
most of my life.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have had countless
whiplashes, concussions,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:90%
and neck injuries.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.520 align:middle line:84%
My gymnastics career had
impacted my fascial system

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.650 align:middle line:84%
so deeply at a visceral
organ level that I couldn't

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:84%
get beyond my
challenges, no matter

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:84%
how many deep detoxes I did or
fancy supplements I threw down

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:90%
my throat.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:90%
And there were a lot.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, my biggest impactor of all
that was totally under my radar

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:90%
was my chronic stress response.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
You see, I grew up thinking that
being hypervigilant and anxious

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:84%
all the time just meant that
I was really productive.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:84%
The sad thing was that I grew
up in an abusive, toxic, unsafe

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:84%
My body never knew
rest and digest.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:90%
I grew up running from a tiger.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So as I got older, this
chronic stress response

00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
was undermining every attempt
I made to be healthy and whole.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The scariest part about
this was that I didn't even

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:90%
know I was in fight or flight.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:84%
I had completely normalized
this way of being, just as many

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:90%
of you might be doing right now.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:84%
In today's stress-filled
modern world,

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
this stress pandemic
has become so insidious

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that we have completely
normalized a way of being

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:90%
that is completely abnormal.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, the issue with this
normalization is that our body

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:90%
cannot regulate itself.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It cannot heal and repair
when we are in a chronic state

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.910 align:middle line:90%
of fight or flight.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Survival mode means
exactly that--

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:90%
survive, not thrive.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to learn
to nourish your roots.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
With the information we have
about our fascial system

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and how it impacts every cell,
every tissue in our body,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
especially when combined
with our nervous system,

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
we now have a proactive
and responsive way

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
of treating the cause
rather than to continue

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:90%
to chase those symptoms.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Learn to care for your fascial
matrix and your nervous system

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and take control of your health
and well-being once and for all.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
