00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.432 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:12.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Ladies and
gentlemen, Namaste.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.030 align:middle line:10%
My name is Megha and I
am from India in case

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:10%
it's not clear already.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And I create magic.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might wonder,
wow, that's a gutsy thing

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:90%
to come and say.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a daring thing to
come on stage and say.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.080 align:middle line:90%
She creates magic.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Who the hell is she?

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't always like this.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, just this
morning, I have woken up

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:90%
and cried my eyes out.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And not because I was
going to come on stage,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
but because last night, I had
a severe case of hypoglycemia.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And hypoglycemia is basically
an attack of low blood glucose.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And that was scary, and I
like, "What am I doing here?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.975 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Why did I get that attack?"

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I started playing
victim in my head.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Let me flash back.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Like Katie said, I am a
holistic biohacker from India,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:84%
but I'm an actor as well, so I
will use words like "flashback"

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:90%
and "cut" and "action."

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So seven years ago,
I lost my father.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:10%
It was way overnight.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:90%
He was with us.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
He was eating, drinking, being
with us in the swimming pool.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
He went out for
dinner with friends.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And by night, he vomited
blood and he was gone.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, that came as
a very, very rude shock to us

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:90%
as a family.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.970 align:middle line:10%
And just when we had finished
his rituals four months later,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:10%
my mother got diagnosed
with breast cancer Stage II.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:84%
My parents were and are
my favorite love story.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I feel in her case, the
pain manifested in her chest

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
and led to breast
cancer stage II.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
That, combined with a very
difficult marriage, which

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.166 align:middle line:84%
maybe some of you
relate to, I don't know,

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
was a cocktail for or
a recipe for disaster.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:84%
My pancreas gave up on
me handling everything.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:90%
It affected my solar plexus.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And the day the doctor gave
my mother a green signal

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
that she was cancer-free is the
day she looked at me and said,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:90%
you're diabetic.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Nobody-- I kid you not.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Nobody from my mother's
side, about 50 people,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
or from my father's side, about
50 people again, is diabetic.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I do not blame it on my
genes or my lifestyle.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I was always into a
healthy lifestyle,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
whatever that was
for me at that point.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't because
I was obese or unfit

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.550 align:middle line:90%
or because of lifestyle choices.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:90%
It was chronic stress.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:90%
It was chronic stress.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.240 align:middle line:90%
And that was scary.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I do not know so many
things that I know now.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I decided to leave Mumbai,
a prominent city in India,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and all the hustle, bustle
of it, and move to Goa,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
and change my lifestyle,
got into biohacking.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And I now know things
that I did not know then.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I wish someone had
come and told me

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:90%
what I'm going to tell you now.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I heard a lot of podcasts, did
a lot of conferences, retreats,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
books, and I've come up
with this protocol, which

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share with you
so that you busy people don't

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:90%
have to do the work that I did.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Earthing, your
connection with the soil.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
When you're connected
with the soil,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.780 align:middle line:84%
you're connected with
yourself, with others,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and it's very healing.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Journaling.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I cannot insist on the
benefits of journaling enough.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:84%
When you put it on paper,
you release it and you

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
let the power of your words,
your thoughts, just go away.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:84%
It's also magical because the
minute you put it on paper,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:84%
it manifests and your
intentions come true.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely no force
on this planet that cannot--

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:84%
that will come in the
way of your manifestation

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:90%
if you journal.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Intuition.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
My God, we women have the
power of intuition, don't we?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
We just don't use it enough.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:90%
We just don't believe in it.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:90%
I see you smiling.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.967 align:middle line:90%
We just don't believe in it.

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
We're like, no,
that can't be true.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:90%
But trust your gut.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It is when God is
talking to you.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to
God, it's a prayer.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But when God talks to
you, that's intuition.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:90%
So trust your gut instinct.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorites,
forgiveness.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:84%
We find it so
difficult to forgive.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Forgive yourself for what
you could or couldn't do.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Forgive others for
what they did to you.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Ask for forgiveness from others.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Release yourself.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Holding on to grudges is like
drinking poison and thinking

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
the other person
is going to suffer.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.175 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Intuition, journaling, thoughts.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Your thoughts.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Your thoughts are seeds.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Your mitochondria is
listening to everything.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you something.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
When I got diagnosed
with type I diabetes,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I had this pain in my right
palm, on the end of my fingers,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
at the nerve endings,
and I couldn't

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:84%
understand why it was happening
only in my right hand.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Why only the right hand?

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
For days, I would
wake up in the middle

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.913 align:middle line:84%
of the night with so much
pain in my right hand.

00:05:48.913 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't understand.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Why right?

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Why right?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.995 align:middle line:90%
I kept asking myself.

00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Many days later, it came to me--

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I have actually never
appreciated my right hand.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was like
pudgy, a little more fatter, not

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:90%
beautiful like my left hand.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, it really happened.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I just thought they
were like pudgy fingers.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
damn, I am so sorry.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.150 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I'm like, I'm so
sorry I thought like that,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:90%
that I thought you were pudgy.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And you're my
gateway to the world.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:90%
You're what I sign with.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.610 align:middle line:90%
You're what I shake hands with.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:90%
You're what I wave with.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so sorry for
thinking like that.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm so sorry I did that to you.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to report that the
pain stopped the very next day.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.070 align:middle line:84%
The power of thought is
so strong it can heal you.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So please, be very mindful of
the thoughts that you're having.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is
listening to it.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Last but not least, be
so gentle with yourself.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Be so healthy to yourself.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:90%
It's so important.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Honor yourself.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Spend time with yourself.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll agree with
me, women on this planet

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:90%
can do everything, right?

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Women on this planet
can do everything,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:90%
but just not for everybody.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.160 align:middle line:90%
So hold that thought.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Keep that in your mind.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
There's only so
much time I have.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:90%
And India is a vast country.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
healing modalities,

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
but I can't bring
them here to you.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:90%
So I hope this helps.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:90%
And thank you very much.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Namaste

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:90%
