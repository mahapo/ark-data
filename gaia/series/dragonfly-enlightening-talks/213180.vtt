00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:12.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.610 align:middle line:10%
>> All right, what if I told you
that inside your body there is

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:10%
a secret weapon that can help
you to age like Benjamin Button.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Would you believe me?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Look.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense, right?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Your body is regenerating
and repairing itself

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The body is nothing if it's
not an incredible machine that

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
can restore and
regenerate on the fly.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, we
overwhelm the system.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And over time, and
with the years,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:90%
those systems can start to fail.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:10%
But have you ever
thought about how,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:10%
right now, as you're sitting
there, you're healing,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:10%
you're regenerating?

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:10%
Everything is moving
in your system.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:10%
Today, I'm going to talk to you
about a body of research that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.514 align:middle line:10%
is four decades old
that not only confirms

00:01:03.514 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:10%
that that system exists,
but that it can possibly

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.280 align:middle line:10%
be reengaged and reignited
so that we can live longer,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:10%
healthier lives.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can even get
younger as we get older.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
About 40 years ago,
Russian military brass

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
approached a young doctor by
the name of Vladimir Khavinson,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
a young corporal medical
doctor in the army,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:90%
and gave him a mission.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And his mission was, we
want you to develop a system

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to heal and regenerate our
soldiers who are coming back

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.230 align:middle line:84%
from space and coming back from
nuclear submarine missions,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
depleted and aging
before their time.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you even imagine
that conversation?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the good news is, they
gave him unlimited resources.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:90%
He had all the budget he needed.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:90%
He had labs.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.330 align:middle line:90%
He had animals.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.940 align:middle line:84%
They even said to him, we have
factories filled with workers.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And when it's time, you can
even test your technology

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:90%
on the workers.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:90%
And so off he went.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:10%
And maybe he was
looking for technology.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
But what he found were
these tiny little proteins

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be present
in every life form

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that he studied, from bacteria
to animals to plants, even

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:90%
humans.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:84%
And these tiny little proteins,
just two to four amino acids

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:84%
long, he named
bioregulator peptides.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle line:10%
What bioregulator peptides
can do is get into the cell,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:10%
get into the nucleus of
the cell, bind to DNA,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:10%
and upregulate the
production of proteins

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:10%
that help to regenerate
and restore function

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:10%
to tissues, glands, and organs.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.240 align:middle line:90%
This was quite a discovery.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So there are 21
bioregulator peptides

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
that are commercially
available today.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
Khavinson bioregulator

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
peptides, of course,
after Dr. Khavinson,

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.110 align:middle line:84%
who is now Professor Khavinson
and the head of the Saint

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Petersburg Institute
of Gerontology and--

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:90%
what else-- bioregulation.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So these 21 bioregulator
peptides, every one of them

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
lines up with a tissue,
gland, or organ in our body.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:84%
They originally are sourced
from tissues, glands,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:90%
and organs of animals.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
They can be accessed
as oral capsules, which

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:90%
are nutritional supplements.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Or that bioregulator
peptide itself

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
can be isolated and
resynthesized in a lab,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and then it can be
reintroduced into the body

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:84%
as a sublingual drop,
sublingual spray,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:90%
or a subcutaneous injection.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Lots of subs.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.430 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Anyway, back to
our bioregulator peptides.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to share
with you about two

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:90%
of my favorite bioregulators.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.338 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I can't
go through all 21.

00:03:45.338 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little bit like
picking your favorite child,

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
but I'm not that good at that.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, my desert island
bioregulator peptide

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
is the one that maybe
you've heard of.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.250 align:middle line:90%
It's called epitalon.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the pineal gland regulator.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland, that tiny
little gland in your brain,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:90%
is capable of magical things.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It can activate
telomerase, which

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is the enzyme that helps
to restore and lengthen

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:84%
the telomeres on the
ends of your DNA.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
It can help to restore
normal and youthful melatonin

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:90%
levels in older adults.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And older, in this case, is
anybody over the age of 45

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
when our melatonin
levels start to dive.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland also is
the master hormone endocrine

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:90%
regulator of the body.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
So it can help to bring
harmony back to the hormones.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
It also helps to reset
circadian rhythm.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And finally, this
bioregulator peptide

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.540 align:middle line:84%
can have amazing benefits
for the immune system,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:84%
to the point where some
of Khavinson's research

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
even shows that it has
anticancer and antitumor

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:90%
benefits.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
My next choice is the
thymus gland bioregulator.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Thymus gland lives in
the center of your chest.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.900 align:middle line:90%
It is the seat of your immunity.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
our thymus gland

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.418 align:middle line:84%
starts to involute
very early in the game.

00:05:00.418 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And if there's one
thing that's going

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
to take us out of
this world, it's

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:90%
a dysfunctional immune system.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So anything we can do to
restore function and vitality

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:84%
to our immune system
through our thymus gland

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.615 align:middle line:84%
is going to put
us in good shape.

00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk a little
bit about the research.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.365 align:middle line:84%
Because you're all
looking at me going,

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:90%
yeah, that's all great theory.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:90%
But where are the goods?

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So there are hundreds of
published studies on PubMed.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is, a lot
of them are in Russian.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The good news is, a bunch of
them have been translated.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So two really key studies
that Khavinson really--

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that make an impact on people
are the old people study,

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:90%
and the elderly people study.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:90%
I didn't name them.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.970 align:middle line:84%
The old people study, 60 to
74-year-olds, 12-year study.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.760 align:middle line:84%
One group was given poly
vitamins for two years,

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and the other group was given
pineal gland bioregulator

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:90%
injections for two years.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
At the end of six years,
13.5% of the control group

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.650 align:middle line:90%
had passed away.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Only 8% of the test
subjects had passed away.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But after 12 years, we had 44%
of the control group was gone,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
only 22% of the pineal
gland group was gone.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:90%
That's a 50% reduction.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty impressive.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.410 align:middle line:90%
So he decided to up the ante.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:84%
He now went into
elderly populations.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So now we're looking at
75 to 89-year-old people.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%
He had three groups this time.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.857 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're going
to understand why I also

00:06:23.857 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:90%
picked those two peptides.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
The first group is
our control group.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.352 align:middle line:84%
They got their poly
vitamin injections.

00:06:28.352 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew what
they were getting.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.660 align:middle line:84%
The second group got
pineal gland injections.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
The third group got pineal
gland and thymus gland.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the six years, 80%
of the control group were gone.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
45% of the pineal
gland group were gone.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Only 33% of the people who
had pineal gland and thymus

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
gland by bioregulator
had passed away.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:90%
So we're on to something.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we can
keep old people alive.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.780 align:middle line:90%
What about the rest of us?

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is, there's a
ton of research talking about--

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
from everywhere from athletes
to people with illness.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.680 align:middle line:10%
What's amazing about
bioregulator peptides

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:10%
is not only can they
help to optimize,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:10%
but they also work really
well with medication.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:10%
They play beautifully
with medication.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.880 align:middle line:10%
In the studies where they will
bring together bioregulators

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.460 align:middle line:10%
with medication, very
often, the people

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.220 align:middle line:10%
will actually have faster
results, better results,

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:10%
and they will last longer.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And it makes sense.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if the medication is
helping with the symptoms,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and the bioregulator is helping
to regenerate, and renew,

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.868 align:middle line:84%
and restore, then
we can hope that,

00:07:32.868 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
basically, we're going to
be able to move forward

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:90%
in a better way.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
All right, so in
my time remaining,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.597 align:middle line:84%
what am I going
to share with you?

00:07:39.597 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So today, the
budgets aren't there.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
He no longer has the
labs and the lab animals,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.260 align:middle line:90%
and everything paid for.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So he's partnered with
an American researcher

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Bill Lawrence.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing a
four-year clinical trial

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
looking to see if
regulator peptides can

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:90%
help to reverse biological age.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:84%
The two metrics
that they're using

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.020 align:middle line:84%
are telomere length
and DNA methylation.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And after four
years, I can tell you

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
that on the telomere
length studies,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:90%
the results are amazing.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.520 align:middle line:84%
20 to 30 years age reversal
in most of the subjects.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Some people don't see much.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And what do you want to
guess is the reason why?

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The biggest impact
is chronic stress.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the DNA
methylation side,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that data is not published
yet, but the initial data

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.470 align:middle line:84%
showed that after just two
years of bioregulator peptides,

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
on average, people who
were taking the regulators

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:84%
were five years younger
than their biological age

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.030 align:middle line:84%
versus people who weren't,
who were about two years older

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:90%
than their biological age.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Now these people,
including yours truly,

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
are pounding the bioregulators.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
We're using the oral
bioregulators month after month

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:90%
after month after month.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:90%
So I see raised eyebrows.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Sounds pretty
magical, doesn't it?

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:90%
So here's the bad news.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Not a silver bullet.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember
about the basics.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Bring bioregulators
into a house that's

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
on fire with
inflammation, they're

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:90%
probably going to burn out.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Introduced by regulators
into a terrain that's

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
depleted and toxic, they
may send the signals,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:90%
but not much is going to happen.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember to
take care of the basics.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And to make sure that
we remember these

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
are an incredible tool, but they
are just a piece of the puzzle.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Having said that,
how incredible is

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
it that one of the keys
to longevity and vitality

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.970 align:middle line:84%
is coming to us straight out
of mother nature's playbook?

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for your attention.
