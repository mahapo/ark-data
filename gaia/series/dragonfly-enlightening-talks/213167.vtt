00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It's so nice to be here on stage
with all these beautiful women.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:10%
So I want to start today by just
sharing with you how I got here

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.080 align:middle line:10%
on this stage, sharing with
all these amazing doctors

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.550 align:middle line:10%
and personalities.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So my journey to health
started with a personal crisis,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
like for many women
that have shared here

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:84%
or you probably have
heard stories of.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I was born and raised
in the Soviet Union.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And my family had
nuclear engineers,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
as that's who was in my
family, nuclear engineers.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up around all
sorts of nuclear sites--

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
submarines, nuclear
icebreakers, nuclear facilities.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:90%
Guess where I was in 1986?

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:90%
Chernobyl.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:84%
My family got heavily affected
by the Chernobyl radiation.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
I got set up for decades of
radiation-induced illnesses.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was in my
20s, I was sick and tired

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:90%
of the medical approach.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
After another diagnosis of
fatal diagnosis, I was like, OK,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to take
matters into my own hands

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and figure out how
to heal my body.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, I came from
a family of scientists

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and also from an
environment that

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
was rich with natural
healing, great food,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
where the pharmaceutical
industry didn't take

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:84%
over the medicine, where
we had bioenergy as devices

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:84%
used by many people, where we
very much respected nature,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.410 align:middle line:84%
respected herbal approaches,
where we respected

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you
need to eat real food,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that children have to be
in nature and summertime,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:90%
and the houses growing food.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:90%
So that all worked in my favor.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And with combination of learning
a lot about technologies that

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
can help me heal my body, with
all sorts of crazy detoxes,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.460 align:middle line:84%
addressing my mental state
and addressing my traumas.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:10%
After three or four years
of going back and forth,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:10%
I finally became healthy.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't solve
some of the major issues

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
with my body, specifically
thyroid and ovarian health,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
because that was heavily
affected by radiation.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was constantly
teetering, touring,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out how
to keep myself healthy

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.377 align:middle line:90%
and keep myself off of drugs.

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I was
told that I was never

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.410 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to have kids.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:84%
With the help of nutrigenomics
and everything that was done,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I accidentally found
myself pregnant,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:84%
which was the biggest
blessing in disguise,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%
but also the biggest lesson.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
I was not prepared to have
a child in my late 30s,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
under resourced,
being self-employed,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
being a provider in a family,
and not having immediate family

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.186 align:middle line:90%
How many women relate to this?

00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
society that does not

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
support women in their
early years of motherhood.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:90%
There is no support systems.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:90%
We are burnt out.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:90%
We are under-slept.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:90%
We can way too many stresses.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And the breaking point
for me was when one day I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
screamed on my child
for just spilling water

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't have enough
sleep, because I was worried

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
about finances, because I wasn't
using the tools that helped me

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
heal on a regular basis
when I was healing myself,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.153 align:middle line:90%
because there was no time.

00:03:25.153 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
There was no time
for any of this,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.430 align:middle line:90%
or so I was telling myself.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So at that moment, I vowed that
for my child, for my family,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I will prioritize
my nervous system

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:90%
regulation and my practices.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And I will turn my life
around to make sure

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:90%
that I'm doing those.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So why is it so important for us
to regulate our nervous state?

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly going between
parasympathetic and sympathetic

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
systems, from fight or
flight to rest and digest.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Also we should be.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.980 align:middle line:90%
So do animals do in the wild.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.230 align:middle line:84%
They're able to run
away from predators.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the
danger is not there,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:84%
they happily go back to
grazing, not thinking

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:90%
about lions chasing them.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.200 align:middle line:90%
We have lions.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.050 align:middle line:90%
They are here.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:90%
They're here.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:90%
They're on our phones.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
They follow us from work in
the form of text messages

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:90%
and the form of emails.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
They are in a traffic
in the form of cars.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
They are in our Instagram in
the forms of negative messages.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
There are so many ways we
are reducing our ability

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to regulate our nervous system,
and we are fight or flight

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Majority of women that
come to our practice

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:84%
have a really hard time
finding time for themselves.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.810 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I
always hear from them,

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time to meditate.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time to regulate.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:90%
How do I do this?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I can't sit down and find
a way to quiet my mind

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:90%
or do some breathwork.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And those are the things
that help us shift

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.850 align:middle line:90%
breathing, nature, laughing.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Spending time with your partner,
having sex, having pleasure.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that
we were told not to pursue.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Supposed to be successful.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
We are supposed to get a, y, z
from your money, from status.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:84%
We were not told
to pursue things

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:90%
that are giving us oxytocin.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:84%
That is the main
important hormone

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.020 align:middle line:90%
that overrides everything else.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So women specifically
are so attuned to stress.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly
figuring out, is it

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:90%
a good time to have a baby?

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Is there enough
hormones to have a baby?

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Is there enough food?

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.088 align:middle line:90%
Is there a lion chasing me?

00:05:33.088 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there a lion
chasing me right now?

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, there is not enough time
right now to make hormones.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:90%
We have to run away.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
That's the state
we're in all the time.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And when we are surprised why
our cycles are dysregulated,

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.620 align:middle line:84%
we have PMS, we have headaches,
we have all these things.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And again, it goes
back to I have no time.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So what if I told you
if there was a way

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:90%
to marry technology and nature?

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
There is a wonderful
technology that's

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.770 align:middle line:84%
been around for 70 years that
was actually born in Russia.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.490 align:middle line:84%
It's called PEMF, Pulsed
Electromagnetic Frequency

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:90%
devices.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.440 align:middle line:90%
It was perfected by Germans.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:90%
It's being used by NASA.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.550 align:middle line:84%
It's being used in medicine
for regulating inflammation,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:84%
for creating more
signaling in the body,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:84%
for cellular metabolism,
for healing bones,

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:90%
for recovery, for energy.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.700 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes or so
a day can really

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
easily help you go from
fight or flight to rest

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:90%
and digest and find that calm.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
PEMF has been shown to increase
GABA, our neurochemical of calm.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:90%
GABA, of course, helps us sleep.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:84%
If we sleep a little bit deeper,
if we sleep a little bit better,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
will we be able to maybe be
more a little bit resourceful?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Be able to handle
those tantrums?

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Be able to not snap at the loved
ones because that's who gets it?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.372 align:middle line:84%
That's not people
are out here when

00:06:59.372 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:90%
you're interacting with them.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the people at home.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Where we get triggered, where
we get all these patterning

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
from our families, and all of
a sudden this emotional vomit

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:90%
And we can't stop it.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:90%
We see it.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:90%
We want to stop it.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
We want to be better,
but we just can't.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So 20 minutes a
day can really help

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
you get to antonymic
nervous system response,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
more dialed in, and maybe
create a little bit more space

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
for that laughter
session with your child,

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit of
time with your spouse,

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit of time
of calm in your mind

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:90%
so you can meditate.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to unplug
and not do anything

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:90%
while you're using your PEMF?

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:39.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.255 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in the beginning,
you're doing it

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:90%
while you're doing your emails.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:90%
I do that.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:90%
It happens a lot.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like a little
charging station.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
By the afternoon, I am done.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:90%
I need that coffee.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:90%
I need that chocolate.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.260 align:middle line:90%
What do I reach for?

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:90%
My PEMF math.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:90%
That's my coffee.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:84%
That's my break, that's
my biohacking nap.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It helps to charge my cells,
calm me down, and set me

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
up for a little
bit calmer evening.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And maybe reminds
me that I don't

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:90%
have to respond to that text.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to open my
email after 6 o'clock.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have to spend time with
family, with my loved ones,

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and find other ways
to regulate myself.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people
that technology got it

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:90%
into this place.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:84%
We had created a
monster in some ways.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:84%
We have created an industry
that is pumping chemicals.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.070 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Technology is not going away.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be here.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
How about we find ways to
marry nature and introduce

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
those technological
advances that

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.820 align:middle line:84%
can help us build resilient,
beautiful, calm lives?

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end of the
day, our children look at us.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:84%
They are learning from us on
how to regulate their systems.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.870 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to create
a healthier generation.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
How many people have seen the
data that kids that are born now

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:84%
have less life
expectancy than us?

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:90%
That is crazy.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
That is not what I
want for my child.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's up to us to teach
them regulation skills,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
to show the examples of
laughter, meditation, time

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
in nature, ability to
regulate yourself on the spot,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.600 align:middle line:84%
so they can create
a healthier society.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:90%
