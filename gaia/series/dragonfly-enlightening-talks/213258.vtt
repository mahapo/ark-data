00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:13.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:21.500 align:middle line:10%
>> This was me, 2018,
feeling good, feeling trim,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:10%
practicing what I was preaching.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I was eating a low-carb
paleo-based diet.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.910 align:middle line:90%
I was intermittent fasting.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I was exercising.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And I had maintained the
same weight for years.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:90%
And then something happened.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I gained 20 pounds
in six months.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Me, the nutritionist,
the weight loss expert,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:90%
the hormone specialist.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:10%
What happened?

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I hit menopause, or should
I say menopause hit me

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:90%
like a freight train.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Now although it's
unusual to hit menopause

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.550 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 42,
which I was, it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:84%
not unusual for women
to gain a lot of weight

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
very quickly from
losing their hormones,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
even those that are
doing everything right.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
We begin perimenopause typically
between the ages of 35 and 40,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to lose three
vital hormones-- estrogen,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:90%
progesterone, and testosterone.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And between the ages of
35 and 40, the first to go

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:90%
is progesterone.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Takes a deep dive, as you
can see, from the graph.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Now we produce the majority
of our progesterone

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:90%
when we ovulate.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And as we start getting into
our late 30s, early 40s,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
we don't ovulate as
often and, eventually,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:90%
we don't ovulate at all.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So progesterone goes
down, down, down.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Now progesterone is
key for metabolism.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
When you produce
progesterone, your metabolism

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:90%
actually goes up.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So over time, we're not
producing very much progesterone

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
anymore, which means the
metabolism starts to go down.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Progesterone is also
super important for sleep.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It acts on what's called the
GABA receptors of your brain.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably
all heard of GABA.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's in a lot of supplements,
a lot of sleep supplements.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:90%
It's very calming.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So without the progesterone,
now we're not sleeping so well.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And we know when
you're not sleeping,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
you can actually become
insulin-resistant

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:90%
from poor sleep.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Even just one
night of poor sleep

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:90%
can raise your blood glucose.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And because
progesterone is super

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
important for that relaxation,
calming effect, without it,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:90%
we can start getting anxiety.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sorry, ladies,
but who really wants

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:10%
to eat that great big
bowl of healthy salad

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.115 align:middle line:10%
with that lean chicken breast
on top, with the olive oil on it

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:10%
when you haven't slept, you're
a little bit insulin-resistant,

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.160 align:middle line:10%
and you've got anxiety?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:10%
No, we want the
bowl of chocolate

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:10%
with some ice cream on
top and maybe a little bit

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:10%
of whipped cream
drizzled on the top.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And weight starts to go up.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Then between the ages,
typically, of 45 and 50,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
we start to lose estrogen,
a specific estrogen called

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:90%
estradiol.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And most women, we associate
estrogen with weight gain,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
but actually, the
loss of estradiol

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
can cause more weight gain
than any other hormonal loss.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Because estradiol is needed
to help process blood glucose.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So as estrogen begins to drop,
blood glucose begins to rise,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and we become even
more insulin-resistant

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.835 align:middle line:84%
and we start to store
that energy as fat.

00:04:55.835 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Bad cholesterol
will start to go up.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Estradiol is needed to make a
very important antidepressant

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
neurotransmitter
called serotonin.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So now we've got the low
metabolism, we're not sleeping,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.920 align:middle line:84%
we've got anxiety, oh,
and we're depressed.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's just throw that on top.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're really wanting to
eat healthy now, aren't we?

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
More weight gain, and
typically, all in the belly.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Lucky us.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.155 align:middle line:90%
Hey, ladies, lucky us.

00:05:33.155 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Now testosterone, most
women think of testosterone

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.860 align:middle line:84%
as a man's hormone and
it's all for the guys.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, we produce
more testosterone

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
than we do estrogen
or progesterone

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:90%
in our fertile years.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:90%
So testosterone begins to drop.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And testosterone is needed
to maintain and build

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:90%
muscle tissue.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And the more muscle you have,
the better your metabolic rate

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:90%
is going to be.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:84%
As well, muscle helps us
to process blood glucose.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And as we start losing
this testosterone,

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:84%
we can develop sarcopenia,
the loss of muscle.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And once again, blood sugar
can continue to go up.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:90%
More weight gain.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.940 align:middle line:84%
80% of women will feel the
symptoms of perimenopause.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
common symptoms reported

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
is weight gain.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And 100% of you women,
if you have not already,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:90%
will lose ovarian function.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot run
your way out of that.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
You cannot supplement
your way out of that.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
You cannot intermittent-fast
your way out.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot diet your
way out of hormonal loss.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:90%
Now don't get me wrong.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
All of those things have
to be part of this picture,

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
have to be part of this
journey through to menopause.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:90%
We have to eat well.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:90%
We have to intermittent fast.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.950 align:middle line:90%
We've got to sleep.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
We've got to watch
our stress levels.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:84%
We've got to
maintain the muscle.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:90%
We need community.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We need each other more
than any other time

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:90%
while we go through menopause.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But without these
vital hormones,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:90%
you will only get so far.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
We know that women who
replace their hormones

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.980 align:middle line:84%
have a drastic improvement in
overall health and vitality.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
We also know from
extensive research

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that the majority-- not all,
but the majority of women

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:84%
can safely replace
their hormones.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:84%
We know from the research
that replacing your hormones

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.938 align:middle line:84%
can actually reduce your risk of
cardiac mortality by up to 47%.

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:84%
That is the number
one killer of women.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
We know from a recent
study that women

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
who replace their estradiol for
six years or longer in menopause

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
had up to a 75% to 80% reduction
in developing Alzheimer's

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and dementia, also known
as type III diabetes.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
We know from a cohort
study on menopausal women

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:84%
that the women who
replaced their hormones

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
had a whopping 69% reduction
in developing type II diabetes.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
We know from the research that
women who replace their hormones

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
can have up to a 33% reduction
in all-cause mortality,

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
up to 30% reduction
in all cancers,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:90%
including breast cancer.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And we know from the research
that the women who replace

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
their hormones have less weight
gain than the women who don't.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So ladies, if you want to
sail through this time,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
feeling your best,
looking your best,

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:84%
you have got to
mind your hormones.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:90%
