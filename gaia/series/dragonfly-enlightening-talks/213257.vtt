00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARLY LETZT:
It's the mid '80s.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.870 align:middle line:10%
I'm in high school.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm a top athlete
and a top student.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
And I'm extremely
traumatized and stressed.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.830 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know it yet.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I developed an
identity to not feel

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and to perform at a
really high level.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know how that was
going to affect and shape me

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:90%
as I moved forward in life.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So now let's fast forward
to the early 2000s.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a practicing
chiropractor.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And I've been through
a lot of healing,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:84%
really amazing
different modalities

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and experiences, things
that you've all heard

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:90%
about before it was even cool--

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
breathwork, yoga,
transcendental meditation--

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.155 align:middle line:84%
that all alongside my
chiropractic curriculum

00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and a body of work
that you might have

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.000 align:middle line:90%
heard of called Network Spinal.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I eventually became one of
the international instructors

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:90%
of that particular technique.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
But now let's go back
to the early 2000s.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
At the end of my
morning, adjusting hours,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I had my last patient
of the morning

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
who insisted that I lay
on my own adjusting table.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And usually, I would have said
no to something like that.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
She insisted that I lay
on my own adjusting table.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to
do a reading for me.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
What I hadn't told her
is that for many months,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
after all of this healing
and transformational

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
work that I had done, I
was being visited regularly

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:90%
by a beautiful feminine spirit.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And I laid on my own table.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And she said, my patient, do
you want to have children?

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said, gosh,
I hope that I'm

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:84%
blessed with a healthy,
beautiful child

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
She then said, do you care
if it's a boy or a girl?

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, just
a beautiful child.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, there's a
feminine spirit all around you.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:90%
And she's your future daughter.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to
lead you to her father.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said good
thing because I don't

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
want an Immaculate Conception
type of thing right now.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in a relationship.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.782 align:middle line:84%
And she just said,
don't worry, she's

00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:53.115 align:middle line:90%
going to lead you to her father.

00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's fast forward a few
years into the future, when

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:90%
the veil was not quite so thin.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I thought back to
these experiences, I thought,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:90%
I must have been imagining this.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Was I losing my mind?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I had kissed
a lot of toads.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And none of them
turned into a prince.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the first time I heard
Mark's voice in the mid 2000s,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:90%
it all came rushing back to me.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I knew instantly that my patient
many years before was right.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:90%
It resounded through my field.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:90%
It's him.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:90%
It's him.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.240 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years
later, we were married.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of
years after that, we

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
had our only child
who's about to turn 16.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:84%
That experience and a
lot of the other mystical

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
experiences before that informed
how I worked with people

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and how I've worked with myself
and went through my own healing

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:84%
Here are some of the
takeaways from that time

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and continued
through to this day.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
We are stringed instruments
of consciousness.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that
is our nervous system,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
specifically our spinal cord,
attaches to bone up in our neck

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:90%
and down at the sacrum.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Our spinal cord isn't really
any different than a guitar

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:90%
string or a cello or a violin.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And we can be in coherence
or out of coherence.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
When we have experiences
that are overwhelming to us,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
where something happens
or many things happen

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:84%
that are too soon,
too fast, too much,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
or somehow we've been neglected,
we store that trauma and energy

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.760 align:middle line:84%
in our nervous system, in
our field, and in our body.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.300 align:middle line:84%
But the cool thing is
we have an opportunity

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:90%
to connect and release that.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And connecting and
releasing the energy

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that we bind at other
times in our life

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.710 align:middle line:84%
really is what gives us access
to the quantum, to the field--

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:84%
to the field of
all possibilities.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
This is an overlooked
aspect of healing, health,

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:90%
and transformation.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I've seen many people over the
years who eat perfectly, do

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:90%
yoga, do breathwork.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.360 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't really
connected to the bound energy

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.010 align:middle line:84%
that they've stored, which
is nothing wrong with--

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:90%
there's no judgment in that--

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
but that they've
stored over time

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feel safe and
move forward in their life.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to tell
all of you or really

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
to invite you to witness
with me and join me

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
in this quantum human evolution
that I know many of you

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:90%
are aware of.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you haven't
yet, this is the time

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
to connect and release
any bound energy from past

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and allowing that to guide
you forward in your life

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.410 align:middle line:90%
because it is a missing piece.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's very needed now.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
All of us are here to share and
receive gifts and to connect

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
to that everlasting,
ever-present,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:90%
transcendent aspect--

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:90%
the soul.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:90%
It's timeless.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no beginning and no end.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And our access to that
is through our recovery

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.880 align:middle line:90%
from stress and trauma.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:90%
See, all of you are souls.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:90%
You're not roles.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.090 align:middle line:84%
You're not stagnant
roles in life.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
You're ever-present,
transcendent souls.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And every single one
of you is unique.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of you is
unique, like a fingerprint.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Even identical twins don't
have the same fingerprint.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Even identical twins
don't have the same soul.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So in this quantum human
evolution, we are all important.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:90%
We all matter.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And it is time to connect to
that everlasting, ever-present

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:90%
quantum aspect.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.790 align:middle line:10%
And throughout my
life and my career,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:10%
that is the thing that
consistently stays with us.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And we can go through life
with using a lot of effort

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and the physical.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Or we can connect to
that transcendent aspect

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
stresses and traumas

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that we've experienced
as a portal

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to connecting to the field, to
the quantum, and to our souls.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being here with us today.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:90%
