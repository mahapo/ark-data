ANITA SANCHEZ: Welcome,
all my precious relations.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:10%
As Sarah told you, I wake up for
22 and 1/2 years every morning

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
as the Earth turns, so that
I can see the sun and receive

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:10%
the seeds of light.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.930 align:middle line:90%
And this is a special time.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And you are meant to be here.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what I received
is exactly what

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to share with
you, which is, first,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
just welcome from the
first peoples here.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm Nahua on my mother's side,
which people know as Aztec.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And on my father's
side, I'm Toltec.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still learning about
myself because I also have just

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago did my 23andMe.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I found out that 15%
of me is from the Amazon.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And since 2007, I've been
leading groups there every year.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:90%
I never knew why.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
But we all know inside of
each of us is our ancestors.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So welcome from the people,
the first peoples who

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:84%
cared for this land,
this beauty that you're

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:90%
experiencing, that you're here.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
That is the people of
the Cheyenne, the Ute,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:90%
and the Arapaho.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And they are still here.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:90%
They are not gone.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And so every day,
I give gratitude.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.368 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to give
gratitude, as you already are--

00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and you've been here
for a number of days--

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:90%
to this land, this mother Earth.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:90%
And as I walk up--

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I live in North Boulder in
the foothills for 43 years.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And as I walk that, I listen
and listen and listen.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And as I listen, I could hear
through the winds the sound.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And about six years ago, all
of a sudden, it became a song.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, I realized
it wasn't a song.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:90%
It was a chant.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
It was a chant from
all our relatives.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
all our relatives,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that's not only two-legged human
beings, but for all the beings--

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
the four-leggeds, all
the minerals, the water,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
the creepy crawlers, the
winged ones, the dragonflies.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:90%
All of this are our relatives.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to say, do a
chant to the four directions.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I invite you
to do is to listen

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
with the softest part of your
ears and your expanding heart.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, after that,
I'll share what the sun

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:90%
told me to share with you.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:84%
So to the east,
the red direction,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:90%

we have all the colors

Go ahead and take a deep breath.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I can see that your
hearts are expanding

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and just continue to lift with
the softest part of your ears.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And as I receive the seeds
of light this morning,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.920 align:middle line:90%
the sun said, share this story.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to make
it a very short story.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's a story of my
grandmother on my mother's side.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And I loved being with
my Nahua grandmother.

And we'd go there
sometimes on weekends.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:90%

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And we went.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.265 align:middle line:84%
And she was going
to do something

00:05:04.265 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:90%
different this weekend.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
She said, Saturday,
I'm going to wake--

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.460 align:middle line:84%
we're going to wake up
before the sun rises.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
out to my garden.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And every hour on Saturday, I'm
going to bring you out here.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And you need to be
quiet for five minutes.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So we love our grandmothers,
so we all did it, right?

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:90%
And so we went out.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, we stood by
her garden where there's

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:90%
mirasols, which is sunflowers.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And so as you can
imagine, we stood there.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:90%
And what did the sunflowers do?

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:90%
They looked to the sun.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So every hour, she'd bring
us from whatever we're doing.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.910 align:middle line:84%
We'd come back,
and we were quiet.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And we realized we were moving
with the sunflowers all day

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:90%
long.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell
you, by lunchtime,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:84%
even though I was that young,
I didn't want to go to lunch.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go back
to the sunflowers.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
I think you all have
that feeling at times

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to be in nature,
which we are part of.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:90%
And so we did that.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the end of
the day, it was dark.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And she said, we have
to go in to dinner.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:90%
So we go have dinner.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.340 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother never
debriefed anything

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that she had us experience
because she trusted our wisdom

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and trusted that we still
were aware there were part

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:90%
of the earth and not separate.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.840 align:middle line:84%
We're part of all of our
relations and not separate.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And so after we finished,
it was pitch black--

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Midwest Missouri.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:90%
And she took a flashlight.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
She didn't turn it on.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:90%
And she said, come on.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, it's
really dark out there.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So we go out, and I guess
she takes us somewhere

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:90%
near her garden again.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, hush,
so we're all quiet.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:84%
She turns a light on the
ground, and we can see.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:84%
We're all circled,
facing each other.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, she puts
the flashlight over

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:90%
to her sunflower garden.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And all the sunflowers
are looking at each other.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the sun
wanted me to share with you.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You people who are so special,
you are gathering and putting

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
out the word of well-being.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And that even in the darkest
dark, when we were out there

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and couldn't see, what
she showed us as we

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:90%
were looking to each other--

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:84%
the light that is
always within us.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But when we looked
at sunflowers,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:90%
nature also does that.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's to not forget
is the message.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And that while
you're here, fill up

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.320 align:middle line:84%
because the original
instruction has always

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
been to be a life-giving
member of the one hoop of life

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:84%
is to care for one's self, love
one's self, and care and love
