00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.808 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:12.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.860 align:middle line:10%
>> So I was raised in a
traditional Indian household

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:10%
by two of the most loving
and supportive parents.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.092 align:middle line:84%
They taught me to strive for
excellence and perfection

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and taught me to work
hard for the things

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.600 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted in my life.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Although that led to a
very successful career,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:84%
it led to a lot of challenges
in intimacy and dating.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
I had a really hard time
opening up and being

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable with my partners.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And I put a lot of
pressure on myself

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:90%
to be perfect in every moment.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
This led to guilt and
shame that I internalized,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:84%
which then led to
crippling anxiety

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
when we would try
to be intimate.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget the first time
I experienced what I thought

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:90%
was erectile dysfunction.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually just
performance anxiety.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.210 align:middle line:90%
But I had no idea.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:90%
I just thought I was broken.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So I was in my 20s,
dating a beautiful girl.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:90%
And I just couldn't get aroused.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
time I'd experienced

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.885 align:middle line:90%
anything of the sort.

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:90%
And I was devastated.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I thought my life was over.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I experienced shame, guilt,
worry, embarrassment, fear,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:90%
anxiety.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But I was motivated enough
to find that magic pill.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:90%
So I bought all the supplements.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I paid for the expensive
red light therapy machines

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:90%
and biohacking devices.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.190 align:middle line:90%
I read all the books.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
I even almost injected
my penis with stem cells.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I didn't
go down that path.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But it did start a
very important line

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
of inquiry with myself
around what was going on.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
What was my body
trying to teach me?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Why was my poor nervous
system so activated?

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
On the recommendation
of a friend,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I hired a hypnotherapist.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And after several sessions and
a lot of deep conversations,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I stumbled on an insight
that would change the way I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:90%
looked at health forever.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
It turns out my body was
responding to a deep core

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.460 align:middle line:84%
emotional wound and limiting
belief learned in childhood

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:84%
that if I wasn't
showing up perfectly,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't deserving
of love and pleasure.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.080 align:middle line:10%
You see, my body was
not broken, my mind was.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:10%
My deepest core
emotional wounding

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:10%
was expressing itself
as a physical symptom.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:10%
Why is it that the mental
and emotional aspects

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.700 align:middle line:10%
of our physical health
symptoms are oftentimes

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:10%
the last things we consider?

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:10%
We're living in a
growing health epidemic.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.350 align:middle line:10%
16.9 million people are
living in the United States

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:10%
today with cancer, projected
to be 22.2 million by 2030.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:10%
24 million Americans are
living with some type

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:10%
of autoimmune condition.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.040 align:middle line:84%
86 million Americans are
living with some type

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:90%
of cardiovascular disease.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Addiction, anxiety, and
depression have 3x since

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.230 align:middle line:90%
the dawn of the pandemic.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And what is the common
denominator here?

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, the CDC did a study
that linked every single one

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:10%
of those diseases back to
adverse childhood experiences

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:10%
and the chronic stress
that's put on our bodies

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:10%
from being in a state of
fight-or-flight for so long.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, I used to think
that an adverse childhood

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
experience meant the big-T
Trauma, the physical abuse,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:90%
the sexual abuse.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:10%
I was shocked to discover
that the CDC actually

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:10%
defined emotional neglect,
like rejection and abandonment,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:10%
to be 1 of 10 adverse
childhood experiences that

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:10%
lead to poor health symptoms.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, furthermore,
I used to think

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:10%
that a fight-or-flight response
was like the big freak-outs

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:10%
and the panic attacks.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised to discover
that there are actually

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
four documented types of
fight-or-flight responses, one

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:90%
of them being people pleasing.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:10%
How many of you know
somebody or have personally

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.008 align:middle line:10%
experienced
difficulty in setting

00:03:57.008 --> 00:03:59.675 align:middle line:10%
healthy boundaries out of a fear
of disappointing somebody else?

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle line:84%
How many of you either know
someone personally or personally

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
have a hard time speaking
your truth out of a fear

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:90%
of disappointing somebody else?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.589 align:middle line:84%
We believe that these chronic
survival patterns, learned

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
as a result of adverse
childhood experiences,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.790 align:middle line:84%
are having a much greater
impact on our health

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
than we're currently
taking seriously.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
We believe that
emotional lab reporting

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
needs to be done
on the forefront,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
alongside other medical
diagnostic tools, not

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.490 align:middle line:84%
as a last-ditch effort,
where we're proactively

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:84%
looking for and uncovering
those chronic survival

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
patterns learned as a result of
adverse childhood experiences

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that are contributing
to poor health symptoms.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Over the last
several years, we've

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
partnered with Dr. Nasha Winters
and the Metabolic Terrain

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Health to run 312
emotional lab reports on 107

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
cancer patients and
collect up to 500 data

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:90%
points on ACEs per patient.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:90%
The data does not lie.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:10%
Out of our patient
population, 70% of them

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:10%
are able to track present-day
emotional stressors back

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:10%
to adverse childhood experiences
where they didn't feel seen,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.210 align:middle line:10%
where they learned
that they didn't

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.960 align:middle line:10%
matter, where they
felt invisible

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.260 align:middle line:10%
to a primary caretaker.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Again, the data does not lie.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, our approach to
precision emotional healing

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:90%
hinges on one big idea.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:10%
When you use specific tools
and methodologies to address

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:10%
the root chronic
survival patterns,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:10%
learned as a result of
adverse childhood experiences

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:10%
that are contributing to
nervous system dysregulation,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:10%
you can experience quantum
shifts in your health and life.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:10%
Let's take Angie as an example.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Angie is a three-time
leukemia survivor.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.948 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can imagine
the type of narratives

00:05:56.948 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that she might be living
with, after having

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.810 align:middle line:90%
three bouts with leukemia.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.403 align:middle line:90%
Why am I broken?

00:06:04.403 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine
the fear you might

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
have just by getting leukemia
once, going into remission,

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and then just silently wondering
if it's going to come back.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:90%
Fast forward that three times.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
Angie also felt like
a burden, though.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So she didn't want to put that
on her friends and family.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So she internalized
all that stress.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Angie knew that something
needed to change.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And when she came to us,
we knew we could help her.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Over three months,
we supported Angie

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:84%
in tracking all of those
little emotional triggers,

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
the big-T Triggers and
the little-t triggers,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:84%
the fears of going
to get her labs done,

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
the moments where she felt
like a burden, the moments

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:84%
where she didn't feel
seen by her doctors.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And we tracked those feelings
all the way back in time

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
to the original root
experiences, the five-year-old

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.150 align:middle line:84%
in her that learned she had
to people please in order

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:90%
to be safe.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Angie then engaged in a
consistent breathwork practice

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:90%
to regulate her nervous system.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
She learned tools like inner
child work and internal family

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:84%
systems to hold space for that
scared little girl within her,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to hold space for
the anger and learn

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:90%
how to feel it and express it.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:84%
She learned tools like
nonviolent communication

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.315 align:middle line:84%
and authentic
relating so that she

00:07:20.315 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
could learn how to communicate
her needs in a healthy way

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:90%
with the people in her life.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.970 align:middle line:84%
In three months, Angie's
life is completely different.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Not only does Angie not live
with the fear of cancer coming

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
back anymore, but
she is profoundly

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
grateful for every single lesson
and blessing that has come

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:90%
from each of her diagnoses.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.880 align:middle line:84%
She no longer feels
like a burden.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And she can communicate
her needs effectively

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.930 align:middle line:84%
with her family and
get them met in return.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
Angie was told

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.770 align:middle line:84%
after three bouts with
leukemia that she would never

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
have a total blood cell count
back in a normal range again.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, after three months
of precision emotional

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
healing and looking at the
root of her nervous system

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.350 align:middle line:84%
dysregulation, Angie went
and got her blood work done.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And to her shock and
her oncologist's shock,

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
her total blood cell count
was back in a normal range.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And not just normal for
people living with cancer,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:84%
this is normal for
people in general.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:84%
If something like
this could be possible

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:84%
for an individual like
Angie, if transformations

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:84%
could be possible
for someone like me,

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
who used to have so much
anxiety and so much self-shame

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:84%
just circulating
in the background,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
to feeling safe in my body
for the first time in my life,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
able to feel my emotions
and express them,

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:90%
what could be possible for you?

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
What could be possible if you
learned to slow down and listen

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:84%
to the wisdom of your
symptoms before you reached

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
for the next greatest biohacking
tool or gadget or supplement?

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.730 align:middle line:10%
We believe that your mind
can play the greatest role

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.770 align:middle line:10%
and is your biggest ally
on your healing journey.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But in order to activate
the healer of the mind,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:90%
you must have courage.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:10%
The courage to hold
space for all of you

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:10%
and to accept yourself as
you are, especially the parts

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:10%
that you don't want to.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:84%
The courage to believe that
you are not your diagnosis,

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that you are not
broken, and that you

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
can have a new
possibility in the future.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
The courage to let
go of resentments

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that do not serve and ask
for the help you need.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:10%
We believe that it's time to
start looking at our childhoods

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:10%
through the lens of
curiosity instead of fear.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And we believe that if we
band together as a community

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and support each other on this
journey of radical self-love,

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:84%
we will have the greatest
trickle-down impact

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:90%
on the future of health.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:90%
