00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.180 align:middle line:10%
>> There is nothing like
watching the light go out

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:10%
of someone you love.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a powerless
helpless feeling.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And over 25 years ago, I watched
the light and life go out

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:84%
of my brother, who suffered
from pain, fatigue, vertigo,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and overall lifelessness.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Before he experienced
this, he was full of life.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:90%
He was full of laughter.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
His passion was
art, and he loved

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
to express his love
for the community

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
through many different
types of art,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
but he was unable to do what
he loved the most because he

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:84%
was so sick, debilitated,
and stayed constantly in bed.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
He tried everything he
could, nothing worked.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:90%
He went outside the country.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
He tried alternative.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
He tried integrative--
he tried everything.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until he went to his
dentist, and his dentist said,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Jason, I think those mercury
amalgam fillings in your mouth

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:90%
are leaking into your body.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is causing
all of this trauma.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:84%
You need to find a way to get
the mercury out of your body.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:90%
And I think I can help.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've been reading
about a technology that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
has been studied extensively
in Asia called infrared.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.450 align:middle line:84%
An infrared has the
possibility of removing mercury

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.130 align:middle line:90%
from your body.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:90%
I think you should explore it.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly
what my brother did.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:90%
He bought an infrared sauna.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Started the process.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:90%
It was very slow.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:90%
But let me tell you.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
I remember one day when I
went over to his apartment,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and I saw him up
moving around, and it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.170 align:middle line:84%
was glorious because I
hadn't seen him moving.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:90%
We stopped all vacations.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.348 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible for our family.

00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Jason,
how are you doing?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I feel a
little bit better.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:90%
But just him moving was magic.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So he kept doing it daily, and
eventually, it changed his life.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a stressful
situation like this,

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
you could never even imagine
that something so stressful

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:84%
could have such a positive
ripple impact on your life

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So I was watching this
transformation of my brother.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was
working at Procter & Gamble

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
in the pharmaceutical
division-- and I loved my job.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And I loved pharmaceuticals
because my mission

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:84%
was to help people live
healthier lives through what

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to make a difference.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.143 align:middle line:84%
It was my entire being
was to make a difference.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
doing that because I

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:84%
was in the
gastrointestinal field,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I was in Crohn's and
Colitis Foundation.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the
cardiovascular division

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:90%
with blood pressure medications.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was still so amazed with
how my brother did something

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.235 align:middle line:84%
on his own safely, not
adversely affecting his body

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever because that's
what we worry about

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
in the pharmaceutical,
but he was

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
able to safely,
naturally heal himself.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, I've
never heard of this.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
do some research.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So I said on my journey to do
extensive research on infrared.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Astounded-- remember,
this is 25 years ago--

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.210 align:middle line:90%
astounded at what I found.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:90%
I thought I would find nothing.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:84%
No, there was so many clinical
trials done in Asia on infrared,

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
specifically in the
cardiovascular arena.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, it helped
improve blood flow.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.593 align:middle line:84%
It helped endothelial lining
get more oxygen to the heart.

00:04:05.593 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It helped with
congestive heart failure.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
It helped with coronary
artery disease.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.850 align:middle line:90%
It helped so many things.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what in the
world is going on.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Why is nobody talking
about this amazing thing,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:84%
and really doing it in the
safety of your own home

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:90%
without altering your body?

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So I changed my life, and I left
my safe, comfortable, rewarding

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
career at Procter &
Gamble and started

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:90%
on this entrepreneurial journey.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I describe it,
I jumped out of a plane

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.696 align:middle line:90%
without a parachute or plan B.

00:04:36.696 --> 00:04:39.300 align:middle line:84%
But I really wanted to
get the word out and let

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:84%
people know about this powerful
healing wavelength called

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:90%
infrared.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:90%
So what is it, anyway?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:90%
And can it help me?

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Can it help you?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Infrared is the
light, the healing

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and healthy part
of the light coming

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
from the sun that is natural
and safe for all living things.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:90%
It is needed.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.205 align:middle line:84%
Infrared light constitutes
about 60% of the sunlight.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So you know when you go
outside, and the sun comes out,

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and you feel that and you just
feel this gentle hug around you,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
you're like, oh my God,
that feels so good.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:90%
That's infrared.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.880 align:middle line:90%
That's that feeling.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:90%
It feels so good.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:90%
And we need it to survive.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:90%
So infrared is heat.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It heats up the body directly
without heating the air.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So you get hot inside
because your body

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
is hot through this magical
absorption of the heat.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:90%
It's light.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies are solar panels.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:84%
We are designed and need
infrared light to charge

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:90%
and activate our cells inside.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:90%
60% is water, 10% mitochondria.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
So over 70% of your
body, our bodies

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:84%
need that activation
in order to initiate

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
the biochemical pathways
to affect and impact

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:90%
every single system in our body.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Infrared constitutes a spectrum
of light far, mid, and near--

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is the spectrum
near is also known

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.560 align:middle line:90%
as photobiomodulation or PBM.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those pieces has
magical healing transformative

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
properties that
can significantly

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:90%
impact your well-being.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.502 align:middle line:90%
So I love science.

00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to
go for just a second

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:84%
into some scientific studies on
a couple of different conditions

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.980 align:middle line:84%
just to validate that it's
more than just the sun

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.490 align:middle line:90%
and how it works with your body.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.470 align:middle line:90%
So first, inflammation.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation, also known as
inflammaging because it is

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:90%
the number one cause for aging.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And there are plenty
of studies showing

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
how infrared can help slow
down the aging process

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and how it can regulate
your inflammatory systems.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, one study
was done on a gene that

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:90%
is in charge-- it's called HO1.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.110 align:middle line:84%
It's in charge of regulating
all of your inflammation.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And infrared helps to
activate that gene.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Detoxification.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:90%
This is a big one.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:84%
We're exposed to over 700,000
chemicals every single day.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Infrared heats
your body directly,

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.760 align:middle line:84%
increases your core
temperature, and you sweat out

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:90%
at a cellular level.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So you're sweating out deeper
than any other type of sweat.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:84%
There's been plenty of studies
showing that infrared will

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
reduce your toxic load
by removing heavy metals,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:84%
bismuth, PCBs more than
traditional saunas,

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:90%
as well as exercise.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
There is a study
called the BUS study--

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Blood, Urine, Sweat
study that showed

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that 15% of the participants had
no detectable levels of mercury

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:90%
in their blood.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:84%
However, 100% of that 15%
had high levels of mercury

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:90%
in their sweat.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So the power and the
necessity of using

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.040 align:middle line:84%
infrared to sweat out this toxic
load that we live in every day

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:90%
is crucial.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Other benefits that can help
you ignite your path to wellness

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:90%
are improved sleep--

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Decreased depression-- plenty of
studies on that improved health

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.929 align:middle line:90%
and cognitive function.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Decreased ability
to-- just decrease

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
cortisol and stress, overall
relaxation, weight loss,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and then probably my
personal favorite is just

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:84%
skin purification and really
helping improve the collagen

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:90%
and elastin in your skin.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So there have been many
people over the past 25 years

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
where infrared has had
a significant impact

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:90%
on their life.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:90%
One of which you may know--

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:90%
I actually have two.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
The first one is Ryan Sutter,
who's right here in Colorado.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So 20 years ago, a lot
of people fell in love

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.090 align:middle line:84%
with the first couple
that got married

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:90%
on the first Bachelorette show.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And Ryan interestingly
enough never

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
shared this story
for a long time,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
but now he is coming out
and sharing because he knows

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:90%
that his story can help others.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So Ryan and Trista got
married, moved to Colorado,

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.580 align:middle line:90%
started a family.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
They were really focused
on a healthy active life.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And they had that
until Ryan was about 45

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and he changed his career to a
different firefighter station

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and started this 18-week
firefighting academy.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Halfway through, he
started feeling horrible.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.173 align:middle line:84%
And he's an athlete,
so he persevered,

00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and he kept thinking,
I think this

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:90%
is just due to the training.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And he kept going and
going until he was so

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
compromised that he could
not get off the couch.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.732 align:middle line:84%
Well, clearly, he and Trista
said, we've got to do something.

00:10:04.732 --> 00:10:05.982 align:middle line:90%
We've got to change something.

00:10:05.982 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So they went on this
journey to figure

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
it out struggled
tremendously until they

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.030 align:middle line:84%
found a local functional
medicine here in Colorado.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And she did test
specifically on Lyme.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And he tested positive for
Lyme disease, mold toxicities,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and some other
underlying infections.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And then she helped him get
on the path to recovery.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The three things that helped
him get active and healthy

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
again were nutrition,
mindfulness, and infrared sauna

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:90%
sessions.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And the infrared sauna
session specifically

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
helped him with detoxification
of all the stuff

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that was in his body, as well
as it activates your heat shock

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.100 align:middle line:90%
proteins.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.642 align:middle line:84%
So it strengthened
his immune system.

00:10:49.642 --> 00:10:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So it could allow him to be
able to fight off viruses

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:90%
when it would happen again.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So LeAnn Rimes--
she is another one

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that I love her
story because it's

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:84%
different from what
I've just shared

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
about being in a situation
where you need treatment.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
She put the power in her
control and sought out help.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you
a little back story.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.980 align:middle line:90%
We all know who she is.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:84%
She has been famous since
she was 14 years old when

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:90%
she won her first Grammy.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And as she describes her
story, she, from 14 to 40,

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:84%
was in a constant state
of fight or flight--

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
constantly in that sympathetic
state where she was stressed out

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:90%
She suffered from anxiety.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:90%
She suffered from depression.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
She was just in a
really bad place.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And so when she was about
to turn 40, she decided,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'm not
going to do that anymore.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:90%
I need to find a better way.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So she sought out Dr.
Mindy Pelz, physician,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
who helped her understand the
balancing of your hormones

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:90%
as she approached menopause.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And really, helped her lay the
foundation how to move forward.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the key foundations
she told LeAnn is you

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:84%
have got to get yourself into
the parasympathetic state.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
You have got to find a way to
relieve the stress and unwind.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways she
recommended was infrared sauna.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And I love when LeAnn describes
this because she says it

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.392 align:middle line:84%
literally she suffers so badly
with anxiety and depression,

00:12:31.392 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and she's like I would
go inside my sauna

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel the
happy chemicals is just

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.810 align:middle line:90%
being released.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.268 align:middle line:84%
And I would have days where I
felt like the world was going

00:12:39.268 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to end, but then I
would go inside my sauna

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and I would come out in a
completely different place.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:84%
She calls it her
box of happiness.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:90%
So how can infrared help you?

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It can help you light
your path to wellness.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
It could be an extreme recovery
like my brother's story,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:84%
it could be a proactive
way like LeAnn story,

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.020 align:middle line:84%
or it could be if you have
a very specific condition

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying to treat such
as inflammation, detoxification,

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
brain function, helping
you do better sleep,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
helping you lose weight,
or just overall feeling

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
better like you want to do
more of what you love to do.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I would love
is to hear your story.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:84%
I strongly feel that if we can
collectively share our wellness

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
experiences, we
can raise the tide

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and elevate all of our
wellness path together.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:90%
