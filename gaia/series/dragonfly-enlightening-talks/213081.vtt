00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.510 align:middle line:10%
>> An index patient is a
patient that changes the way you

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.460 align:middle line:10%
practice medicine.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
And it's because the
patient teaches you.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, you have
to be willing to accept

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:84%
the fact that as a doctor,
you don't know everything.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And my first index patient
was a few years ago.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:84%
She was a 62-year-old
female who had been referred

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:90%
to me by her allergist.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
She had multiple
chemical sensitivities,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:84%
food allergies that were
getting worse and worse.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
She had been investigated to
within an inch of her life.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.270 align:middle line:84%
She was on all sorts of
medications-- mast cell

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.070 align:middle line:90%
stabilizers, antihistamines.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't
tolerate supplements.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not quite sure why the
allergist referred her.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I
was stuck as well.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
listen to our patients.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:90%
We talk to them.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
As she was talking to me,
completely cachexic, by the way.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.530 align:middle line:90%
She was so skinny.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.650 align:middle line:84%
But she had so much
energy and love to give.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And I could see that.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that she had
quite a few mercury

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:90%
fillings in her teeth.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, hey, why don't
we try and get rid of those,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
take those off the table,
see what we're left with.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I call this the domino
way of treating patients.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Knock over one or two things.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
See what you're left
with, as opposed

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:84%
to smashing them with all
sorts of interventions.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And she said no, and
she could afford it.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:90%
But she said no.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
healing journey began

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
because I asked her with
curiosity and compassion,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:90%
why not?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
So turns out that
when she was a child,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
she had been abused in
her mouth by her father.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't want anyone
going anywhere near that.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Long and the short of
it is that we actually

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
wound up finding her
a beautiful, kind,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.190 align:middle line:84%
small dentist with small hands,
who was so compassionate.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And she allowed her daughter--
my patient's daughter--

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to be in the room with
her, hold her hand.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:84%
She got out for all four of
her mercury amalgams out,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.700 align:middle line:90%
two settings.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Favorite music playing.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, little cake
in the staff room after.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Four weeks after, she could
eat anything she wanted.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:90%
I was amazed.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:90%
I was astounded.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:90%
I was humbled.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:90%
She taught me something.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:84%
It took me six months
with her allergist

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
to sit down and really
go through every layer

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:90%
of this patient's history.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So some of the key
takeaways points

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.290 align:middle line:90%
from this particular patient--

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
one, her threat detection
systems in her mouth

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
had been upregulated because
of what had happened to her.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Two, of the four mercury
fillings that were taken out,

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:90%
two were indeed leaking.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were constantly
tripping her threat detection

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:84%
Three, because of that, because
her neuroimmune system was--

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.015 align:middle line:84%
wait, where is this
threat coming from?

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:90%
We're not quite sure.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.140 align:middle line:84%
It was tagging every food that
was coming through her mouth.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Four, when she removed
the immediate threat--

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.430 align:middle line:90%
and this is the important part--

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and she had a positive negative
experience with her mouth

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that she had control
over, that she had agency,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
it talked her nervous
system down from a ledge.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:90%
What are guardian sites?

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:84%
A guardian site of the
body is evolutionarily,

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.450 align:middle line:84%
if your physical
integrity was going

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
to be breached by a
virus or a bacteria,

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:84%
it would usually come through
eyes, nose, respiratory tract,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:84%
mouth, gastrointestinal
tract, vagina,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
skin, especially
if broken or torn,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and especially the parts of your
skin which are very exposed--

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:90%
face, hands, feet.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:84%
We wear sensory deprivation
chambers all the time,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
but our feet are always meant to
be in contact with the ground.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And what is so special
about these guardian sites?

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and, to a lesser extent,
your bladder as well.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:84%
The special thing about
these guardian sites

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:84%
is that it has special
neuroimmune systems.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
It is wired for act now,
ask questions later.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Inflammation.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Because short-term
inflammation is protective.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
It is the beginning of your
repair and your regeneration.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.833 align:middle line:84%
Now, chronic inflammation is
a completely different matter.

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:17.250 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to
talk about that.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But don't tar that brush of
chronic inflammation and disease

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:84%
with acute inflammation,
which is your body trying

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
to protect you now,
because of threats

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:84%
that it can see, that it
can feel, that it can smell,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:84%
or perceived threats, because
your immune system is going

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:84%
to enact inflammation before
it sees what's going on, just

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:90%
in case.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.280 align:middle line:84%
So how does this protective
threat detection network work?

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Because there are various
threat detection systems

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that correlate
data between them.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.930 align:middle line:84%
The reason why redundancies
are built into the system

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
is because your psycho
neuroimmune systems

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:90%
don't want to miss a trick.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, how do we take
information in?

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:90%
You guys know this one.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:90%
The eight senses, right?

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Funnily enough, it correlates
with the guardian sites

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the time.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's your sight, your
smell, your taste, your hearing,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:90%
your touch, your proprioception.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Where are your joints, just
in case you need to run?

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Your vestibular system.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Where are you in space?

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:90%
And interoception.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you know when you're
hungry, when you're thirsty?

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Does your body respond to
blood pressure, temperature?

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:90%
That's interoception.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:90%
So we know that one.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
What about the other many
varied threat detection systems

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:90%
which form a network?

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
We probably know the HHPA axis,
Hippocampus, Hypothalamus,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Pituitary, Adrenal.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Those are going to produce
your stress hormones.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And that works very closely with
another threat detection system,

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:90%
your autonomic nervous system--

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
fight, flight, rest,
digest, freeze, form.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Advanced Glycation End
products, AGE, system--

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:84%
this is why what
you eat and how you

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.680 align:middle line:84%
cook it is so important, because
if you have a high burden of AGE

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
in your food, spoiler alert,
ultra-processed foods have

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:90%
a very high burden of AGEs.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
It's going to affect RAGE, the
receptor for advanced glycation

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:90%
endproducts.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So we have some of
these systems in play.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%
How do they correlate?

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Why do they correlate?

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It's because your body wants
to take in information,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
correlate the data, calculate
risk so that it can then

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:90%
enact protective mechanisms.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's take, for example, you
have had a fight with your boss.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:90%
You're about to leave for lunch.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:90%
You're a little bit geed up.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
You get out there.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:90%
You get your food.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:84%
You're eating in a
sympathetic state now.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Blood pressure a bit up.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:90%
Heart rate's a bit up.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Gastric acid.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Your system is going to go,
all right, is there a threat?

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what everyone
else is saying.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, you're laughing
with your colleagues.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:90%
So you're sitting, not running.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:90%
You're in the sun.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you afraid?

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.745 align:middle line:84%
Don't you want to
go in the cave?

00:08:28.745 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, guys, I think--

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're being
chased by a saber-toothed tiger

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.351 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:84%
But this, of course, is
going to be on the background

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
of your childhood and whether
or not you have resilience,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:84%
because we all know someone--
and maybe even us at some

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:90%
point--

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
where it doesn't take much
to go into full panic,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:90%
fight, flight, whatever it is.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So what this tells you, what
this tells me as a practitioner,

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:90%
we can change this.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:90%
We have control.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:90%
We have agency.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
We can retrain these
systems and make sure

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:09.310 align:middle line:84%
if we really put our heart to
it that it doesn't control us.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
other things at play,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
bacteria, viruses,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
parasites, because we need to
know about temperature, poisons,

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:84%
pollution, and so
on and so forth.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
can be retrained.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Wim Hof can go to
base camp in shorts.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
But he's managed to retrain
his threat detection

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:84%
network that extreme
cold is not a peril.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, if he can do that, we can
take control with our own lives

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
