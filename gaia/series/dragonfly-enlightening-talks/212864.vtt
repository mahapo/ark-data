00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:12.025 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:19.830 align:middle line:10%
>> So 1.1 billion women will
be in menopause by 2025.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.300 align:middle line:10%
If a woman lives long enough,
she will spend 40% of her life

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.100 align:middle line:10%
in menopause.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.072 align:middle line:10%
>> Nice.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:28.548 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Yet we have no answers
for women as we go through

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:10%
the menopausal process.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
For the last 25 years, I have
literally been in the trenches

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
with these women,
listening to their stories,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.090 align:middle line:84%
hearing their
cries, teaching them

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.060 align:middle line:84%
how to live a lifestyle
that matches their hormones.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I've even taken
them to supermarkets

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and shown them how
to read labels.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I've customized family
plans and detox them.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you that
our health care system has

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.465 align:middle line:90%
completely let us down.

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:01.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Amen.

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:02.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So about 10 years ago, I
decided that I needed to move

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
out of my clinic and get out
into the world to teach what I

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
was teaching inside
the walls of my clinic.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.130 align:middle line:10%
And I have to tell you that
when I'm going out there

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:10%
into the world,
women aren't just

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:10%
suffering through menopause
with hot flashes or belly fat,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720 align:middle line:10%
they are suffering with anxiety,
depression, irritability,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.770 align:middle line:10%
lack of joy.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:10%
They can't think straight, they
can't hold on to information.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And we just don't
have a solution.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:90%
So I created one.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:10%
I hired a team of researchers
to scour through PubMed.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:10%
Bring me the science.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:10%
Show me what we have that
can help what we can do

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.530 align:middle line:10%
lifestyle-wise to help women.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.790 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I found.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.380 align:middle line:84%
This one's going
to blow your mind.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:90%
We don't just lose two hormones.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't just lose
estrogen and progesterone,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
we lose dopamine, serotonin,
acetylcholine, glutamate, gaba,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:90%
oxytocin, BDNF.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Estrogen is a precursor
for serotonin, dopamine,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:90%
acetylcholine and glutamate.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Progesterone is a
precursor for gaba.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
We are losing 10 neurochemicals
after the age of 40.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:90%
And we're not talking about it.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So I then went to my
team of researchers.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
tell me what we got.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.120 align:middle line:90%
What can we do?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:84%
How can we support
all of these hormones

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:90%
and all of these neurochemicals.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I call it our
neurochemical armor.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I look
at the menopausal journey

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
is that you go flying into
40 and you're like packed

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.060 align:middle line:90%
with your neurochemicals.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:90%
And life's great.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
By 50, that armor
is completely down.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And somebody looks at you wrong,
a spouse says something to you.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe all of a
sudden, your husband's

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
breathing too loud in
the bed next to you.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:90%
And you want to kill him.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's a neurochemical
reason for that.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to start to
bring this understanding

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that this armor is coming down
and that we are different.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.870 align:middle line:84%
We are not the same person we
were at 35, at 45, and at 55.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
We are completely
different because we

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:90%
are neurochemically different.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
We think different, we act
different, we eat different,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:90%
we react to stress different.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:90%
And we deserve answers.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from
my team of researchers,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
we're still in this
process right now.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's blowing my mind.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.930 align:middle line:10%
Is that lifestyle-wise, we
have over 20 different things

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:10%
that we can be doing.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:90%
First, fasting.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:84%
When you put yourself
into a fasted state,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:90%
you're not just burning fat.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people come
to fasting to lose weight

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to ask you
to stay for mental health.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Because when you burn fat
and you make a ketone,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
you increase BDNF, you help
to upregulate serotonin,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:84%
you improve your
neuroplasticity of your brain,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
and you get a good dose of gaba.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:10%
So as estradiol is making
her exit out of your body,

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:10%
you can turn to fasting to
all of a sudden upregulate

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:10%
these other neurochemicals.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
This is why I'm so
passionate about every woman,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
but especially women over 40,
building a fasting lifestyle.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a neurochemical
system inside your body

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.110 align:middle line:90%
that is there to work for you.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.590 align:middle line:84%
You just hadn't been
told how to use it.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And most people are just looking
at fasting as a weight loss

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:90%
tool.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Second tool you have, exercise.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
When you dive into the
research on exercise,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
did you know HIIT
training, where

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing your
heart rate up and down,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.990 align:middle line:84%
15 minutes of HIIT
training improves

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.320 align:middle line:84%
neuroplasticity and
upregulates serotonin?

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Did you also know that
when you lift weights,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:84%
you break down muscles
and that creates

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
a metabolite that goes
up into your brain

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:90%
and also stimulates BDNF.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So where you might
have been working out

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:84%
at 35 to lose weight,
could you work out at 45

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:90%
to improve brain health?

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But that workout is going to
have to look really different.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
This is not about you getting
on the treadmill for an hour

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and going, this is
about you working out

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:84%
to support the
neurochemical loss that's

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:90%
happening inside your brain.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Did you also know that
if you go out and for

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
an aerobic activity,
for 10 minutes,

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:90%
you get a good dose of oxytocin.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you do that in the
sunlight without your glasses

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:84%
on, you're stimulating serotonin
receptor sites in your eyes

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:84%
so you're running, you're out
there, you're getting oxytocin,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:90%
you're getting serotonin.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.555 align:middle line:84%
And if you look straight
ahead and you scan the horizon

00:05:48.555 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
from right to left,
you're telling your brain

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
to calm down and relax, you're
running away from the predator.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:84%
1 10-minute exercise
can calm the fire

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:90%
within the menopausal brain.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:10%
We also know we've got yoga.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Specific movements
starts to take us out

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
of that sympathetic
drive that so many of us

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
live in and can put us over
into a parasympathetic state.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
But how many of us are going
to do yoga on a regular basis?

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
How many of us are leaning into
exercise as a mental health

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:90%
tool?

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Third thing we have, our breath.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
All of this is
backed by science.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.480 align:middle line:84%
We have different
ways we can breathe

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
to create a neurochemical
reaction in our body.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Like 4-7-8 breathing.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Something really simple.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
You breathe in through your
nose for 4, you hold it for 7,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and you exhale out
your mouth for 8,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and you've got some gaba.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So when progesterone
is making her exit

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.220 align:middle line:84%
and she's like I'm out, you
can be like, no problem.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
start doing 4-7-8

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
breathing so that I can help
myself up upregulate gaba.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:84%
We also know
something miraculous

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
as hyperbaric oxygen, when you
lie in one of those chambers,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
you're not just
chilling out and priming

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
your parasympathetic
nervous system,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
but that oxygen is
compressed oxygen.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it goes into the receptor
sites in the brain, the neurons

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that
estradiol used to stimulate

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and no longer is stimulating.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And you can't think straight,
and you can't focus,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.270 align:middle line:84%
you get in a chamber, and all of
a sudden, oxygen goes in there

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and does it for you.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Fourth thing we have is
connection and community.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Every time you go
out into the world

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and you smile at
somebody, you get oxytocin

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and they get oxytocin.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Every time we rally
around each other as women

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and we lean into each other
and we support each other

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and we raise each
other up, all the

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:84%
neurotransmitters I just talked
about-- dopamine, serotonin,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
acetylcholine, all
of those, based off

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of science, connection
and community

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and telling each other
amazing things, all of those

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:90%
get upregulated.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:84%
From human interaction
with each other.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:90%
We have so many solutions.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But we have a
cultural hush that's

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
been going on
where we don't want

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to talk about our
menopausal symptoms

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and we have to start coming
together and supporting

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:84%
each other and talking
about what's working

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and bringing our communities
together and collaborating,

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:90%
not competing.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the new
fascinations that I

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.020 align:middle line:90%
have is with the Okinawa women.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have a dream
that I'm going to go

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.653 align:middle line:90%
visit these amazing women.

00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:36.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:08:36.453 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:10%
And so one of the things
that the Okinawa women do

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.830 align:middle line:10%
is they create a moai.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:10%
And a moai is a group of
women that come together

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:10%
and share resources.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:84%
They share knowledge, they share
homes, they share families,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:84%
they share love,
they share play.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is in their
life is for the whole community.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
Here, in the Western
world, we don't do that.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:90%
We isolate ourselves.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
We bitch about our symptoms, we
start arguing about HRT, BHRT,

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:90%
what should we do?

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't come together and
create a loving, supportive

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So my rally cry to you today is
that we start forming a moai.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
That we start energetically
coming together

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and helping each other
even if we're strangers.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's a must at
this point in time

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
because we are living in
a world with a health care

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:90%
system that has left us behind.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.410 align:middle line:90%
