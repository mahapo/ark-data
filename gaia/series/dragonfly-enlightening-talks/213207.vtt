00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.840 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a recovering
professor of medicine.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.405 align:middle line:84%
I spent 20 years in academia,
training and teaching future

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:84%
physicians, and quickly
realized that the way

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.687 align:middle line:84%
we're delivering health
care today isn't working.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.270 align:middle line:10%
So it's really an
honor and a pleasure

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.998 align:middle line:10%
to be with you today, and really
get straight to the masses

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:10%
and teach you how to
take care of yourself.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.457 align:middle line:84%
Because it's clear
to me that physicians

00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and the American
health care system

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:90%
isn't taking care of anyone.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:90%
So I've spent, again, 20 years.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:84%
My research program
has been trying

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.020 align:middle line:84%
to answer four
fundamental questions.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
How does the human
body make nitric oxide?

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:84%
What goes wrong in people
that can't make it?

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
What are the clinical
consequences and symptoms

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:90%
that manifest?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Then how do we fix this.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So I've published over
100 peer reviewed papers.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Got several dozen
issued patents.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Given several hundred
lectures around the world.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:84%
So I've spent the past
20 years in the trenches.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I've ever
given a 10-minute lecture

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:90%
on nitric oxide.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.088 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
feel like you're

00:01:02.088 --> 00:01:03.375 align:middle line:90%
drinking from a fire hydrant.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But fundamentally,
what I want to share

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:84%
with you is that people get sick
for two reasons and two reasons

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
only: Your body is
missing something

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.798 align:middle line:84%
that it needs or it's exposed to
something that it doesn't need.

00:01:11.798 --> 00:01:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And mechanistically,
the end result of that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
is you decrease your body's
production of nitric oxide,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:84%
you get inflammation, oxidative
stress, and immune dysfunction.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.752 align:middle line:84%
Those are the hallmarks of
every single chronic disease

00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
from Alzheimer's, diabetes,
autoimmune disease.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So if we can understand
how to restore

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.185 align:middle line:84%
the production of nitric oxide,
give the body what's missing,

00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
eliminate from the body
what it doesn't need,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.500 align:middle line:90%
then the body heals itself.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.952 align:middle line:84%
We're regenerative
beings by nature.

00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to show you this
to show you that we can actually

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
look inside humans and
really look at the root

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:90%
cause of the problems.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And on the left, you
have a spec scan.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
So spec scans tell
us how well perfused

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.620 align:middle line:84%
the organ is, in this
particular case, the brain.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.500 align:middle line:84%
On the right, you've
got a former NFL player

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that has
post-concussion syndrome

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.455 align:middle line:84%
and chronic traumatic
encephalopathy.

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can see these
holes in the brain

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.218 align:middle line:84%
are reflective of
focal ischemia, which

00:01:57.218 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
means there's not enough blood
flow to that particular region

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.430 align:middle line:84%
They develop
neurological dysfunction.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Same thing happens
in a heart attack.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
If you have an
embolus or a thrombus

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
in the coronary arteries and
you don't restore the blood flow

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.935 align:middle line:84%
in a timely manner, then people
die or develop heart failure.

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But if you can restore the blood
flow, in this particular case,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
within 60 minutes,
you can maintain

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
normal physiological
function of the heart.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So no consequences or damage
from that heart attack.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.420 align:middle line:84%
If you go a little
bit deeper, you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.860 align:middle line:84%
can see that even neurons
from neuropathy, motor

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:84%
or sensory neurons have to
have adequate blood supply.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
The microvessels
that supply that,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:84%
when they become damaged
or dysfunctional,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
you develop neurological
disease or neuropathy.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:84%
So the whole point here is that
every single chronic disease

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
is characterized by
decreased blood flow.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
If you can restore
blood flow and perfusion

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to these organs,
tissues, and cells,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.850 align:middle line:84%
then you can correct
many conditions.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do this?

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the role of our
favorite molecule nitric oxide.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a gas.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.543 align:middle line:90%
It's produced in the body.

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Once it's produced, it's
gone in less than a second.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The challenge has been,
how do we recapitulate

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.260 align:middle line:84%
nitric oxide-based
signaling in a solid dose

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:90%
form of a bioactive gas?

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:90%
That's been my claim to fame.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But nitric oxide is
more than a vasodilator.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It's responsible
for oxygen delivery

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.030 align:middle line:90%
to every cell in the body.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:84%
When we breathe in oxygen, the
body produces nitric oxide.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Without nitric oxide, oxygen
does not come off, hemoglobin.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
We witnessed this for the
past 3.5 years with COVID.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:90%
People develop hypoxemia.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
You put them on mechanical in
100% oxygen, and they died.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:84%
If you just give
them nitric oxide,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
we can restore their
blood oxygen saturation,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
improve oxygen delivery,
and you keep patients out

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:90%
of the hospital.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It's involved in every
biological function.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the molecule
responsible for erections

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:90%
in both men and women.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.107 align:middle line:84%
You can't dilate the blood
vessels of the sex organs

00:03:37.107 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:84%
if you don't get an increase
in blood flow or engorgement,

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and you develop
sexual dysfunction.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
It's part of our
immune system, how

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.855 align:middle line:84%
we fight off invading pathogens
from viruses and bacteria.

00:03:45.855 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's the molecule that
tells our own stem cells

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.760 align:middle line:90%
to mobilize and differentiate.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So we don't lose
stem cells with age,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:84%
we lose the ability to
mobilize stem cells with age.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And broadly speaking, there's
three main objective measures

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:90%
of longevity.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
There's telomeres, the
ends of the chromosomes.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Shorter telomeres,
shorter lifespan.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Mitochondria, or Dave
talk about mitochondrium.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Every age-related
disease is characterized

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.040 align:middle line:84%
by decreased numbers of
mitochondria and dysfunctional

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:90%
mitochondria.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the mobilization
of resident stem cells.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:84%
And this unified theory of aging
that we put forth 20 years ago

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.385 align:middle line:84%
really allows nitric oxide
as the unifying agent

00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
because nitric oxide is what
controls all three of these.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Without nitric oxide, you
get shorter telomeres,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.370 align:middle line:84%
lower numbers of mitochondria,
and stem cells don't mobilize.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.320 align:middle line:84%
The older we get,
the less nitric oxide

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
we make, and this is responsible
for age-related disease.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.898 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the number one
killer of men and women

00:04:37.898 --> 00:04:39.693 align:middle line:84%
worldwide, which is
cardiovascular disease.

00:04:39.693 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
You lose the ability to produce
nitric oxide in the lining

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:90%
of the blood vessels.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Decades later or
years later, you

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
start to get the
structural changes, which

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:90%
we call atherosclerosis.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Then the plaque
becomes unstable.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
It ruptures, and that's
heart attack and stroke.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So mechanistically,
we've understood

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:90%
what causes arteries to age.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:84%
It's inflammation,
oxidative stress,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and immune dysfunction
nitric oxide controls

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:90%
and regulates all of those.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can usually
spend 45 minutes

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
on taking you through the
published science on this.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But in 10 minutes, I'll
just share with you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:84%
that this is what we've learned
scientifically over the past 30

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.075 align:middle line:84%
And there's two ways the
body makes nitric oxide.

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
There's an enzyme found in
the lining of the blood vessel

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that converts arginine
to nitric oxide.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is a five electron
oxidation reaction.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the pathway that we

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
can use through diet, which
explains a Mediterranean

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.310 align:middle line:90%
diet, the Japanese diet.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Every type of nutritional
epidemiological research

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
can be traced back to the
production of nitric oxide

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:90%
through that dietary pattern.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.632 align:middle line:84%
So when we lose the ability
to make nitric oxide

00:05:36.632 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
from both pathways, that's
when symptoms set in

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:90%
and we start to get sick.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of
nitric oxide products

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
on the market put forth
by companies who have

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.850 align:middle line:90%
no idea what the science is.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So as a biochemist,
we count electrons.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.415 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't count
electrons and apply this

00:05:50.415 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:84%
through the
oxidation of arginine

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:84%
or the reduction-- three
electron reduction of nitrate,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:84%
then you have no business being
in the nitric oxide space.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a study we
published years ago,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
showing that the older you get,
the less nitric oxide you make.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
But this doesn't
have to be the case.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.212 align:middle line:84%
We can prevent this
age-related decline

00:06:08.212 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
in nitric oxide
production because we now

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
understand the enzymology and
the biochemistry of nitric oxide

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to the extent that we
can repair it and fix it.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be 50 next week, but
I have the neovascular age

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:90%
of a 32-year-old.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a Scotch, drink and
meat-eating hell raising Texan.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have
to be this way.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So people ask me
all the time, how

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.010 align:middle line:84%
do I restore nitric
oxide production?

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And you only have
to do two things,

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:84%
stop doing the things
that disrupt it

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and start doing the
things that promote it.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And typically,
again, in detail--

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
but what we've discovered
is mouthwash use--

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
we published on this
about 10 years ago.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:84%
People use mouthwash,
kill the oral microbiome,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
shut down nitric
oxide production.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason we don't
take an antibiotic every day

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.155 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of our life
because of the destruction

00:06:49.155 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:90%
it does on the gut microbiome.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Why would we destroy the
oral microbiome every day

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:90%
with mouthwash use?

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.220 align:middle line:84%
200 million Americans wake up
every morning, use mouthwash.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:84%
There's 200 million
Americans that

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
have an unsafe elevation
in blood pressure.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:90%
This is not coincidental.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:90%
The other issue is fluoride.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride is a neurotoxin,
it's an antiseptic,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:90%
and it kills your thyroid.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride completely kills
the oral microbiome.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So you have to get
rid of fluoride.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Use fluoride-free toothpaste,
buy a home filtration system.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
There's fluoride in most
municipal water systems.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:90%
The other problem is antacids.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.290 align:middle line:84%
200 million prescriptions
written for proton pump

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:90%
inhibitors every year.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:84%
These drugs are now causing
40% higher incidence of heart

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:90%
attack, stroke, and Alzheimer's.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:90%
These are very dangerous drugs.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Your body cannot or will not
heal if you suppress stomach

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:90%
acid production.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:84%
You can't break down
proteins into amino acids

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and get peptide fragments
transported across the gut,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and you develop
autoimmune disease.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
In fact, antiacids are the root
cause of foodborne allergies

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:90%
and all autoimmune disease.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just common sense,
balanced diet in moderation.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big fan
of extreme diets.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Straight vegan,
straight carnivore.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we need nutrients
from a diverse source.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:90%
But certainly, sugar is a toxin.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:90%
Sugar is a poison.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.550 align:middle line:90%
We need to avoid sugars.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.178 align:middle line:84%
So once you do
that, now your body

00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:84%
is primed to actually generate
nitric oxide on its own.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:84%
But we can facilitate
that through

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
moderate physical exercise,
then with some more green

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:90%
leafy vegetables.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:90%
Infrared light.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of
infrared saunas.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
20 or 30 minutes
of sunlight a day.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
First sunlight in the
morning is very beneficial.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And then when all else fails,
we have product technology

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:90%
that does it for you.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.402 align:middle line:84%
So if your body can't
produce nitric oxide,

00:08:24.402 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:90%
then here's where we come in.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:84%
20 years of science and a number
of published randomized peer

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:90%
reviewed clinical studies.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.988 align:middle line:84%
But we made a solid dose
form of nitric oxide gas.

00:08:33.988 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the only technology
in the world where

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:90%
we generate nitric oxide gas.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:84%
If your body can't make
it, we do it for you.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But we also understand the
enzymology and the biochemistry

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.909 align:middle line:84%
that we can decouple
the NOX enzyme.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Now we're improving the
body's ability to make it.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And thereby, the
certain residence time

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of this lozenge in
the mouth, we're

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:90%
restoring the oral microbiome.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Most pathogenic
opportunistic bacteria

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:90%
are sensitive to nitric oxide.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:84%
The good, healthy,
commensal nonpathogenics

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:90%
actually produce nitric oxide.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So the lozenge, by
staying in your mouth

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.030 align:middle line:84%
for five to six minutes,
kills the bad guys,

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:84%
restores the diversity
of the oral microbiome.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.790 align:middle line:90%
And we do this.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.582 align:middle line:84%
We do this through a
fermented beet powder.

00:09:09.582 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
As you heard Dave said, most
beets don't do anything.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Turn your urine and
your feces pink,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and cause a lot of anxiety.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:90%
So we ferment a beet powder.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
We pre-convert it not relying
on the bacteria or the stomach

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:90%
acid.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And we regenerate
nitric oxide that way.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
We also have a
topical nitric oxide,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:84%
where we apply, for the
first time, nitric oxide

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.370 align:middle line:90%
directly to the skin.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It improves fine lines and
wrinkles, tone, texture,

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:90%
and clarity.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, the skin is an outward
reflection of internal health,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:84%
but we can actually
facilitate that.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Just like any
aging organ, it has

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
decreased blood flow, improved
collagen deposition, hydration,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:90%
fine lines and wrinkles go away.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:90%
So here are the facts.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
This take-home
message, beets do not

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:90%
equal nitrate save your money.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Most beets don't do anything.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Nitrate does not
equal nitric oxide.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a very
inefficient reduction

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
of this that's dependent
upon the oral microbiome.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Arginine and citrulline
products don't

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
work in patients with
endothelial dysfunction.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.822 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a number
of clinical studies

00:10:03.822 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
have shown if you give
arginine to a patient

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
with endothelial
dysfunction, they get worse.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.177 align:middle line:84%
So what to look for
in product technology.

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Is there evidence that the
product actually works?

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you quantify, detect, and
verify it produces nitric oxide?

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:18.622 align:middle line:84%
Published clinical
trials, most companies

00:10:18.622 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are never going to put
their dietary supplement

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:90%
through a clinical trial.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:90%
They're costly.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't work, they're
not going to move the needle.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.013 align:middle line:84%
And then has the inventor
formulate ever published

00:10:27.013 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:90%
original research?

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So don't be fooled by
creative marketing, science,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.880 align:middle line:90%
and experience matter.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
The greatest enemy of
knowledge is not ignorance,

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:90%
it's the illusion of knowledge.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:90%
So now we have no excuse.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.835 align:middle line:90%
Get the information.

00:10:39.835 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
conclusion, nitric oxide

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
controls and regulates blood
flow and oxygen delivery

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:90%
to every cell in the body.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.010 align:middle line:84%
There's an age-related decline
that asserts its effect

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:90%
on cardiovascular risk.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And we must use safe and
effective nitric oxide product

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:84%
technology in order to
optimize our health.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But point blank, your body
cannot and will not heal without

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.162 align:middle line:90%
nitric oxide.

00:10:57.162 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So with that, thank you very
much for your attention.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:90%
