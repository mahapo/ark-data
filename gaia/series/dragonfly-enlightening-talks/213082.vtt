00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Last year, I was lecturing
at an online conference full

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.180 align:middle line:84%
of a room of women
similar to yourself.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.730 align:middle line:10%
And the speaker
immediately after me,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.540 align:middle line:10%
a well-known ob-gyn, whom
I loved, absolutely adored,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:10%
learned a ton from, she
said, of all the hormones

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.690 align:middle line:10%
in the female body,
estrogen was her favorite.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, I was so excited.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:90%
I love estrogen. It's amazing.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
It does such good
things in the body.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
But the chat blew up full
of negative comments.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I have so many symptoms.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.100 align:middle line:84%
I know I have
estrogen dominance.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:90%
My PMS is the absolute worst.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't endometriosis-- isn't
that caused by estrogen?

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And then there were symptoms
and comments like this.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.580 align:middle line:90%
My mom went into menopause.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:84%
She took estrogen.
She got breast cancer.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
I will never take estrogen.
[SIGHS] Collective sigh.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it's pretty
safe to say estrogen

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:84%
is the most
controversial hormone we

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:90%
have in the female body.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But I'm here today to
help clear that up.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:90%
And I get it.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm a hormone doctor.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:90%
I know what they're saying.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.678 align:middle line:90%
I know what they meant.

00:01:22.678 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Heck, I am pretty
sure many of you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
have said the same thing at
certain points in your cycle

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
when you were frustrated with
all the hormonal things going

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.740 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe some of
you are menopausal

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and contemplating
going on estrogen,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:84%
but you've heard
super scary things.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Estrogen is not the villain.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
hero of our body.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, estrogen is
an umbrella term.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.560 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of estrogens in
our body, believe it or not.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we think about
estrogens, like I said,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
we have to think
of it as the hero.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And we have this really potent
estrogen known as estradiol,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:90%
or E2.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And estradiol is
important in our growth

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and development, our
reproduction, our cycle,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.520 align:middle line:84%
our bone strength, growth, our
digestion, our immune system,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
our skin, collagen formation,
our hair, our heart,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:90%
and even our brain.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
A couple months
ago, I was walking

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.040 align:middle line:84%
through the streets of
Barcelona with a notable doctor

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:90%
friend of mine.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And she works with a leading
female neurologist, Dr. Kellyann

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Niotis--

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:90%
leading female neurologist.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Niotis told her, if
we are not on estrogen

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
within two years of
going into menopause,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
the gray matter in
our brain shrinks.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, what?

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Who designed that?

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:90%
Who designed us?

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:90%
I would like a word.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I have a few things I
would like to talk about.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine if your
gray matter has shrunk--

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:84%
we don't generally like
shrinkage in the body.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
But if it shrunk, you're more at
risk for mental health issues,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
memory issues, brain fog issues.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't multitask
like you used to.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
One of my friends called
it the CRS syndrome--

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:90%
Can't Remember Shit.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're at risk for
things like dementia.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:10%
And that is actively
being studied

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:10%
by other female brain
researchers, such as Dr. Lisa

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:10%
Mosconi.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:10%
She wrote "The XX Brain."

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:10%
And she's soon to write
"The Menopause Brain."

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, I keep pointing
out female brain.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:10%
We've learned most
of that research

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:10%
has gone to the male brain.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
They get all the antiaging, all
the cardiology, all the brain.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:10%
But as the saying goes,
we are not small men.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm tall as hell,
but I'm not a small man.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
My brain and my hormones
are set up differently,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:84%
just like yours if
you're a female.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The good thing is, if you're on
estrogen within those two years,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%
the gray matter in your
brain doesn't seem to shrink.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:90%
But I get it.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:90%
You have PMS.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.829 align:middle line:90%
You have sore, tender breasts.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
You have digestive
issues and immune issues

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:90%
that go with your cycle.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:90%
You are moody.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:90%
You're depressed.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:90%
You're irritable.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.070 align:middle line:90%
You're crying.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's all
within the same 3 minutes.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Again, who designed us?

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I'd like a word.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And we get brain issues.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So why would anyone love a
hormone known as estrogen?

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Why would anyone
love this hormone?

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out we used to
love estrogen. So let me give

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:90%
you a little history lesson.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Back in 2002, this
stupid study was done

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
called the Women's
Health Initiative.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:90%
We shortened it to the WHI.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And in the Women's
Health Initiative,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
they announced to the world, if
you are on a combination hormone

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
therapy, you had an increased
risk for breast cancer.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Perimenopausal and menopausal
women all over the world

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
stopped their
hormones and panicked.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Rightfully so.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.537 align:middle line:84%
This was horrible
news, except there

00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of problems
with that study

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't
learn till later--

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
how it was run,
who they recruited,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
the history of those women, and
how they reported the facts.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:10%
Since that time, a
lot of researchers

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:10%
have gone back and
evaluated the study itself,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:10%
done additional research,
or evaluated women still

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:10%
part of the study and found, ah,
what was announced to the world

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:10%
was misleading or
downright false.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge revelation for us.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.333 align:middle line:90%
There was an estrogen-only arm.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
There were two
parts to the study.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.240 align:middle line:90%
So there was the combination.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It was a synthetic progestin,
and ethanol estradiol.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.610 align:middle line:84%
That what was
announced to the world.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.640 align:middle line:84%
If you were in the estrogen-only
part, just this part,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.770 align:middle line:90%
you had less breast cancer.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:90%
That didn't make the news.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:84%
That was not on the
cover of "Time."

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see it in
"People" magazine.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see it
anywhere in Yahoo.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Heck, I would have
accepted "Daily Mail."

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see it anywhere
that the estrogen only

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:90%
had less risk of breast cancer.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.423 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, researchers
are looking at that

00:06:29.423 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and coming out with
the same conclusion.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
In the estrogen-only arm, those
women have less breast cancer.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:10%
We have suffered badly for it.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Between all the symptoms
we get associated

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.130 align:middle line:84%
with estrogen and the
news that hormones

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.010 align:middle line:84%
cause breast cancer, what is the
message we get over and over?

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Estrogen equals bad.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have a dog.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:90%
He is the light of my life.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.880 align:middle line:84%
When my dog digs in the
backyard, is he bad?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:90%
He is not stimulated.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And I need to take
him for a walk.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
When my dog throws up
in the house, is he bad?

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.950 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
He just ate something
he shouldn't have.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And when my dog runs
through mud puddles

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.533 align:middle line:84%
and then runs back through
the house, is he bad?

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
That one we fully
blame my husband

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
on because he forgets
to wipe his feet.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
My point is,
hormones, like my dog,

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
react and interact with
everything in the whole world.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Your body.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.080 align:middle line:84%
We need things like
progesterone to go

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
with estrogen. Progesterone
is another hormone.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
It's our calming, soothing,
relaxing, zen hormone.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And if your
progesterone is supposed

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:84%
to be here but it's here
and estrogen is here,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:90%
you're out of balance.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:90%
But estrogen gets all the blame.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And estrogen goes through a
complex detoxification system.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:90%
It's two or three steps.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.410 align:middle line:84%
It starts in the liver,
usually, goes to the intestines

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
or the kidneys.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you have any issues
in any of those steps,

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
like a B vitamin deficiency
or constipation, guess what.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:84%
You can't get estrogen
out, just like

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
if you were taking trash to
the curb and somebody kept

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:90%
bringing it back in.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Yuck.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get symptoms.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd be
remiss if I didn't

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
talk about estrogen chemicals,
like endocrine-disrupting

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Estrogen and progesterone are
part of the endocrine system.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:84%
These are endocrine-disrupting
chemicals.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Stop disrupting the system.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.440 align:middle line:84%
The system acts estrogenic,
these chemicals do.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
They bind to receptors
and turn them

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:84%
on when you don't
want them turned on.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
they're in everyday items.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
They're in the plastic
lids on your coffee cups.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
They're in your scented
fragrance and your detergent,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:90%
your perfume, your lotion.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
They're in the forever
chemicals in the yoga pants

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:84%
pressed tightly
against your body.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's fair
or fun, but it's true.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And before you panic, it's
not all yoga pants, just

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:90%
some of them.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But my point is, we
can't single-handedly

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:90%
blame estrogen for everything.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:84%
A third to a half of our life is
going to be spent in menopause.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
If you are cycling,
depending where

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.910 align:middle line:84%
you are right now in your cycle,
if you've got a blood test,

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you'd be like at a
level 100, 200, 300.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:84%
In menopause, you
drop down to below 20.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:90%
That's a big drop.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It interacts with all
systems, almost all cells.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got hot flashes,
night sweats, the brain issues,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
heart issues, immune issues,
digestive issues, sleep issues.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:90%
You're depressed.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:20.410 align:middle line:90%
You're anxious.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:84%
You're not feeling as
connected as you used to.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
You're gaining weight
right here out of nowhere.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So when it's your time
to consider hormones

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
as you're going
through menopause,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:90%
please don't be misled.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:90%
Don't fall into the fear.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Realize there's a lot of
misinformation out there.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And like my dog, who is
my favorite in my family,

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
we cannot single-handedly
blame estrogen for everything.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.610 align:middle line:90%
It's complicated.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:90%
The body is complex.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a system.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.280 align:middle line:90%
It works as a unit.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And we can't forget
progesterone.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
When was the last time you
had your progesterone checked?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:90%
We can't forget estrogen detox.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:84%
When was the last time
you had that tested?

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And we cannot forget
the chemicals.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:90%
So estrogen is not the villain.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
hero in your body.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE, CHEERS]

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:90%
