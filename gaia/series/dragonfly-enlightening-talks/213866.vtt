00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:12.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are we?

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.380 align:middle line:90%
What are we?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:10%
What do we think of
ourselves that we are?

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:10%
I think most people think of
themselves as being solid.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.085 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much what you
notice in your daily life.

00:00:27.085 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting in a
car and, of course,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:90%
you're the solid meat bag.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
We have heard, though,
that we're not just solid.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:90%
So how does that all work?

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Behind the facade of this meat
bag, there's mainly water.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:90%
We kind of know that.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:90%
But we don't feel it.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:84%
On a molecular basis, I
have learned even over 99%.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But that's not where it all
starts because we're actually

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:90%
over 99% space.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people claim
it's empty space.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing behind it.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.150 align:middle line:90%
That's not the reality.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.480 align:middle line:90%
You all know that.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you wouldn't
perceive yourself.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.300 align:middle line:90%
We are a consciousness.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:90%
We're energy.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So this so-called empty
space is filled with energy.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So at core, we're all
energy and frequency.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the most
fundamental things

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:90%
to actually understand.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And it is a reflection
of the current times

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.100 align:middle line:84%
because we come out
of this so-called Kali

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Yuga, the Dark Age.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not really dark, but
it's all about the physical,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:84%
the material we forget and
we have forgotten who we are,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.620 align:middle line:90%
why we're here.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And as humanity, we're
going through a big shift

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:84%
right now, a big
consciousness shift

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
to remember that we are
energy and frequency.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
So if we are energy
and frequency,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:84%
couldn't we then also help
ourselves on that level?

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
We're trained to
take our vitamin C

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
pills or other supplements,
do physical exercise

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But what if we could also
help us energetically?

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Not saying to stop doing
all the things that help us

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
on a physical
level, but if we're

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:84%
energy and frequency
at core, shouldn't we

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.100 align:middle line:84%
be paying attention to
that and really nourish

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that huge part of us,
which is way bigger

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:84%
than just the material
that we show, that we see,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.970 align:middle line:90%
that we can touch?

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. David Hawkins many, many
years ago wrote a book called

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.510 align:middle line:84%
"Power Versus Force," where he
set up a consciousness scale

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
from 0 to 1,000, with
the low vibrational,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:84%
low consciousness states being
anger, shame, guilt, fear.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:90%
We kind of all know that.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.140 align:middle line:84%
If we're in these
states, we even

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
start to get angry
with ourselves.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what we're
inviting into our lives,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.680 align:middle line:84%
because we're vibrating
at a low level,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.325 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we
get into our lives.

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
We have heard maybe before
what you think you become, what

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.670 align:middle line:90%
you think you are.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So if we think in terms of fear
and anger and guilt and shame,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:90%
that's what we are.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:90%
That's how we feel.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So then on his
consciousness scale,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
if you move up the
ladder, it'll go to 500,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:90%
that's the unconditional love.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Then moving to 540, that's joy.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And then it moves into
the enlightenment zone,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:90%
which is quite a big zone.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So what if we raised our
consciousness in a way

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
where we start going away from
these low vibrational fields

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
so we can start inviting new
things into our lives, more

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:84%
wonderful things,
and at the same time,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:84%
also help not only our
energetic well-being,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
but really our
physical well-being.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And so the most fun part
actually about what we're doing

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
is not the technology
itself, it's

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
actually witnessing when
that happens to an individual

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
where there is either a medical
breakthrough, because there's

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
something on a physical level
that happens where you wonder,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
oh, my God, this is
almost like a miracle.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't expect this to
happen, yet it happened.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Or someone that thought, well,
all this energy crap, that's

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:90%
not-- it doesn't exist for me.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.180 align:middle line:84%
I need to see something
with my own eyes.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I need to touch something,
and then I believe it.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
That person completely forgot
that at core, this very person

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:90%
is energy and frequency.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So what if now this
person sees something

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
happening in his
her own life that

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.880 align:middle line:84%
is maybe life-changing,
that's very profound.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But it happened
through just energy?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
That's an amazing
point because that's

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
a crossroad where someone
wakes up to the fact

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
that there's more than
just the physical facade.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.080 align:middle line:90%
And I was there.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you that.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I married a wife who was
born with the ability

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:90%
to see our own energy fields.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So she never lost this
conscious connection.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
That's amazing because you have
skills, you can see energies.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:90%
It's just so natural.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But I would say 99.5%
of the people at least

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:90%
forgot all of that.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Like me, I didn't
believe in anything.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't touch.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.330 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't see.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I actually was very unhappy
in my lifelong time ago.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I
realized I discredited

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:90%
the intuition in others.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And that was because
I discredited

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:90%
the intuition in myself.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even allow my intuition
to play any role in my life.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
That was the moment
where I said, OK, I

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:90%
need to make changes.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I started to do yoga,
meditation, breathwork,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.950 align:middle line:84%
starting reading about these
things, got trained in past life

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
regression work in shamanic
and energy healing practices.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
I was actually doing
that in parallel

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to a quite successful
business career.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may know
that I used to be a vice

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
president at T-Mobile
running 14 countries,

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:84%
was a board member at a
multi-billion dollar company.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I could play that
role, very well, actually.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I can be very rational,
very maturely oriented.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:90%
That was not me, though.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:90%
That was a role I played.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I realized at some
point, I'm way more than just

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:90%
this role.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And then this vision came up.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
So what if we could tap into
this source energy in a way

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
where we can uplift
our own consciousness

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.380 align:middle line:90%
on a constant basis?

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:90%
And what can we actually do?

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we can do
meditation, we can do yoga,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:84%
we can do Tai Chi,
all these things,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
these are great,
because they all

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:90%
lift our consciousness level.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
After a session of
Tai Chi or yoga,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
you usually always feel
better than before.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you are at
balance with yourself.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
You're not in the yesterday and
in the tomorrow and all of that.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we can tap into this
by doing these exercises

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
or by using technology that's
now out there, that leverages

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.320 align:middle line:84%
natural, pure quantum
energy, you can actually

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.050 align:middle line:84%
lift your consciousness
level and actually

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.270 align:middle line:84%
way faster than
Dr. David Hawkins

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.110 align:middle line:84%
20 or 30 years ago was
foreseeing, way, way faster.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And with that, you can have
amazing, profound changes

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
on the physical, because if
the energetic system gets

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:84%
in really great state and is
expanded and very connected

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to the source, you
can improve your blood

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:90%
in a very significant way.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
You have suddenly cells that
work in an excellent way

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
where you can see even
scientifically proven

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:84%
with placebo-controlled
studies to see

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
in 85% to 100% acceleration
in wound healing.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
You can see the heart rate
variability optimized, and so

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:90%
much more.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
You put water under
such technology

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and you see its structure, you
can inform it with frequencies.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
If you take a vitamin
C pill, it goes

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:90%
through the digestive tract.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the end of the
day, what happens?

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
The information of the vitamin C
ends up in the core of the cell.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not the physical substance.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we're at core
energy and frequency,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.590 align:middle line:84%
we can also leverage
frequency medicine

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to take in information that
can bring systems that are

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:90%
out of balance into balance.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for your attention,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:90%
and connect with yourself.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:90%
