00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:13.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, everyone.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, you were at the right
place at the right time,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.710 align:middle line:90%
doing the right thing.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.260 align:middle line:10%
And the information you're
going to receive today

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:10%
is going to be profoundly
different than anything

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.040 align:middle line:10%
you've heard from anyone else.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
think about yourself,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:84%
because each one of you
are here because you're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:90%
health enthusiasts.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
You're enthusiastic
about living a long time

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
and having a high
quality of life.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.555 align:middle line:84%
Because we type in Google--
longest living people,

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's not very
exciting because they

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:90%
look really terrible.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the average age
span is 85 years old down to 75.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
So even in the mainstream up
to the health enthusiasts,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.160 align:middle line:90%
the average is still 75 to 85.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And I spent the last 20 years
learning a lot of amazing things

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:84%
from people like you who are
at these events, and gurus

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and sages and experts
all around the world.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I gained access to $90
million worth of revenue

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:84%
that we reinvested to learn
the truth about how to support

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:90%
your body to stay alive.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that all the
people I was learning from

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
were dying at the
average age of 75 to 85.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of them died at
58, one of them died at 70.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, there's
something we're missing.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And I came to the
realization that I

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:84%
didn't know, you don't know,
but there's knowledge out

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
there somewhere that will open
up a lock that will allow us

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a biological
age between 25 and 35

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and a structural age
between 25 and 35,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:90%
and retain that indefinitely.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And we already know about all
the things that we should do,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.810 align:middle line:90%
and so they're all great.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.227 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, all
the technologies,

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:90%
I love all of them.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
We spent like a million and a
half dollars on just technology

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But after $90 million in
20 years, it got so simple,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, it has
to be mathematical.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And it turns out that it is.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So just think about
yourself here for a sec.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
You are an average adult in
North America of an average body

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.963 align:middle line:84%
size, and you breathe 11,000
liters of air every single day.

00:02:18.963 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, well,
what is going to affect us?

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.422 align:middle line:90%
What is going to keep us alive?

00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But what's also
going to affect us?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
You have 5 liters of
blood in your body--

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.560 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.280 align:middle line:84%
You circulate 5 liters
of blood every 60 seconds

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:90%
to every cell in your body.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.050 align:middle line:84%
You pump 7,600 liters
of blood a day.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And this 11,000 liters of air
equates to 4 million liters

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
a year, 40 million
liters a decade.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
to a 20-year-old,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
you measure their
kidney function,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
the average 20-year-old
has 100% kidney function.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You go to a 60-year-old, and
the 60-year-old is down at 35%

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:90%
efficiency from a 20-year-old.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is messed up because
your kidneys and your liver are

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
what filter your blood that
you're pumping 7,600 liters

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
a day and you've only got
this 5 liters to work with.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And your blood production
facility, which is your body,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
it produces blood all the time.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But I found that it
doesn't produce enough.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Because why would a 60-year-old
have 35% kidney function versus

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.073 align:middle line:84%
a 20 at 100% average is because
the 60-year-old breathe 160

00:03:25.073 --> 00:03:27.990 align:middle line:84%
million liters of air
more than the 20-year-old.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And guess what's in your air?

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It is so insane the
world we live in.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
We're driving around in cars
with rubber tires on them,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and people think that it's
the pollution from the fuel.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's a problem.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
But they go to a battery-powered
car that now burns tires

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:90%
up twice as fast.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And when I started to do
the analysis on the tires,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.100 align:middle line:84%
I found out that in
2010, they produced

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
a study that showed there was
10 billion pounds of rubber

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.310 align:middle line:84%
dust made of rubber, cotton,
epoxies, resins, plastics,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.545 align:middle line:84%
microplastics, chemicals,
and metals into the air.

00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
one of thousands

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.678 align:middle line:84%
of different pollutants that are
nanoparticles that are floating.

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
You don't see any
rubber on the road.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a mile and a half
above every highway

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:90%
and you're breathing it.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And so just that one thing
alone, you start breathing it in

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.945 align:middle line:84%
and your body gets behind the
eight ball until you're at 60.

00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
You're still
looking pretty good.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Look at a person at 80
and tell me how they look.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.079 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So they start to go-- it's
like this downward thing.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
If you could go back
to a 20-year-old,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
like my friend here
in the audience,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and start then and
maintain that 20 years old,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.660 align:middle line:84%
you have to turn your body into
a high volume blood production

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.767 align:middle line:90%
facility.

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the blood that's
bringing it in and delivering it

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.000 align:middle line:84%
to every cell, it's
the blood that's

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be able
to carry it out.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't find out
the exact formula

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:90%
until I was 64 years old.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I just turned 65 in
June of this year.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And I started this raw
material intake into my body

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and I went through quite
the roller coaster.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:84%
For the first seven
months, my blood pressure

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
went from athletic-- which I
thought I was very proud of,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:90%
115 over 65.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I found out that my body is
totally filled with garbage.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.150 align:middle line:84%
All of my cardiovascular system,
which is 10,000 kilometers long,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
6,500 miles of cardiovascular
tubing, arteries, veins,

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and capillaries was hardened
because all these nano

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:84%
particulates I've been breathing
my whole life have now got

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
into the muscle walls
that made them stiff.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I found out my organs
were plugged up--

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:90%
oh, joy.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.268 align:middle line:84%
My blood pressure goes
from athletic to 180/120,

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:90%
which everybody thinks is high.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:90%
That's a mythology, by the way.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.257 align:middle line:84%
It's only high if I
hadn't done anything.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And it says, if you take
salt, your blood pressure

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:90%
is going to go up.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a total myth.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:90%
That is not true.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I am cranking 5 grams
of unrefined sea

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:84%
salt in 1 liter of water and
1 liter for 50 pounds of body

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:90%
weight.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm doing more than
three liters a day.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
My blood pressure goes up
for the first four months

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:90%
to 180/120.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Do I care?

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.615 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go to the doctor

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and take diuretics and
have them freak out on me.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm
producing more blood,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and therefore more blood going
through a stiffened system

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause
high blood pressure.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:90%
So, what?

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
After seven months, it's back
down to normal, like 130/90.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm
still drinking more

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and now it's down-- now
it's back to athletic.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So I go, interesting, drinking
salt water actually normalize

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
my blood pressure, turn my
cardiovascular system back

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
into a 25-something-year-old
because all the clean blood that

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I produced on high volume now is
gone into every cell in my body

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and pulled it all
out of my brain.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.670 align:middle line:90%
My brain function doubled.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I had my prostate,
which was enlarged.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.770 align:middle line:84%
The typical 64-year-old guy
with a prostate problem,

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:90%
urinary issues, low libido--

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:90%
that reversed in three months.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Only the first three
months, I noticed

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:90%
my prostate issues were gone.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And then your gut acid,
your hydrochloric acid

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
in your stomach, how
important is that?

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gets
gut issues as they

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
get older because their
hydrochloric acid quality goes

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess what hydrochloric
acid is made from?

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Sea salt. It's the
chloride minerals.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Hydrochloric is the key,
and you are a walking ocean.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So another mythology we're
told is you're 80% water.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:17.717 align:middle line:90%
You're not 80% water.

00:07:17.717 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Anybody give me some
water out of your body.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
If you cry a tear, it's like
one-third diluted saltwater

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:90%
from an ocean.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:84%
You're literally
a walking ocean.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Once I found out what the
only raw material that

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:84%
is biocompatible and
bioidentical and bioavailable

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.860 align:middle line:84%
to the body to use to produce
blood is the only one.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
You can't go to all these
other electrolyte products

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and do this.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
5 grams per liter

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:84%
and 1 liter for every 50
pounds of body weight.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I was 400 pounds, I
would still only do 3 liters

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
a day because I've
only got 5 liters.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So the average human is 150
to 170 for males, 100 to 120

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
for females, unless
you're a larger body size.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:90%
And so you just need that much.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And it costs $15 retail a month
for the best possible salt

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:84%
on earth that is
totally certified,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:90%
no microplastics, heavy metals.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:90%
It's got the proper assay.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not like from
the Himalayas.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
It's 99.6% sodium chloride,
which you don't want.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.765 align:middle line:84%
You want the full spectrum
and you add it to your body.

00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And your body goes
into high production

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and it completely
changes your life.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
It is the biggest
elephant in the room

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.945 align:middle line:84%
and it is the thing that
we've all been missing.

00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the mission now is to get
this out because I am a living

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:90%
testimony.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did I find
out about this?

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:90%
A friend of mine phoned me.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.055 align:middle line:90%
She was 67 years old.

00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:33.263 align:middle line:84%
I'd been sharing health tips
with her for five years.

00:08:33.263 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:84%
She goes, I've got
something for you.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
She goes, this is going
to be really weird.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.706 align:middle line:84%
And she never talks about
this stuff with me before.

00:08:38.706 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
But she said, I thought that
I had a hormonal problem.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
At 45 years old, she
got vaginal dryness.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:90%
And she went to the naturopath.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
They have millions of dollars,
a very wealthy family.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And she tried everything.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And she ran into this guy in
Peru at the beginning of 2022,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.640 align:middle line:90%
and she was referred to him.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said to her,
tell me your problems.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So she told him all the problems
about the vaginal dryness that

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.070 align:middle line:84%
never got fixed, by the way,
everything she tried to do.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, you don't have
any hormone problems.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Stop it.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:90%
You're dehydrated.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.730 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:84%
She goes, no, I'm
perfectly hydrated.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I drink 2 or 3 liters of water a
day and the best water in there.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
She goes, no, that's
what's killing you.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
That dehydrates you.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:84%
When you drink pure water, you
donate your precious minerals

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:84%
in your body to the
water and pee it out.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Go and get the salt water.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Within two months of her
drinking the protocol,

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.390 align:middle line:84%
she had vaginal lubrication
of a 21-year-old.

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And we would never talk
about that subject otherwise.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.687 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I think I've
tapped into something.

00:09:37.687 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that's
very interesting.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:90%
This is in April of 2022.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
So I just poured some
energy into the information,

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
found the right salts, made
sure it was the clean stuff,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:90%
started in October.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's been 14 months
and I have never

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:84%
dreamed that my body could be
this much advanced, because I

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:90%
had done so many things.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.828 align:middle line:84%
You think about $90 million,
that's a lot of money.

00:09:58.828 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And we earned that money
and we just put it back.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't take the money.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.075 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that this knowledge
that we were missing,

00:10:05.075 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and this is just
one of the keys.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:84%
There's actually two more keys
and I'm running out of time.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, you get the drift.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
important information

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:90%
I could ever deliver to anyone.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And the only way you find out
is when you do it yourself.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.195 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you.

00:10:18.195 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:90%
