00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.330 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.660 align:middle line:10%
>> The reality is that
we're all light beings.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.790 align:middle line:10%
You probably know
that hopefully by now.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.440 align:middle line:10%
And what I've started to
learn about in my backdrop

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:10%
is really I've always
studied ancient traditions

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:10%
and tried to make
modern technology.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:90%
My dad was a Silva instructor.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Anybody ever hear of
Silva, the Silva method?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate enough to
be brought up on that method

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.482 align:middle line:84%
and learned at a very
early age what to do.

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So I want to share with you
some of the things that I think

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.210 align:middle line:84%
are really important, especially
for this day and age, what's

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
going onto us, because we're
at a war for our brain.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And people are trying
to take it over.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.818 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening
at a quantum level.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not happening
at the level where

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:84%
you think physically,
mentally, or emotionally

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:90%
where you should be.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.302 align:middle line:84%
So we all have something
called a brain,

00:00:54.302 --> 00:00:56.510 align:middle line:84%
and most people have never
been taught how to use it.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:84%
We think the world
happens to us.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
The reality is the world
happens through us.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:84%
You are less solid
than you are space.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And where you really
live is right here.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:90%
We have 40,000 neutrino cells.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.297 align:middle line:90%
That's your heart brain.

00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that
controls the whole show.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in a
state of fight or flight,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.865 align:middle line:84%
which is a survivor brain,
you can't make good decisions.

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if most people took a
stress test that we used to give

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
in the '70s and '80s, they
would not make a decision at all

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
It used to be, hey, if
you're changing your job,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
you're getting a divorce,
whatever's going on,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to not make decisions

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:84%
until all those
things are resolved.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're all being hit
with stress all the time,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
so we need to have
ways to handle that.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Mike Tyson said it best.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:84%
He said everybody has a
plan until they get hit.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So what are you doing
when you get hit,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and every day that happens?

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So most people are running
around in their primitive brain,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
trying to make
decisions, trying to act,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:84%
but we're living in
a whole new reality.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Most of you might not
know this, but right now,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:84%
as we're sitting here, you
are an 810-nanometer light

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:90%
generating machine.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
810-nanometer light
is infrared light.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:84%
When you walk into the
room with somebody,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.840 align:middle line:84%
you are photically changing
and exchanging information.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
They say communication
is 87% nonverbal,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
we now know that some
of that information

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.760 align:middle line:84%
is being exchanged through
biophotic exchange.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
That also happens at
the cellular level.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you are under
stress, your energy diminishes.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So think of it like
what's happening right now

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:90%
in the world with stress.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:10%
It's like having a
bonfire and somebody put

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.642 align:middle line:10%
wet leaves on top of it.

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
The fire is still
smoldering under there,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.618 align:middle line:84%
but it's not as big and
bold as it should be.

00:02:35.618 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:10%
And the reality is that you
are far greater than people

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.912 align:middle line:10%
have told you about.

00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:84%
You just don't know
how to activate that.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:90%
So the most under--

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.540 align:middle line:84%
the nutrient that most
people don't know about

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and is under
prescribed is light.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of light
vendors over there,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
but we need to get
light into our body

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.608 align:middle line:84%
because every cell
needs that light.

00:02:52.608 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Every cell of your
body has something

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
called a chromophore, which
is a little battery that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.000 align:middle line:90%
absorbs energy.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:84%
It absorbs it through
light, sound, and vibration.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
When you're scared, you don't
care about the environment

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:90%
anymore, you're fleeing.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So all those
sensory systems that

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:84%
are in the body that
are absorbing energy,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.220 align:middle line:84%
stop absorbing energy and
go just into survivor mode.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you get locked into
that mode, you can't heal.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you're thinking about
getting on your computer,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.010 align:middle line:84%
especially first thing in
the morning, a lot of people

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of bad things
to say about blue light.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.833 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it's BS I'm
going to tell you

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:26.833 align:middle line:84%
right now, because if we
didn't have blue light,

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
everybody would have
seasonal affective disorder.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:90%
We need blue light.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we don't need
as much of it as at night

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and we don't need the
bad light that's on right

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:90%
now with all the things.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
When you think about
ancient traditions,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.510 align:middle line:84%
how did we come
down from the day?

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you get up in the
morning, the light of the sun,

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
it wakes you up because it
triggers norepinephrine,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.190 align:middle line:90%
dopamine, and cortisol.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.223 align:middle line:84%
You don't run out to the
kitchen and get coffee.

00:03:51.223 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's
probably the worst thing

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
you can do first
thing in the morning.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
your brain knows

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:84%
you're going to do its work for
it, it stops doing its work.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So we need to figure
out ways to do that.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why people say you
shouldn't look at your phone

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:90%
first thing in the morning.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.268 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is you shouldn't
put any biologics into your body

00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
either other than water
and minerals, maybe.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.022 align:middle line:84%
So when you're thinking
about what's going on,

00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
how you start your
day, there's a saying,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.057 align:middle line:90%
win the morning, win the day.

00:04:14.057 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to follow
me around in the morning,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:90%
I take 3 hours to do my thing.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I really pamper
myself in the morning.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And I started a long time ago
studying with Yogi Bhajan.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
We'd get up at 3:30 in
the morning and do yoga.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.198 align:middle line:84%
So Yogi Bhajan is
not around anymore.

00:04:27.198 --> 00:04:29.115 align:middle line:84%
I don't live in Phoenix,
so I do my own thing.

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I get up and do all
my little biohacks.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And I have a good friend
of mine came over.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, you know, you
should train all your doctors

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
to have just what you have
up in your upstairs bedroom.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.888 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a big room that
we have with a pool table,

00:04:39.888 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:84%
but it's also got you walk
around and you do a 3-hour

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:90%
routine up there.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I know that my body
needs some help.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm now a young age
of 62, and I plan

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:90%
on being around for a long time.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:90%
But we've got to feed ourselves.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We can't feed ourselves
by feeding ourselves

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:84%
negative thoughts,
negative emotions.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The average person has 80,000
thoughts a day and over 90%

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:90%
of them are negative, they say.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
So depending upon what
book you're reading.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
of our upbringing.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Not our upbringing here today,
but our genetic upbringing.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
You are the sum total of every
person in your genetic lineage

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
back to the very
beginning of time.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's resonating,
vibrating, and teeming

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:90%
with energy inside of you.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And that resonant
frequency unlocks that code

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:90%
of who you are in that moment.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you're meditating, it's
not about you at that moment.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
It's about how are you going
to interface with the field.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Our NIH actually 4 years ago
said we have a biosphere.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
They actually admitted that we
have an energy field around us.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:90%
The medical community did.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
That biosphere is what
you're calming down

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
because when you walk
into the room, guess what?

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:84%
They can read your HRV
from 18 feet away now.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
You are showing up in
the room that you're

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
going into before you
arrive physically.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Your spirit or your
energy is ahead of you.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:90%
So we need to calm that down.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.242 align:middle line:84%
When we think of how they
did it in the ancient times,

00:06:00.242 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
when you would have stress,
because imagine waking up

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, your whole
job is to go gather or hunt.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.855 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, maybe
you did it, maybe you didn't.

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you were fasting that day
because you didn't get the hunt

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:90%
or you didn't find the berries.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:84%
But at night, what
would they do?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
They'd have a drum circle
or they'd have a fire.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is that fire doing?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
How many people have ever
been mesmerized by a fire?

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.190 align:middle line:84%
That fire is actually resonating
at 10 Hertz frequency.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:90%
10 Hertz happens to be alpha.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Every fire.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I still remember going into
AIIMS Bhopal and Dr. Varun said,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, Patrick,
you're cheating

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
when you're teaching people to
meditate with those goggles.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.322 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean?

00:06:38.322 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:10%
He goes, well, we took a guru
up on stage and we imitated.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.692 align:middle line:84%
I took a guru's brain map,
and then I took somebody

00:06:43.692 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
who had never meditated and
had them do a brain tap session

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:90%
that matched that brain.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.530 align:middle line:90%
He said, they cheated.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.655 align:middle line:90%
They didn't even meditate.

00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:90%
They didn't practice.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.613 align:middle line:84%
I said, that's because the
body learns differently

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:90%
than you think.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.790 align:middle line:84%
The body learns through
vibratory information.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.110 align:middle line:84%
You know everything
in the universe.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:84%
You just don't
have access to it.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:90%
So how do you get access to it?

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
The rishis will tell you
it comes from being still,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
getting into the
field, relaxing.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.390 align:middle line:84%
So as you think about it, when
you think about sunlight--

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and your eyes, by the
way, when people say,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
why do you have
lights in the eyes?

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes have more
mitochondria per centimeter

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:90%
than any other part of the body.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And that mitochondria
is designed

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:90%
to absorb and transmit light.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.100 align:middle line:84%
That's your
metabolism, by the way.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:84%
The more your metabolism can
absorb light and transmit light,

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:90%
the higher your metabolism.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.762 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
energy, you don't absorb

00:07:35.762 --> 00:07:36.720 align:middle line:90%
and you don't transmit.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.345 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
people in our lives.

00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:90%
We call drainers.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:10%
Some people call
them energy vampires

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:10%
because they don't
have enough energy,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:10%
so they seek out
people with energy

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:10%
to get that energy
because they know it.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:84%
You want to be the person
that walks in the room

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and gets a little
brighter, not the person

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that walks in the room
gets a little dimmer.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's because you have
to floss your own cells,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:90%
just like we floss our teeth.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:84%
You need to tune it up
every day because people

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:90%
are coming after you.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But we have the protection
necessary because when you're

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:90%
blowing out that energy--

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and that energy
starts from the heart.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:10%
During COVID, they
did a study that

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:10%
showed people who were in a
state of gratitude and peace

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:10%
and love were projecting 200
times more light from their body

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:10%
than--

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.360 align:middle line:10%
they call it luminescence.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It's in our cells, every cell.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:90%
They measure it now for beauty.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is it's
actually who we are.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
When you see somebody
go, you're glowing.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:90%
That's because they are glowing.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:90%
You're glowing.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So we need to tune in
to that light source.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we get it.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Fires do it when
you're by the ocean.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Music can do it.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.520 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever
meditated to music,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.895 align:middle line:84%
get into what they
call the Mozart effect.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
When you get your
body into sync,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
you can get energy from
music, sound, vibration.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:90%
So feed your frequencies.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:90%
Think of your environment.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:84%
It's all about you being
in-sync with your environment.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you are,
your field expands.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you get into stress, we
now know your field restricts.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.185 align:middle line:90%
So we want to expand our field.

00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:84%
When I say I want to
better a billion brains,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
imagine there's something called
the Maharishi effect where

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
they did, they prayed and they
meditated and they changed

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
in 41 different studies,
empirical evidence

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.670 align:middle line:84%
that they changed Washington,
DC prison systems, school

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.725 align:middle line:84%
systems just by a group of
people like-minded praying.

00:09:16.725 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So imagine every
morning when you

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
meditate not just for
yourself, but for the world.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about here.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, we can't always go
to the ocean but what we can do

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
is your brain doesn't know
the difference between real

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.487 align:middle line:90%
or imagined.

00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
ancient traditions,

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
we would have traditions, go to
the ocean, go to the mountains.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the ocean,
it's 10 Hertz frequency.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:90%
That's alpha.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Alpha gives you a gamma
spike and a delta spike.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.642 align:middle line:84%
That means that your brain
now regulates itself.

00:09:42.642 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why going to the
ocean, when people say,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:84%
I love the ocean,
acetylcholine is

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
released, different,
other neurotransmitters.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
The other is when you
go to the mountains,

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
you're going to release Gaba.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Varun,
do you know why

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.350 align:middle line:90%
the gurus go to the mountains?

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:84%
He goes, because they
want to be alone.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.677 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, they're cheating.

00:09:58.677 --> 00:09:59.760 align:middle line:90%
He goes, what do you mean?

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.343 align:middle line:84%
I said, when you sit
in the mountains,

00:10:01.343 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:90%
it's 7.8 Hertz frequency.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting
in a gamma field.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So now their body creates gamma,
so we're going to fake that out.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, today we have technology.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:90%
It's over here.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.480 align:middle line:90%
You can play with it.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It's all over here
because the quantum world

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:90%
is opening up for all of us.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.173 align:middle line:84%
We're all quantum beings and
we're not here by accident.

00:10:21.173 --> 00:10:23.465 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to encourage
you to be part of the mission

00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
to better a billion
brains and help

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
us to change the world by
changing yourself first,

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
of course, and then
changing the world.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.760 align:middle line:90%
