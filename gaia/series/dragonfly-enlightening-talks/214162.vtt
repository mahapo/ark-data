00:00:07.856 --> 00:00:12.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine gaining
25 pounds in a month.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't from
eating pizza and brownies

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.310 align:middle line:90%
and drinking your wine.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:10%
You're eating chicken, broccoli,
asparagus, going to the gym

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:10%
at least once, sometimes twice
a day, and nothing is working.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
You start to not even recognize
the woman you see in the mirror

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:90%
You become depressed.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:90%
You start to self loathe.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You start to question
yourself a little bit.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to go out.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to get dressed.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Your friends and family have
no idea what's wrong with you.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You fall deeper and
deeper into depression.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:90%
You need help.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:90%
So you go to your doctor.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what we do.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.770 align:middle line:90%
There they are.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
You got a doctor number 1,
who tells you you're normal.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Doctor number 2, eat
less and exercise more.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Three, it's all in your head.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:90%
4, 5, 6.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Doctor number 7 does something
a little bit different.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Touches your neck
and says, swallow.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
She says you have
hypothyroidism.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:90%
You have Hashimoto's.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.490 align:middle line:90%
There's a nodule there.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to give you a pill.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And you leave that office
and you are pumped.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Now you have a pill.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:90%
You have an answer.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:90%
You have a diagnosis.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Things will change.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:90%
And you give it five months.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.810 align:middle line:90%
No change.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:90%
No weight loss.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel better.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.810 align:middle line:84%
You keep hearing the name
of this functional medicine

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
practitioner, how
she helps people.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:90%
So you try doctor number 8.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:84%
You say this is going
to be my last resort.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:90%
You meet with her.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And she actually sits down with
you for an hour and a half.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:10%
Does all of these labs.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Looks at you as a human being
and not just a lab value,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.860 align:middle line:90%
and asks you, how do you feel?

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:90%
And she listens.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
She gives you the right
thyroid hormone replacement,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
the right supplements,
the right diet.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:84%
She cares whether or
not you poop every day.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
She does not
medically gaslight you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and make you think
that it's your fault

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:90%
and that you're crazy.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:90%
And you finally lose the weight.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And you get to do your happy
dance because it's working.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:90%
And you like sex again.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:90%
That was me back in 2001.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I was competing in multiple
fitness and figure competitions.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:90%
I was fitness modeling.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:90%
And my body rebelled against me.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:90%
That's me now.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:90%
That was me then.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I do not have any in-between
pictures because I was ashamed.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I felt judged.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:90%
She's eaten too many donuts.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
I blamed myself for
what my body was doing.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
But from that point on, when
I got the answers, I said,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
no other woman will ever
go through this again.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:84%
We need to demand, no more
of the same treatment.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:90%
You can have fat loss.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:90%
That is easy.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.100 align:middle line:90%
It can be done.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to talk about
that today as we incorporate

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:90%
in the thyroid.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.758 align:middle line:84%
But we got to blow up
some common beliefs first

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:90%
about metabolism and fat loss.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.082 align:middle line:90%
Healing your gut is wonderful.

00:03:45.082 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
only thing that's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:90%
going to make you lose weight.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Eating less and
exercising more is not

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:90%
going to make you lose weight.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And even all that cardio
and LHS, Lift Heavy Stuff,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
is not going to make
you lose weight.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
But optimizing your
thyroid, your testosterone,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:90%
your insulin levels will.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
talk to thyroid today

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
because the thyroid gland
is your master gland.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:90%
It runs the show.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:90%
It runs your entire body.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It gives you energy,
metabolism, drive, motivation.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.060 align:middle line:84%
It clears your brain,
makes you feel good.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you have symptoms
of low thyroid function,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
you have many problems--
from the weight gain

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you do, the
brain fog, the hair loss,

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:90%
the joint pain.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
talking thyroid, we

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
need to talk about those
key hormones for thyroid.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:90%
First, there's T3.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:90%
T3 is the gas.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the gas in your engine.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
That's what's running the
show, running your metabolism.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
We have reverse T3
Those are the brakes.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
That puts the
brakes on your body.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It puts your body
into survival mode.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.700 align:middle line:90%
And then we have T2.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like a stick of dynamite
for your mitochondria.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
A stick of dynamite for
your basal metabolic rate.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:90%
And all of these work together.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.910 align:middle line:84%
T3 and T2 make you that badass
woman that you're meant to be.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:90%
We need to know what they are.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:90%
We need to know your values.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the thing.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
We want you in
the optimal range.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:90%
We want to test to not guess.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I want you optimal.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Free T3, when we test
that, we actually

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.112 align:middle line:84%
want that in the upper
quadrant of the range.

00:05:30.112 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:10%
I don't care where
you live in this world

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.142 align:middle line:10%
or what lab you
go to, I want you

00:05:34.142 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:10%
in that upper
quadrant of the range

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:10%
because the standard
lab value range is taken

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:10%
from a group of sick people.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's a problem.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Functional medicine
says, give me your fit,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
give me your biohackers, give me
the badasses, let's test them.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Then we get that
optimal lab value range.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.610 align:middle line:10%
It's a little bit more
narrow, but that's

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:10%
where I want you to be.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Reverse T3, the brakes.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's test your brakes just
like a car, let's test them.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Lower quadrant of the
range, less than a 12.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:90%
My UK peeps, you're the same.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Less than 12.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
T2, there's actually no
commercial test for it.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:84%
We just take it, and
we reap the benefits.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have to
test to not guess.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:84%
TSA, free T4, free T3,
reverse T3, your brakes.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
TPO and TGA antibodies, that's
what tells me whether or not you

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:90%
have Hashimoto's.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.268 align:middle line:84%
It tells me whether
or not you have

00:06:27.268 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
soldiers in you that like to
go out and beat up your thyroid

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:90%
gland.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
We want to know the amount
of soldiers you have

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
because we want to keep
them in their barracks

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and keep them from
starting a war.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And we want all of those numbers
optimal, not just normal.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you resonate
with those symptoms.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you go out and
you get all of those tests.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:90%
What can you do?

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you need thyroid
hormone replacement.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:90%
This is personalized medicine.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
This is thyroid hormone
replacement that fits you.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need to give you
a little bit of T3 and T4.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
That pill I was
given, that was T4.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Here's the problem.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:84%
T4 has to convert over
to T3 to be active.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't converting.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:84%
This is where caring and asking,
how do you feel comes in.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
I want you on the right
thyroid hormone replacement

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:23.877 align:middle line:90%
that's right for you.

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I get the question all the time.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
What medication do you like
the best in the thyroid world?

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that's going to
work for you, in the dose that's

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:90%
going to work for you.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Then we have gluten-free.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Gluten-free is not just a fad.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Gluten actually looks
like the thyroid gland.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So you know those
little soldiers,

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
they like to go out
and start a war.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you eat gluten,
your soldiers amp up.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:84%
They go, hey, there's
an invader coming in.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Let's go get them.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And they go out and they
attack your thyroid gland.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's going to happen
if I beat you up every day?

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Not cool.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to feel great.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to work well.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to be productive.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Same with your thyroid gland.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there's T2, 3,
5, Dieto, L-theanine.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:84%
This raises your
basal metabolic rate.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It actually works at
the mitochondrial level

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:90%
to produce more ATP.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So that fatigue that you feel
from low thyroid function,

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.250 align:middle line:90%
T2 can help that.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:84%
That weight gain that you
get, T2 can help that too.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Powerful hormone.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And then Keto, carnivore,
black cumin seed oil.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Why do I have all
those together?

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:90%
They're anti-inflammatory.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
We want to take down the
inflammation in your body

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:84%
so that your thyroid
can work better,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:84%
so those soldiers stay
in their barracks.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Black cumin seed
oil actually has

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
been shown to lower thyroid
antibodies in Hashimoto's

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.670 align:middle line:90%
upwards of 200 points.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:90%
And we have seen this reduction.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:90%
So we lower that onslaught.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:90%
We lower the attack.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:90%
We lower the inflammation.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And now, your thyroid
hormones work better,

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.270 align:middle line:90%
and you work better.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So as women, we have to stand
on no more of the same--

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:90%
no more of the same treatment.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:90%
We demand more.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
We deserve more because better
thyroid and better hormones

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:90%
equals a better life.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:90%
