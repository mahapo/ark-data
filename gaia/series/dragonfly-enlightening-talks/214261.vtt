00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.760 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm steps away from my car
when it feels like the ground

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.220 align:middle line:10%
beneath my feet starts
to tilt. My eyes close,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:10%
my head falls back, and a wave
of dizziness washes over me

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:10%
so intensely that
I almost pass out.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.470 align:middle line:90%
My head feels like a balloon.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Desperate for relief,
I stumble to my car,

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:84%
reaching for that granola bar
stashed in the center console

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
because, after all, I never
leave my house without snacks.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I was just leaving my
doctor's appointment,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:84%
my 12th visit that year, in a
desperate attempt to try to get

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to the root of my hormonal
dysregulation PCOS--

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:90%
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I could not figure out why I
couldn't get rid of my PCOS,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.075 align:middle line:84%
and after 12 doctor's visits,
I still had no answers.

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:04.360 align:middle line:84%
So I realized it was up to
me to figure this all out.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So I went back to
the drawing board,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
listened to every
podcast I could,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
read every Instagram
post and blog and book

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that I could get
my hands on, only

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.620 align:middle line:84%
to find no answers
that truly worked.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I was stumped and
I was hopeless.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And finally, one day I'm driving
in my car and I hear someone

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:90%
say--

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:90%
wow, I'm emotional--

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.330 align:middle line:84%
PCOS is the diabetes
of the ovaries,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and I just about drove my
car right off the road.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Diabetes of the ovaries, OK.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I think to myself, what
do we know about diabetes?

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, something
about blood sugar.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know anything
about blood sugar.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm being honest, I
never really associated myself

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
with being someone who had
blood sugar issues, insulin

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:84%
issues, and no one in
my family had diabetes,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't think I had
to pay attention to it.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't
know was hurting me.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:84%
I finally realized that everyone
has to care about their blood

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:90%
sugar.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
According to the CDC, more than
1 in 10 people in the United

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:90%
States-- adults--

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:90%
have type 2 diabetes.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:84%
About 38% of people
have prediabetes,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:84%
but 1 in 3 of those people
don't know that they have it.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And alarmingly, a new
study showed that over 88%

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
of adults in this country
are metabolically unhealthy.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
That's almost 9
out of 10 people.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
That means that they
have issues already

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:90%
with blood sugar and insulin.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Caring about blood sugar
is not just for diabetics.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Caring about blood
sugar is for everyone.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And we can't wait
for our doctors

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
to catch this because,
unfortunately,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
our mainstream
medical system, they

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:84%
teach doctors to look for
the presence of disease

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and then to give medications to
mitigate some of those symptoms.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But blood sugar issues are
driven by diet and lifestyle.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
medications or pills

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.130 align:middle line:90%
that we can take to fix this.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we go to our doctor and
get our fasting blood glucose

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
numbers tested every
year, as they do,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
your doctor will tell you,
anything under 100 is fine.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's not fine.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Research shows that
if our blood sugar is

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
below 70 or above 85
fasting, there's already

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.380 align:middle line:90%
signs of a problem brewing.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:90%
My blood sugar was 60.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Not one of those doctors
said anything to me.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder why
I almost passed out.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So this month happens to be
Type 2 Diabetes Awareness Month.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And what's missing
from that conversation

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.630 align:middle line:84%
is what's happening before
we develop diabetes.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.865 align:middle line:84%
Type 2 diabetes takes
decades to develop.

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
But no one is talking about
what these early signs are.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:84%
We can't keep taking
this reactive approach.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to take a proactive
approach to our blood sugar,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.925 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that begins
with learning the early signs.

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So as I'm learning
about my blood sugar,

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked as to
how much our blood

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.710 align:middle line:84%
sugar impacts every single
aspect of our health.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Our blood sugar affects how
we feel in the here and now

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and has huge impacts on
our long-term health.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's because our blood
sugar impacts every single cell,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:90%
organ, and process in our body.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Processes like hormone
balance, sleep, energy, hunger.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And so if our blood sugar
isn't working for us,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:84%
it is absolutely
working against us.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm learning
about blood sugar,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and I start to realize,
oh, my goodness,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
so many of the
things that I thought

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
were personality traits
and these little labels

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I gave myself were actually
blood sugar issues.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:90%
So I was the hangry friend.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:90%
I was a snacker.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:90%
I was a grazer.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I used to carry a
granola bar wherever

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:90%
I went because I was a foodie.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And I also used to say, I
don't have a sweet tooth.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:90%
All my teeth are sweet.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.450 align:middle line:84%
But just because something's
common doesn't mean it's normal.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So the earliest signs
of blood sugar issues,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
they start to show
up when we're hungry

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.580 align:middle line:84%
or if a meal is a little
delayed or missed.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And these symptoms can feel
like a lot of different things,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:84%
but some of the main
ones are feeling dizzy,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:90%
shaky, lightheaded, anxious--

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:84%
real big one-- feeling brain
fog, difficulty concentrating,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
nausea, heart palpitations,
headaches, cravings, hunger,

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:90%
irritability, impatience, pain.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:10%
There are so many of
these early symptoms

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:10%
that maybe we might tend
to grab a cup of coffee.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we take an ibuprofen.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
We're medicating
down these symptoms.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
So you see our, blood sugar--

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:84%
we have to think about
it like Goldilocks.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Our blood sugar, our body
doesn't like it too high.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't like it too low.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It likes it just right.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So if our blood sugar
is spiking super high

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.097 align:middle line:84%
and crashing super low,
our body hates that.

00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to send us all
those symptoms that I just

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.310 align:middle line:90%
told you about.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And those symptoms
are going to drive

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
us to go get quick
energy because it

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:90%
thinks we're lacking in energy.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.997 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to say, hey,
go to the next Starbucks,

00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:49.590 align:middle line:84%
go to the next drive-through,
hurry up, get something.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it puts us
back on that blood sugar roller

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:90%
coaster.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We're spiking and
crashing again.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is the only ride
I never want to be on.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But instead, our body
loves stable blood sugar.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Not too high, not too low.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.780 align:middle line:84%
This is what will help us to
feel good in the here and now

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:84%
and also help to promote
long-term health.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So as we spike and crash our
blood sugar over and over

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.220 align:middle line:84%
again-- this happens
to us all the time--

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and as the years go on, the
symptoms of blood sugar issues

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
then start to
become more severe,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and more bodily systems
start to become impacted.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
cumulative effect

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.810 align:middle line:84%
of these blood sugar issues on
our body and our physiology.

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
We start to see
a lot of symptoms

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.540 align:middle line:84%
in some different areas, and
some of those include big time

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%
our brain, which is a
main consumer of energy.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
So we have energy crashes.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't have energy at all.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
We have brain fog, we
have anxiety, depression,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:90%
or mood disorders.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And we also struggle with
this brain fog and difficulty

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:90%
forming memories.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And Alzheimer's is now being
called type 3 diabetes.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:90%
There's hunger issues.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:90%
We feel insatiable hunger.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:90%
We never feel full.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
We need that little piece of
chocolate right after we eat,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
we have cravings, and
maybe we even binge eat.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:84%
That was something I
struggled with as well.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.260 align:middle line:90%
There are weight issues.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Blood sugar issues can
make us hold on to weight,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.320 align:middle line:84%
not be able to lose weight
no matter what we do.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Also, another issue
I struggled with.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And it also can cause us to
put on visceral fat, which

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:90%
is that dangerous type of fat.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:10%
So if we want to start
improving our blood sugar,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:10%
we have to take this
seriously, and we

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:10%
have to take this
into our own hands.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:10%
And we can start with
these five things.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Number one, put on
a continuous glucose

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:84%
monitor and start learning
what works for your body.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Number two, build your plate
around protein, healthy fat,

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and fiber to mitigate some
of those blood sugar spikes.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Number three, move your
body, especially after meals,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.260 align:middle line:90%
and build muscle.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:10%
Number four, take
time for relaxation.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of stress.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
We can't get rid of it, but
we can relax our bodies.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And number five,
sync your bodies

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:84%
with nature's light
and dark cycles

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to support better sleep because
anything we do to support sleep

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:90%
will support better blood sugar.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to feel
more energy, sleep better.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And finally, throw out
that stupid granola bar

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.440 align:middle line:90%
in your purse.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
We can't wait for our
doctors to catch this.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I healed my PCOS and
my blood sugar issues.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:90%
And you can, too.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:90%
