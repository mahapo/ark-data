00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Some 20 years ago, I received
a letter from a woman named

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Lydia.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.850 align:middle line:10%
And in her letter,
Lydia was describing

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.080 align:middle line:10%
how consuming a blue green
algae for about a year,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:10%
it eliminated all
of her third degree

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:10%
burn scars that she had
had on our face, chest,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.040 align:middle line:10%
and harm for about 50 years.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.240 align:middle line:10%
So the understanding of
what this blue green algae

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.190 align:middle line:10%
was doing in the
body is really what

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:10%
led me to stem cell research.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:90%
So we'll talk about stem cells.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.660 align:middle line:84%
When most people think about
stem cells, it's a treatment.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You go somewhere to get
stem cells for a disease

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:90%
or for longevity.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And these stem cells oftentimes
come from the bone marrow,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.495 align:middle line:90%
from the blood, from fat tissue.

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they're
already in your body.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not better because we
take them out and put them back

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So to me, the question
20 years ago in my mind

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:84%
was if stem cells have such
immense regenerative properties,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:90%
what are they doing in the body?

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And is there a way of tapping
into a regenerative potential

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:90%
of our own stem cells?

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.380 align:middle line:84%
But before I answer
that question,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to
establish the crucial importance

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of stem cells in human
health by positioning them

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
at the two extremes of what
they represent for human health.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:84%
On one hand, their
absolutely incredible

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:90%
regenerative potential.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
end, the extreme

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
limitation that they
impose on human health.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's start
with the first one.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:84%
The incredible
potential of stem cells.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Here's a study done by
the group of Doris Taylor.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:90%
She took the heart of a mouse.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And then in the cardiac
tissue, the circulated

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.800 align:middle line:84%
digestive enzymes that
completely digested the heart

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:90%
muscle.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So 12 hours later,
there's nothing left.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The only thing left is the
soft skeleton of the heart.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:84%
The connective
tissue of that heart.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:10%
And on that connective tissue
that still contains the trace

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:10%
that it was the heart, they put
the stem cells from that mouse.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And within about a week,
they had a beating heart

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:90%
in a test tube.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
That is the power
of your stem cells

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
sitting in your bone
marrow right now.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
You'll never be without a
heart or a heart to rebuild.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But you may be with a damaged
heart, damaged liver, damaged

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:90%
pancreas.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So if stem cells can repair
a heart, an organ that is not

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
known to repair
easily, just imagine

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.670 align:middle line:90%
what they can do for the rest.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And at the other
end of the spectrum,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
you have the reality
that we have evolved

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
over tens of thousands
of years with a life

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:90%
expectancy of 30 years of age.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Longevity has never been
selected in our evolution.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Our power to heal was not
needed beyond 30 years of age.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So today we're born with red
marrow that makes stem cells.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And as we age, that red marrow
converts into fatty marrow

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:90%
that does not make stem cells.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
By age 30, we've lost about
90% of our red marrow.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is totally
reflected by a decline

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:84%
in 90% in the number of
stem cells in circulation.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Stem cells are
your repair system.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Any time you have a problem,
an injury, the affected area

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
will trigger the
release of compounds

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.800 align:middle line:84%
that will go to the
bone marrow that

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.350 align:middle line:84%
will trigger the release of
stem cells from the bone marrow.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
As stem cells circulate
everywhere in the body,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
the damaged area will
release other compounds

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that will attract stem
cells to that area.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Stem cells will
migrate into tissue,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:84%
multiply, and become
cells of that tissue.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:84%
It is your repair system
since the day you are born.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.838 align:middle line:84%
Remember when you are a kid, the
injuries that you may have had.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you probably
don't remember them,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
because they healed super
quick and they're gone.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
You have the same
injury today, they

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
don't repair as quickly
as they used to.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they linger
for quite some time.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It's because you don't have as
many stem cells as you used to.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.310 align:middle line:90%
They are your repair system.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
More stem cells in circulation
means more stem cells

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to participate in this
process of tissue repair.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Two people with the
same broken bone.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The one that heals the
fastest and the best

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
just happens to have more
stem cells in circulation.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So if that is true,
scientists ask the question,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
if we have a means of putting
more stem cells in circulation,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
could we change the course
of disease development?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And these studies were done.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:84%
If you increase the number
of stem cells in circulation,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:84%
many studies have shown you
can either improve or sometimes

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
even reverse heart
disease, Parkinson's,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's,
atherosclerosis, diabetes,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
problems touching so
many different aspects

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.670 align:middle line:90%
of human health.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.258 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
greatest discovery

00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:84%
in the field of stem
cell research for you,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
because it touches
every single one of you

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:84%
is that yes, stem cells are
the repair system of the body.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But they are also the
maintenance system of the body.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:84%
When you are 60
years old, you don't

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
have a 60-year-old liver,
60-year-old pancreas

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:90%
or 60-year-old heart.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything is constantly
going through a process

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:90%
of tissue turnover.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You have a new liver
every two, three years.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:90%
New skin every month.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Half of a new heart
every 25 years.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Turnover means you
lose cells every day

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and you need to
replace them in order

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.830 align:middle line:90%
to maintain organ function.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.450 align:middle line:84%
That's the role of
your stem cells.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.690 align:middle line:84%
By age 30, you've
lost 90% of them.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in your 30s, you
discover you're not superman,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:90%
you're no longer Wonder Woman.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
From that day, you don't
have enough stem cells

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:90%
to replace what is lost.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.840 align:middle line:84%
From that day on, you start
to accumulate a deficit that

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
will result years down
the road into some sort

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:90%
of age-related diseases.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So this understanding of
the stem cell development

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:90%
of disease--

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
stem cell part of
disease formation

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
is something I
published 10 years ago.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And in that paper,
I was suggesting

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
there is one way to
test if this is true.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's count the
number of stem cells

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
in people who have developed all
kinds of age-related disease.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And let's compare that to
healthy people of the same age.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.998 align:middle line:84%
And today many of these
studies have been done.

00:05:49.998 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:84%
If you count the
number of stem cells

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
in people who have
developed heart

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.370 align:middle line:84%
disease, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, lupus,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:84%
erectile dysfunction,
high blood pressure,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
and the list keeps growing,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.077 align:middle line:84%
these people all
have 50% or less

00:06:05.077 --> 00:06:06.660 align:middle line:84%
than the number of
stem cells that you

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
find in healthy people
of the same age.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So the conclusion here is
more stem cells in circulation

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
means better ability to
repair and better ability

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to keep the health that you have
today for the decades to come.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So how can you put more
stem cells in circulation?

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Fasting more than
three days we'll

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.370 align:middle line:84%
put more stem cells
in circulation,

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.740 align:middle line:84%
or intense physical activity,
like running a marathon.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
You cannot fast all the time and
you cannot run a marathon every

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So how can you put more
stem cells in circulation?

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's really my work
for the past 20 years.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So the blue green
algae that Lydia

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.600 align:middle line:84%
had taken that removed
all of her scars,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I also had other
stories from people

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.060 align:middle line:84%
who reported repair of heart
disease, cardiovascular disease,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:90%
diabetes, the brain, the lung.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So many different
aspects of human health

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:84%
we had no understanding
of how it was working.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:90%
So we basically hypothesized.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So we are in the early
days of stem cell research.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
We hypothesized,
what if that plant

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
was working as a
stem cell mobilizer,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
putting more stem
cells in circulation?

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
So we acquired the equipment
to count stem cells.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And we started to
test this plant.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And very soon we
discovered that indeed this

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:90%
is how this plant is working.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.680 align:middle line:84%
It is putting more stem cells in
circulation about an hour or two

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.890 align:middle line:90%
after consumption.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:10%
So after documenting that
this plant was having

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.550 align:middle line:10%
an effect on stem
cells, knowing that we

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:10%
have evolved in symbiosis
with the environment,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:10%
there has to be other plants
having an effect on stem cells.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.610 align:middle line:90%
So how do we find them?

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So we looked at plants that had
been associated historically

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to a broad variety
of health benefits

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.770 align:middle line:90%
and we tested all these plants.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we engage into
this whole process,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.160 align:middle line:84%
it led me to go to remote
areas of the world,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:84%
places that don't
necessarily have access

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
to the general marketplace,
if you want, of the world.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Like what are they using
on the Tibetan Plateau?

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
There, for many
kinds of problems.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So you have sea
buckthorn berry utilized

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:90%
in traditional Chinese medicine.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan medicine,
Mongolian medicine

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
used for heart disease,
cardiovascular disease, lung

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:84%
disease, diabetes, and to
help people repair from bone

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.822 align:middle line:90%
fractures and burn to the skin.

00:08:12.822 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:90%
You look at the spread.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It's telling me we probably
have an effect on stem cells.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So we tested an extract
from seabuckthorn berry

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and we documented
that it significantly

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
increased the number of stem
cells in circulation, something

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
like 40% within about two to
three hours of consumption.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Then we went to--

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I worked with scientists who
went to Papua New Guinea, South

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.539 align:middle line:90%
America, Madagascar.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:84%
And in Madagascar,
they have a product

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:90%
that is made for centuries.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:90%
It's called Vahona.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.110 align:middle line:84%
They have in Madagascar about
60 something species of aloe.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's only one that they
use to make this product Vahona,

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's aloe macroclada.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been used for all kinds of
disease and to help older folks

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
work in the field
in their '80s, '90s.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So we developed an extract from
aloe macroclada, we tested it.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And so far, it's the
plant that is giving us

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
the greatest response in terms
of an increase of stem cells--

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.700 align:middle line:84%
number of stem cells
in circulation,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:90%
up to close to 100% increase.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
That means doubling the number
of stem cells in circulation.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.990 align:middle line:84%
You take a dose of
that product and you've

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:84%
put about 10 million additional
stem cells in your blood

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:90%
circulation.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Sit down with that
number and what it

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:84%
means when you do this for
longer periods of time.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It really boosts the
body's ability to repair.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So the message here
is to understand

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that more stem
cells in circulation

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
means that your body
can repair better.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Always keep in mind.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Let that sink in.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:10%
Your own stem cells
can rebuild a heart.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
You will never be
without a heart.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But your stem cells can do
a lot of things that would

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:90%
equate to that kind of power.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So more stem cells
in circulation

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:90%
means you can repair better.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind this is
your repair system.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when
you have a cold?

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.195 align:middle line:90%
You support your immune system.

00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when you
have something in your body

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.130 align:middle line:90%
that is not working properly?

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:90%
You tap into your repair system.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just that
this is a novelty.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:84%
The last system was
documented in the early 1900s.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.755 align:middle line:84%
A century later, we discover
we have a new system that we

00:10:11.755 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:90%
did not even know we had.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
It's your repair system.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:90%
You want to repair?

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Support your repair system
by putting more stem cells

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:90%
in circulation.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.360 align:middle line:84%
If you have more stem
cells in circulation today,

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.730 align:middle line:84%
you can repair better with
the problem that you have,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
but you can keep the health that
you have today for the decades

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:90%
to come.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.420 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:90%
