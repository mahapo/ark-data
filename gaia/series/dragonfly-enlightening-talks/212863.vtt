00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Jana, we believe
the pain is in your head

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.630 align:middle line:90%
and you're seeking attention.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.350 align:middle line:90%
OK, wait a minute.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:10%
This pain that has consumed
me for the past two years

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:10%
is in my head?

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.180 align:middle line:10%
This pain that I take
11 different medications

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:10%
for every single morning, that's
the pain that's in my head?

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:84%
The pain that has
made me feel like I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
am a baton in a relay
race passed from doctor

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:90%
to specialist, that pain?

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:84%
When I walked out of my
doctor's office that day,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I sat in my vehicle in
the clinic parking lot,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:90%
and I cried.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I cried tears of sadness.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I cried tears of what I
called pissed offedness.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:10%
And I cried tears of loss
because the only thing I ever

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.910 align:middle line:10%
wanted in my 21-year-old life
was to marry my high school

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:10%
sweetheart, was to be a
mom, and was to one day

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:10%
own my own business.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, it
felt like it was all

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:90%
being taken away from me.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
For the next six
months, I didn't have

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:90%
the dark night of the soul.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I had the dark many
nights of the soul

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.030 align:middle line:84%
until one day I was
in the grocery store.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And I never ever pay attention
to the magazine rack.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But the way the sun was shining
in the grocery store that day,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:84%
it shone a spotlight on one
specific fitness magazine.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know why,
but I picked it up.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:90%
And I put it in my cart.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I got home before I
even put my groceries away,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:90%
I took that magazine out.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I sat down, and I started
flipping through it.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped on an
article where people--

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:84%
it looked like they
were doing yoga.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:90%
They were laying on mats.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.669 align:middle line:84%
But the title of the
article was pilots.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I found out later that
it was actually Pilates.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:84%
But I had no idea that that's
exactly how you pronounced it.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And there were words
that started floating off

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the screen coming towards me,
almost in a 3D like manner,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:84%
words like healing, breathing,
alignment, and one phrase

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:90%
that said movement as medicine.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And I did what any young
21-year-old did in that moment.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I got back into my vehicle,
and I went to the mall.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And I bought a new pair of
leggings, a new water bottle,

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and a new Pilates mat because
I knew the next week I would

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:90%
be going to this Pilates class.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.033 align:middle line:84%
As a fitness instructor
to pay tuition

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:84%
while I was going
through college,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I walked into that
studio surveyed the room

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.805 align:middle line:84%
and decided in
that moment that I

00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
was going to be the best
student in the room.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So I took my ego, and I
went to the front center,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
laid down my mat, and was
ready for my first class.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:10%
Less than a minute
into that class

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:10%
as I was using my
peripheral vision,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:10%
I realized that
everyone around me

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:10%
was breathing and moving
their bodies like a symphony

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:10%
orchestra.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And me on my mat was like
the flute in a grade 5 band.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I could not move like
they were moving.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I could not breathe the
way they were breathing.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
my body humbled me.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I
had disserviced her

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:84%
because what I
realized in that moment

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
was that I was
looking outside of me

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.320 align:middle line:90%
for years for the healing.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.603 align:middle line:84%
And all I needed to do was
look in to start that process.

00:03:53.603 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
happened that day.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I went back every
Tuesday and Thursday.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And 16 weeks after my
first Pilates class,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:90%
I was off all 11 medications.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:90%
I did not understand why or how.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But I knew there was something
more that I needed to learn.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I became a certified
Pilates instructor.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I then became a
master instructor

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.317 align:middle line:84%
because I knew I wanted
to share this movement

00:04:16.317 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I was at a conference
where I was listening

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.500 align:middle line:84%
to an American
urogynecologist talk

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:84%
about his latest
pelvic floor research.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And it intrigued me when he
said that 90% of pelvic floor

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:90%
dysfunction in a woman's body--

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and at that point,
the stat was 1

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:84%
in 3 women were living with
some sort of pelvic floor

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:90%
dysfunction.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, we may think
automatically of incontinence,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:84%
laughing and peeing,
coughing and peeing, running

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
to the bathroom
multiple times a day,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.793 align:middle line:84%
maybe pelvic floor pain or
pain during intercourse.

00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:10%
But the other thing
that I learned

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:10%
was that bloating, constipation,
low-grade back pain,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.210 align:middle line:10%
chronically tight hips, and
cold tingly feet were also

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:10%
pelvic floor situations.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.313 align:middle line:84%
What happened to me that
day was almost exactly what

00:05:05.313 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
happened to me when I
was in the grocery store

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:90%
so many years ago.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:90%
There was like a beam of light.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that my life
was about to change.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I became so inspired.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I went back to my
studio, started

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
learning everything I could
about pelvic floor health,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and started doing
pelvic floor workshops.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And women that would take
their Pilates classes with me

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:84%
would fill the room
every time I offered one.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But there was
something really weird

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
about the energy in that
room every single time.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had known these
women really well.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:90%
They knew me.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:90%
They liked me.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:90%
They trusted me.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:84%
But why wouldn't they
look me in the eye

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.610 align:middle line:90%
as I was instructing them?

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't they
answer my questions?

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
And why after every
single workshop

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
was there a lineup of women
in tears telling me that I

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:90%
had just spoken to their soul?

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Why were we muted about
something so basic

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:90%
as a muscle group in our body?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.240 align:middle line:90%
We talk about sore shoulders.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:90%
We talk about sore hips.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
We talk about
having good glutes.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:84%
But we don't ever talk
about the pelvic floor.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I learned.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The pudendal nerve is the main
nerve that runs from our brain

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to the pelvic floor in both a
woman's body and a man's body.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
It is a sensory
nerve, which means

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.093 align:middle line:84%
that everything from
pleasure to pain

00:06:18.093 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is experienced
through that nerve.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:90%
It's also a motor nerve.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.720 align:middle line:90%
So it sends messages.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
When I learned that the Latin
root of pudendal is ashamed,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:84%
it answered everything
I needed that day.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that my mission was
now to not just teach women

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:84%
how to have more
confidence and sensuality,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
but it was actually to
start a conversation,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to become unmuted.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I started to wonder how
can I take that awkwardness

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.072 align:middle line:84%
and educate people so
that they became inspired

00:06:52.072 --> 00:06:53.030 align:middle line:90%
about the pelvic floor?

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:90%
So I created my three B's.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It was a very simple roadmap.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I started working with
posture or body position,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
the first B. I
started teaching women

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
that when they have
80% of their weight

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
on their toes, which is
how most of us stand,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
they're using muscles in
a really overarching way.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:84%
When you bring your
weight back 60%

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
on your heels and 40% across the
widest part of your foot, then

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.650 align:middle line:90%
you have optimal posture.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Your pelvic floor is supported.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:90%
Your bones are supported.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:84%
That tech neck
starts to get healed.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
The second B I
covered was breathing,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.722 align:middle line:84%
like a newborn baby that
breathes with their diaphragm,

00:07:27.722 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:90%
their belly rises and lowers.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
At some point in our teenage
life, we stop doing that.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We become as narrow
as we can, and we

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.808 align:middle line:84%
start breathing with
these muscles in our neck.

00:07:35.808 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And because our body
is so brilliant,

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
our brain just
reassigns the work.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
When we lose the ability
to work with our diaphragm

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:84%
because it is a direct best
friend of the pelvic floor,

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
that pelvic floor
essentially goes to sleep.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
There was one that I
kind of struggled with,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and that was blood flow.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Like a plant needs
sunlight and water to grow,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
muscles need oxygen-rich and
nutrient-rich blood flow.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And so as an entrepreneur,
I saw a problem.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:90%
And I created a solution.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I created a pelvic
floor fitness tool

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:84%
for women called the
Cooch Ball, which

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:84%
is a simple three-minute
experience of sitting

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:84%
on the ball while you're
working on your other two B's,

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
the seated posture,
nice and tall,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and the diaphragmatic breathing.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And women's lives
started to change.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I had Keeley, 25-year-old
Keeley, who came to me, newly

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
married, would get so
anxious Sunday night,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Monday, Tuesday
because on Wednesday

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
was the one day a
week she would let

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:90%
her husband have sex with her.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was such
excruciating pain.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
She thought that her
marriage wouldn't survive.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Six weeks after starting to work
with me on the three B's, sex

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%
was more comfortable.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
And six months after
that, she told me

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.570 align:middle line:84%
she was expecting
their first baby.

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Or Jane, the 62-year-old
mom whose daughter

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
was 40 years old who
would not put herself

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
in a position to have
an accident while flying

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:90%
on a trip.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.760 align:middle line:90%
And she loved adventure.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Six months after
starting to work with me,

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Jane was on a plane with
her sister to New York City.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:90%
Ladies, it's time.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand that
if it's not us, then who?

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.090 align:middle line:84%
The conversation
needs to change.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.960 align:middle line:84%
We have this beautiful,
magical cauldron

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:90%
that has physicality to it.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:90%
It has emotionality to it.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:90%
It has an energetic to it.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:10%
And the conversation needs to
shift to that of ashamedness,

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:10%
to that of the divine power,
what we innately have,

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:10%
what is our birthright.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:10%
Help me start the conversation.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, if
not us, then who?

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:10%
If not now, then when?

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:10%
Join me.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.330 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]
