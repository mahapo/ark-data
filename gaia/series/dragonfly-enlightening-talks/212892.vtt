[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
talk about money.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So women control 80% to
85% of household spending.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle line:10%
Arguably 90% of what we
interact with on a daily basis

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:10%
was not designed
with women in mind.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.200 align:middle line:10%
Examples, seatbelts,
overhead compartments

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:10%
on airplanes, sneakers, until
Allison Phoenix launched Safe.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Tesla, the door
handles on a Tesla,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
if any of you get your nails
done and also have a Tesla,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:84%
you cannot open the
door on your Tesla.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:90%
You have to use your knuckle.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
That's not a problem of
me getting my nails done.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:84%
That's a problem of no
women being in the room when

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:90%
they design that door handle.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:90%
This extends into bigger things.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a venture capitalist.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:84%
When we think about venture
capital as an asset class,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
it's actually relatively small
compared to private equity,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:90%
hedge funds, public markets.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But it has outsized
influence on how we live

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and the experiences and
products we interact with.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Amazon, Netflix, Uber,
Airbnb, all companies

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:84%
we use every day
in our lives, we've

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
taken them in into
what we want to use.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not just that we
use these companies.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:84%
It's that we've
learned behaviors

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:84%
from these companies that
are also quite innate that we

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:90%
don't think about.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:84%
We will stay in somebody's
home who we do not know.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:84%
We will hitch a ride
in somebody's car

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:90%
who we do not know.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to binge watch a TV
show all in the same evening.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And if I cannot do
it, holy smokes.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And my goodness, if I can't
get my package delivered in 48

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:90%
hours, we cannot talk.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I need to go somewhere
else and deal with it.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:84%
These are things that 10
years ago, we weren't doing.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
These are all venture
backed companies,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
male founded venture-backed
companies funded

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.297 align:middle line:90%
by male VCs, which is great.

00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
They are great
companies, most of them

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:90%
profitable and doing well.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
The reason we have
to think about that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:84%
is that because the venture
capital industry has a diversity

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:84%
If we peel it back
and we look at what's

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
happening or the profile of
the typical venture capitalist,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.710 align:middle line:84%
I am not the typical
venture capitalist.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Typical venture capitalist
is 80% male, 70% White, 40%

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
graduated from
Harvard and Stanford.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Is a very specific profile.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a very narrow profile.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
They're driving 99%
of the capital that's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
coming out of venture
capital into companies

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
that are informing our behaviors
and the things that we do.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason this
is important and why

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.523 align:middle line:84%
we have to talk about
this is for two reasons.

00:02:50.523 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
One, the behaviors, of
course, that we talked about.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Two is because there are entire
categories of opportunity that

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
are not getting funded because
it's so far outside of that

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.130 align:middle line:90%
lived experience.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Women's health is a huge one.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Women's health as a category
is worth $1.1 trillion.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.562 align:middle line:84%
600 billion of
that is menopause.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
After everything
we heard yesterday

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and what we to be
true because we're

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
going to spend 40% of our lives
in this wonderful experience

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that is menopause, 600 billion
of that is menopause alone.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Fertility, mental
health, hormonal health

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.651 align:middle line:84%
is all in the other
$400 or so billion.

00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Last year, venture capital
deployed $445 billion

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:90%
into startups.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Care to guess how much
went to women's health?

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:90%
1 billion.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:90%
It's about 0.3%.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:84%
So for a $1.1
trillion opportunity,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
the category that is venture
capital put $1 billion into it.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.407 align:middle line:84%
Women's health as a
category is larger

00:03:59.407 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
than the funding
that's being deployed

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:90%
by venture capital in total.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the
pattern recognition.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Tribalism is a thing.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Humans relate to people
that are like them.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So our White man from
Stanford who's wonderful,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:84%
we may know many of
them, is investing

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:90%
in people that look like him.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:90%
This is normal.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
This is why this room
feels so safe, because we

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:90%
relate to each other.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:84%
What venture capital
needs is a tribe of women.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:84%
We need women involved
in this asset class.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:90%
We need women deploying checks.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.273 align:middle line:84%
We need women to help
solve that funding problem.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Then the question
becomes, well, can we?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Naseem, can we do that?

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.178 align:middle line:84%
Because the parallel thing
that's happening right now

00:04:40.178 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
is an enormous wealth transfer
that's landing in women's hands.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
$30 trillion of wealth is
headed towards women's hands

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:90%
in the next 10 to 15 years.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Women stand to control 2/3
of private wealth by 2030.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Nearly 50% actually,
a little bit more

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
than that of estates that
are worth 5 million or more

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
are controlled and
owned by women today.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
going to increase.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
capital in our hands.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:90%
And there's more capital coming.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:90%
But there's one more problem.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been
taught to invest.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We haven't been
conditioned to invest.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:84%
We have been taught to be safe,
to make sure we're saving money.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just me saying it.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:90%
There's always data.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm a data junkie.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:90%
This is what you'll get from me.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.540 align:middle line:84%
There's research out in the wild
that the finance and investment

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:84%
marketing that's targeted
towards women, 75% to 85% of it

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:84%
tells us that
we're spendthrifts,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're bad with money,
that we're bad at math,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that we should just save,
that Carrie Bradshaw bought

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
the shoes, so she
couldn't buy the house.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're told.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:84%
That's the story
out in the world.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Contrast that to 80% to 90%
of the finance and investment

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:84%
marketing that's
targeted towards men

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:90%
is about taking risks.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Building a portfolio.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Being bold.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Thinking about wealth.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:84%
It's literally in
the world around us.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's why women lean on
philanthropy the way that we do,

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.740 align:middle line:84%
because I can't fail
at philanthropy.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of money
sitting in women's hands

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that isn't going into places
where you can actually tangibly

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:90%
have an effect on what happens.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:90%
So we have an opportunity.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:84%
We have an opportunity
for everyone in this room

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to think about venture
capital as an asset class

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:90%
that you can be part of.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And we can affect what's
happening with women's health

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:90%
because women's health has--

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
we have a funding
problem, that one

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:90%
I've now characterized for you.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.630 align:middle line:84%
What we've heard over
the last day and a half

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
is actually a basic
science problem as well.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:84%
We heard about clinical
trials and the gap

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
on women's health
and clinical trials.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:10%
We were excluded from
clinical trials up until 1993

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.540 align:middle line:10%
for about two decades
prior to 1993.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:84%
My favorite example of the
problem that, that creates aside

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
from all the drugs and
prescriptions that we are taking

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.540 align:middle line:84%
potentially that were never
tested on female physiology

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:90%
is Ambien.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
If anyone knows--
we all know Ambien.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.200 align:middle line:10%
It hit the market
in the mid 1990s.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:10%
And when it hit the
market, a lot of women

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:10%
started taking it to
sleep better at night.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Asterisks menopause.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.010 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
the next morning

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.602 align:middle line:84%
is they were falling
asleep at the wheel.

00:07:29.602 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And this kept happening and
kept happening, kept happening.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And what we finally figured
out is that women actually

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.450 align:middle line:84%
metabolize the active
ingredient in Ambien

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
at a completely
different rate than men.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:90%
It was never tested on women.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we're getting into
accidents the next morning.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's only one
example of the many things

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:90%
that are out there.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
The other problem on
the research side,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.040 align:middle line:84%
which again we'll come
back to how we fund it,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is about clinical trials
now have women in them.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:84%
The participation
rate is about 25%.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:90%
It's still not 50/50.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And then of all the clinical
trials that were conducted,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
about 2% are in the
category of women's health.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So we have a
participation problem

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and we have a coverage problem.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
If we were all thinking about
our capital in different ways,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.230 align:middle line:84%
we could be funding startups
that are actually closing

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:90%
the gap on basic science.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And we can then facilitate
better clinical trials

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
and be part of creating
influence that we

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:90%
don't activate right now.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:90%
So here's the charge.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Here's what we need
to do as women.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop
talking about money

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.659 align:middle line:90%
and start talking about capital.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop
talking about accounts

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and we need to talk
about portfolios.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And we need to stop talking
about assets or things

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:90%
We need to talk about wealth.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we change the
language that we talk with

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and how we engage and
how we share stories,

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
we literally have influence in
our hands that we can activate.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The check that you
write to a startup today

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
could influence the
world 10 years from now.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It could create behaviors
10 years from now

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:84%
that you can be
part of creating.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:90%
So how will you move the needle?

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:90%
