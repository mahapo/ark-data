00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:13.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was a
Friday night date night.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.280 align:middle line:10%
And I was out with
my loving husband.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:10%
It was one of those
rare nights we

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:10%
had to get the kids a
babysitter and we go out

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:10%
for a romantic evening.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.240 align:middle line:84%
We have excellent
wine, fabulous food,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:90%
there's romance in the air.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And we get home, I
tuck in the kids,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.550 align:middle line:84%
he takes the babysitter
home, and you

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:90%
know what's coming next, right?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I crawl into bed, my husband
crawls in next to me, reaches

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
his arm around me, and I
roll over, pull the covers up

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.843 align:middle line:84%
under my chin and pretend
to be fast asleep.

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I lay there, I thought,
what is wrong with me?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Am I broken?

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:90%
What happened to my desire?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.133 align:middle line:84%
What happened to my
sex drive, my passion?

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:84%
What was the reason
that I didn't

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.905 align:middle line:90%
want to reach back towards him?

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I lay there, tears
welled up in my eyes

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:84%
as I was feigning sleep,
I thought to myself,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
here I am, an OB/GYN,
a hormone specialist,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:90%
and I don't know the answers.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.860 align:middle line:90%
I feel broken.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know,
maybe some of you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:84%
have felt that way
in the past too.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I thought to myself,
is it because I'm

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.840 align:middle line:90%
exhausted or too tired?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Is it because it's going
to hurt, be uncomfortable?

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Is it because I didn't want
to fake another orgasm?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.613 align:middle line:84%
OK, don't tell me you've
never faked an orgasm.

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And so as I thought, OK,
this is my specialty,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and I know other women
are suffering too.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I committed then to
find the answers.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And I spent the next
20 years of my life

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:84%
asking questions,
doing research,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
looking for these underlying
issues that dissolve intimacy,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
that create a sexless marriage
or the relationship of roommates

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:90%
instead of lovers.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And as I researched,
I found that there

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
were three common
underlying issues that

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:90%
disrupt our intimacy.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And I call them the three
D's, desire, whether it's

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.320 align:middle line:84%
a loss of primary desire,
the desire to initiate sex,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:90%
or secondary desire.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you feel, OK, once you
get started, you're good to go.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And that can happen for
a number of reasons.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:90%
But the second D is disconnect.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:90%
You feel disconnected.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you think,
I love my partner.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I just don't feel love for them.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And the third D is discomfort,
whether from pelvic pain,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:90%
dryness.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell
my clients, if it

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
hurts every time
you do something,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:90%
why would you want to, right?

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And often, that's
subconscious and it

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.163 align:middle line:84%
causes that disconnect as well,
causes the roommate scenario.

00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
When I ask patients questions,
and as I asked and I researched,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that I realized
is that I was not alone.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I was not broken.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I was not abnormal.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And as I address these
underlying issues in my life

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and the lives of patients, I
also realize that there was

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
an important hormone
connecting all these three D's.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the most
important hormone in our body.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
It is the hormone of love
and bonding, the hormone

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:90%
of happiness and connection.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
It is a natural
anti-aging hormone

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and it is very famous for
its role in parturition,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:84%
in labor and delivery
and delivering a baby,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:90%
and in breastfeeding.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:90%
And it is the hormone oxytocin.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And oxytocin is the most
powerful hormone in our body.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:90%
It is an alkalinizing hormone.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It is a high vibration,
positive energy hormone,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
and it is healing.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It helps also with bone density,
with treating aged muscles,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.535 align:middle line:84%
with vaginal moisture
and lubrication.

00:04:46.535 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural analgesic.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
It also helps with
learning and thinking.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin is powerful,
and it's deficient states

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
you feel isolated,
disconnected, alone.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.880 align:middle line:84%
It's associated with
autistic states as well.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And there are simple ways
that we can increase oxytocin.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But what's first really
important to understand

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is how does oxytocin
get low to begin with?

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's another very
powerful hormone in our body,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's our stress
hormone, cortisol.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And it is at war
with oxytocin, often

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies at
times of stress.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
So cortisol is the
stress hormone.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's financial
stress, relational stress,

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
emotional stress, physical
stress, post-traumatic stress,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
everyday stress,
cortisol goes up.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And when it does,
oxytocin goes down.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And now you're in this
state-- it makes sense too.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
When you're in this, when you're
being attacked or you're in war,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
you don't see the humanity
and love and kindness

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:90%
features of your enemy.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You're in this fight, flight,
and free or free state, a sense

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:90%
that you need to escape.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And when cortisol is up for
too long, it gets suppressed

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and now you're in this very
dangerous physiologic state.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a state of burnout,
that sense like, hey, I

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:90%
know I like my work.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I used to love going in and now
I don't even want to anymore.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Or I know I love my husband.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:90%
I just don't feel like them.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a physiology of
burnout, divorce, depression.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is a dangerous state.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is when you're in
this state of low oxytocin

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:90%
and low cortisol, it feels--

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
you stop doing the
things you enjoy doing.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you're in
a state of isolation.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So the solution to this
state, this physiologic state,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and I've been there, is to
increase the hormone oxytocin

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:90%
throughout your day.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And I call it, not with
foreplay, but that's fun too,

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:90%
but with OxyPlay.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:90%
OxyPlay.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
By microdosing, not
mushrooms, but oxytocin

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:90%
throughout your day.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And we do that
with the three P's.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Play, doing things you like.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Playing with a pet,
that unconditional

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:90%
love you get from your animal.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Playing pickleball with
friends, going for a hike,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
doing things you enjoy, being
playful, finding the humor

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
increase oxytocin.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.390 align:middle line:90%
And the second P is pleasure.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, as women, we
have erogenous zones

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.750 align:middle line:84%
all over our body, back of
our neck, top of our head,

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.130 align:middle line:90%
bottom of our feet.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Men, well, not so much.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It's important to explore
those erogenous zones

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:90%
and have fun with it.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Get curious.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And the third P is presence and
being present with gratitude

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.620 align:middle line:90%
throughout your day.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
intimacy, being present

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
during times of sex, it's
not making your to-do list,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
your shopping list,
your carpool list,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:84%
thinking of tomorrow's agenda,
and I've done all of those.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.178 align:middle line:84%
So it is being present
and in your body.

00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:90%
And you can coach your partner.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
If you're not being
present, coach

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:90%
them to give you a spanking.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
That will put you right
back in your body.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So my girlfriend doctor's
prescription to you

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
is to OxyPlay, to
incorporate oxytocin,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:84%
microdosing oxytocin into
your day through play,

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:90%
being present, and being--

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:84%
experiencing pleasure,
doing the things

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that bring you more
pleasure in your life,

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%

Give a good oxytocin hug,
a good oxytocin kiss.

Joke, laugh.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Play.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't take yourself
too seriously.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And this way, also,
as you OxyPlay

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
with presence,
playfulness, and pleasure,

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
you're also improving your
ability to be intimate

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and to connect.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the next time your loving
partner reaches out to you,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.920 align:middle line:90%
you reach back.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:90%
