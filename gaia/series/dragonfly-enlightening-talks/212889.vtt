00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:07.824 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO LOGO]

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel very much at home
here with all of these amazing

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:10%
powerful women because I
actually have 10 sisters,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:10%
I have three daughters,
and I have a female dog.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I was pregnant
with my third daughter,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I was at the height
of my career.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:10%
I worked in AI and machine
learning for programmatic media,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:10%
which basically just means that
we built cool technology which

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:10%
utilized data to optimize
media and marketing campaigns.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was feeling
really invincible.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I was married, two little girls
at home, feeling really good.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:90%
I was crushing life.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I actually
physically got crushed.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I was seven months pregnant
when I got crushed by a car.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.490 align:middle line:10%
The pain was so intense that
I kept going into labor.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:10%
And when you're pregnant,
doctors don't typically

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:10%
give you pain medication.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:10%
So I had to figure out how to
palliate that pain naturally.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:90%
And so what did I do?

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I was prescribed six
weeks of bed rest.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so to get rid of my
pain, for the first few days,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
I laid in bed.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And how do you avoid the pain
you're feeling in your body?

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:90%
By avoiding life, right?

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So I watched
probably five seasons

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
of "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills,"

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
until I realized that
that wasn't really doing

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:90%
anything for my pain.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.740 align:middle line:10%
So I spent the next 5 and
1/2 weeks driving everybody

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:10%
around me nuts.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:10%
I dove into the
research around how

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:10%
to palliate pain that's coming
from acute inflammatory reaction

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:10%
because of the accident.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And I started to text and email
my mom, my husband, my nanny,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
anyone in a five-mile
radius recipes

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and grocery shopping lists.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Bring me food that's going to
help me reduce inflammation

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and reduce my pain.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And so it took a village.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
But I got to full
term with my daughter,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and I had an over 9-pound
child, yes, coming out of me.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And when she was born, I had
this new set of information.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And I kept my diet pretty
clean and pretty healthy

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:90%
for the next several years.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:10%
And unfortunately, I had
experienced, about three years

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:10%
later, a significant loss.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And that significant loss
just propelled me right back

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
into a chronic inflammatory
condition that caused

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:90%
a tremendous amount of pain.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I had crushing chest
pain that caused me

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.180 align:middle line:90%
to be hospitalized three times.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
All of my hair fell out.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:90%
I had a fever for 10 weeks.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get out of bed.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:90%
I was chronically fatigued.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the
doctors diagnosed me

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
with a dual
autoimmune condition.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't just have one.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:90%
I had to have two.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It was called lupus, which is
rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:10%
But now I have three baby
girls and a career to maintain.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't just lay in bed.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
So I had to figure out how
to get myself better again.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And I had this baseline
of information.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So I found a functional
medicine doctor

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:84%
who could take that baseline
amount of information

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and help me take it to the next
level and really get me healthy.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.513 align:middle line:84%
So this doctor put me on
the craziest cleanse ever.

00:03:30.513 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
It was a three-month
cleanse where

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I basically lived off of
protein powders and supplements.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I was taking dozens
of supplements.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And I removed almost every
single food from my diet.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.758 align:middle line:90%
I went nuts not eating.

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to put
all the food back in.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:90%
I totally changed my lifestyle.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
six months, after I

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
had reintegrated all of the
food, it cost me a fortune.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.130 align:middle line:10%
It was so stressful.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:10%
And I had completely changed
everything in my life.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.420 align:middle line:90%
But I felt really good.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I felt better at 36 after going
through this six-month detox

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
protocol, crushing inflammation
and crushing the pain

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:90%
that I was so proud of myself.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow, I did it.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I spent six months
really working so hard.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.160 align:middle line:84%
I was patting
myself on the back.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, yeah,
Lindsay, you got this.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
And then my daughter
at age 3 and 1/2

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
started to exhibit symptoms of
chronic inflammatory condition.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And parents in the room,
if you can agree with me,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
you'll do just about
enough for your own health.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.268 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to your children,

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
you'll literally move
mountains to help them heal.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I couldn't put
her through the same arduous,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
costly, time-intensive,
stressful protocols

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that I had gone through
for my own health.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.700 align:middle line:90%
She's only 3 and 1/2.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.480 align:middle line:90%
So I had to find a better way.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.290 align:middle line:10%
And so I dove into
what I now know

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:10%
to be culinary medicine, which
is the study of how food impacts

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:10%
your health.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Food is fuel.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And I signed up for
a program that's

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:84%
actually specific for
doctors through the Harvard

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.420 align:middle line:84%
School of Public Health and the
Culinary Institute of America.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got a certificate
in culinary medicine.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I did a
wellness coaching program

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.290 align:middle line:90%
through ACE Fitness.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to take what I
had done in my career using data

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
to optimize
advertising and instead

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:84%
start to look at bioindividual
data to optimize our health,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:84%
for myself and for
my daughter and now

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:90%
for a bunch of my clients.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So looking at data, good
data in, good output out.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.190 align:middle line:84%
So you want to find the
best, most efficacious data.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:90%
So I searched high and low.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And I finally found
a test that looks

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
at 176 different
foods, additives,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and colorings that
are potentially

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
causing an inflammatory
reaction in your body.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple finger prick
test, and it doesn't just

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:90%
look at IgG sensitivities.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
It actually looks at IgA1 and 2
and the complement C3d protein

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and for indicators of leaky gut,
which is a major contributing

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:90%
factor to inflammation.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So I did this test,
and I felt like I

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.150 align:middle line:84%
was cheating because
I had just gone

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
through this six-month
program of removing

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:90%
every single food from my diet.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And all I had to do is
prick my daughter's finger

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and find out exactly
what foods were

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:84%
causing the inflammatory
reaction for her.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Even healthy foods, like
fruits and vegetables,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
were causing
inflammation for her.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:90%
So that was much easier.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized then is that
there's not just food that's

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.382 align:middle line:90%
causing inflammation.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of other
triggers of inflammation.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's injury,
illness, and toxins.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:90%
So there's toxins everywhere.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:90%
There's toxins in our food.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And some people are genetically
predisposed to higher levels

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:90%
of toxicity.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
were genetically

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
predisposed to higher
levels of toxicity

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and therefore inflammation.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So we had to remove seed oils
and sugars and other processed

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:90%
stuff from our diet.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
But at least we had
the information.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.700 align:middle line:90%
We had the data.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:10%
And so we were able to
make small changes, not

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:10%
the big changes that I made
to my life but small changes

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:10%
so that my daughter, over the
course of time, could heal.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And she got to probably the
10-yard line when she was

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.360 align:middle line:90%
around eight this past year.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, all right,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:84%
well, how do we get
her into the end zone?

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
into different modalities.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So we tried biofeedback, which
was really helpful for her.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we did Reiki
and practice breathwork

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:90%
and meditation and NLP.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.690 align:middle line:10%
And then I got introduced to
this whole world of biohacking.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And I learned all about
near and infrared light.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And I learned about PMF
and vibroacoustic pulse

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and breathwork and all these
cool supplements and quantum

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.490 align:middle line:90%
healing and all of this stuff.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:10%
And it felt like I was
literally drinking from a fire

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:10%
hose of information.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:10%
I was so overwhelmed
again with, what do I do?

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:90%
What modalities do I do?

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I
met my lovely friend

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:84%
and business partner Yeli who
is the founder of Bio Op Life.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And she really helped boil
the ocean of information

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:90%
for me, for my daughter.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And we got my daughter to
probably the 1-yard line.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, I'm the
fuel in the business

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that Yeli and I are working
in called Wellness Eternal.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:84%
And I work on the
culinary medicine

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
side, bioindividual food
for optimal healing.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeli is the energy.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:84%
And she really knows
everything there

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
is to know about biohacking,
bioenergetic technology.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.175 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter is actually
our first employee.

00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
She, through her
healing process,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
figured out that she was
identifying as the sick kid

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:90%
because it was serving her.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:84%
It was serving her to
get out of school early,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
to come hang out with mommy
all the time, to get treated

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:90%
like a princess constantly.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And so once she finally let go
of identifying as the sick kid,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
she was able to step into
her purpose and her power

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:90%
at nine years old as the healer.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And she's actually a
level one-certified Reiki

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:90%
practitioner.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really so blessed to
have her in my life and my two

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:90%
other daughters as well.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
But what I came here today to
hopefully implore you to do

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
is to not wait until
you get crushed by a car

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:84%
or not wait until you have
to take care of a loved one

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:90%
who might be sick.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:84%
You can figure out your
bioindividual needs

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and make small changes
because I believe

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that small hinges swing the
big door of positive change.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why my company is
called Small Hinges.Health.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
change everything--

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.890 align:middle line:90%
to change everything.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
You just have to take
that first small step.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:90%
