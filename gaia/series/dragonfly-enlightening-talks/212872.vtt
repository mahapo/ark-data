>>JENNIFER SCHEINMAN:
I want you all

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.560 align:middle line:10%
to imagine a world where
we actually embrace aging,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.420 align:middle line:10%
where we don't fear it.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.310 align:middle line:84%
A world where we add life to our
years as opposed to just years

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.690 align:middle line:90%
to our life.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And what if this
fountain of youth

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:84%
was with us already in the
everyday foods that we eat

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and the miraculous way
that our body can transform

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:84%
these foods into things that
we can use for better health?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm here to tell you
that the future of aging

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:90%
is here already.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Every day scientists
are learning

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
more and more about how
we age and why we age,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and the things that we
can do to optimize aging.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have been a
dietician for over 20 years.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I have seen so many
things come and go

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
nutrition and not

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:84%
much has excited me as what I'm
going to share with you today.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's a nutrient
called urolithin A.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you've never
heard of it, don't

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
be worried because about
three years ago I had never

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.320 align:middle line:90%
heard about it either.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And I hope by the end of this
talk that I have all of you

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:90%
guys as excited as I am.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.087 align:middle line:84%
But before I talk
about urolithin A,

00:01:20.087 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I just want to share a
little bit of a story

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
about how I got to be
up here on this stage

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
talking about the mitochondria,
talking about cellular energy

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:90%
and healthy aging.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So I actually always
thought of myself as one

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:84%
of these lucky people
who have longevity genes.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So my grandmother
lived-- she died just one

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:90%
week shy of her 101st birthday.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And, true story,
even in hospice,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
she was doing needlepoint
with her fingers

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and no glasses, which still
is mind blowing to me.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And my other grandparents
all lived really healthfully

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:90%
into their 90s--

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:90%
late 80s and early 90s.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, for sure, I was--

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm a dietician, I
eat well, I exercise,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I do all of the things, I too
will have a long lifespan.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
I was in my early 40s

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.449 align:middle line:84%
and I got diagnosed
with Lyme disease,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and I had terrible fatigue,
muscle pain, joint pain,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
brain fog that kept me
questioning whether I

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:90%
was going to be able to work.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And I started to get this fear,
what if I live to my 80s or 90s

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
or 100 but I feel like this?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Because that was not a
life I was particularly

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:90%
interested in living in.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.327 align:middle line:84%
And that was where I
learned and actually

00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:34.160 align:middle line:84%
experienced the difference
between something

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
called healthspan and
something called lifespan.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So lifespan, that's that
chronological like from the day

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
that we are born to the
day that we pass away,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.810 align:middle line:90%
that is our lifespan.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But our healthspan is a little
bit more nuanced than that.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
That is actually
how many years are

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
we living free of
disease, full of vibrancy,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and doing the things that we
love to do with the people

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:90%
that we love.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I am
really committed to doing

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is, how can we help to build
the years that we are living

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:90%
healthful, vibrant lives.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So I was lucky enough
to find a practitioner

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
who treated my Lyme,
and that is definitely

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:90%
a story for another day.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:84%
But she reacquainted me
with my mitochondria.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
So as a dietician,
I had obviously

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
been very well trained in
what the mitochondria do.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
They take energy-- sorry,
they take the food and the air

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
that we breathe, and
they turn it into energy.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell you every
pathway and every nutrient

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
that went into that miraculous
process, but I was never

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
really taught very much
about that actual vesica,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:84%
the mitochondria itself and what
it does and how important it is

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and how easily it
can become damaged.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Like with the everyday
things that we

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
do, the food that we eat,
all the environmental damage

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:90%
or diseases like Lyme disease.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.568 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of went
on this journey

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:84%
to learn all that I could
about the mitochondria,

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.418 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out that
they do so much more.

00:03:57.418 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:84%
You guys are all probably very
familiar with the mitochondria

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
as the powerhouse of the
cell, but it turns out

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that they do so
much more than that.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in our body
requires energy to do its job,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it is a brain cell,
a muscle cell, a skin cell.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And other than your red blood
cells, every cell in your body

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
has mitochondria
pumping out energy.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.207 align:middle line:84%
And the cells that
really require

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:84%
a lot of energy like
your brain and muscles,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.635 align:middle line:84%
they have thousands
of mitochondria

00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:90%
there, doing their job.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:90%
And because the mitochondria--

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.300 align:middle line:84%
again, if you think of them as
a factory, any other factory

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:90%
as it gets used, it breaks down.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
It starts to become
dysfunctional.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:90%
And our bodies are--

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:90%
they're amazing, right.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies know
that our mitochondria

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
are so critical to our
life and to our health

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that we have developed this
innate ability to recycle them.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So anybody here who's
very familiar with fasting

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and the word
autophagy, right, you

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:84%
know about that recycling
process already.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But what you might
not know is that there

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
is a very specific type of
autophagy called mitophagy

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
that happens on
our mitochondria.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So as we kind of experience
life and as we get older,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.010 align:middle line:84%
we know that
mitochondrial decline is

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.133 align:middle line:90%
one of the hallmarks of aging.

00:05:09.133 --> 00:05:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And that it's
actually been linked

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
to almost every
chronic condition

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
I can think of, from
muscle decline and muscle

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
wasting called sarcopenia,
neurodegenerative diseases

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
like Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's, even

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:90%
reproductive aging.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Do you women know that
the fastest aging organ

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:90%
in your body is your ovaries?

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And they are highly,
highly dependent

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:90%
on mitochondrial health.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But here's the catch,
that recycling process,

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:84%
just like all good things,
that also diminishes as we age.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I personally want to
do all the things that I can

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.480 align:middle line:90%
to help that recycling process.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's kind of change the
narrative right now on health

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and aging and introduce you
to urolithin A And what it is

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and why I am so
excited about it.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So it is a nutrient,
it is a molecule,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and it is the first
and only molecule

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
that has been proven
to trigger mitophagy.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
exercise and we know

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
that fasting and calorie
restriction will also

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
induce mitophagy, and they need
to be a part of any wellness

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and longevity plan.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But I'm hoping to convince you
that urolithin A is something

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
that should be part
of that plan as well.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk first
about what it is.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.500 align:middle line:90%
So it is a postbiotic nutrient.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:84%
That means we don't get
it directly from food,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
we require a healthy gut
microbiome to make it.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure most
of you sitting here

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
are not surprised
that most of us

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
don't have the right
microbiome to make it.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, only about 30% to
40% of people can make it.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And so as a food
first dietician,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
this is one of those
rare places that I think

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:90%
a supplement has to come in.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
the clinical studies

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
because when you're
choosing a supplement,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:84%
I think you really have to look
at the quality of research that

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
is coming out about what you're
about to put in your body.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I got so excited
about urolithin As because it's

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
really high quality
research, double

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.190 align:middle line:84%
blind, placebo
controlled trials--

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
those are the gold
standards of trial--

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
looking, proving
first that urolithin A

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
when taken as a supplement will
stimulate mitophagy in humans.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.690 align:middle line:90%
And then what does that mean?

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:84%
What does that translate
to into health?

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And the first studies
that were done really

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:90%
looked at muscle strength.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Which as a woman
who is aging who

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.972 align:middle line:84%
works with women
who are aging, I

00:07:16.972 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
know we're not
doing all the things

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:90%
to optimize our muscle health.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And so taking urolithin A can
improve significantly muscle

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.400 align:middle line:90%
strength and performance.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's in the absence of
changing diet and changing

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:90%
exercise.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy to share all of
this research with you guys

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
really fascinating.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Next we've also seen that
the topical application

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
of urolithin A will
also stimulate mitophagy

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:90%
in the skin cells.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
have skin cells that

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:84%
are acting in a
more youthful way,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
they are better at
producing collagen,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:84%
so we see less fine
lines and wrinkles.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And we also see that
the cells, because they

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
can act more youthful, are
more resilient to the damage

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:90%
from the UV light.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And we know that sunlight is
the number one thing that's

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:90%
causing our skin to age.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's not the end of
the story for urolithin A.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.470 align:middle line:84%
If we think back
to how it works,

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that stimulating
mitophagy, making our cells

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
have more mitochondria that
they can use for more energy,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:84%
any system in the body
that requires mitochondria

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.392 align:middle line:84%
is most likely going
to benefit from that.

00:08:16.392 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is where I'm really
confident that the research is

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:84%
going in the next
couple of years.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
There are tons of
preclinical trials

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and clinical trials
that are underway,

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
they're not published
yet, starting

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
to look at things like
neurodegenerative disease,

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:90%
immune aging.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, as I said, reproductive
health, joint health.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So any of your aging
cells could potentially

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.507 align:middle line:84%
benefit from
urolithin A, and I'm

00:08:38.507 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:84%
really confident we're going to
have the science to show that

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:90%
in the next couple of years.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.093 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really glad
that you guys came here

00:08:45.093 --> 00:08:47.635 align:middle line:84%
on this journey with me to learn
a little bit about urolithin

00:08:47.635 --> 00:08:50.350 align:middle line:84%
A. I encourage you to do
some more research to learn

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.160 align:middle line:90%
more about it as well.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you'll get as excited
about this nutrient as I am.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:90%
