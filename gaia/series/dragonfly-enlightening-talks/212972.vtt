00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.240 align:middle line:10%
>>KARA COLLIER: 8,000 people
were surveyed and asked

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480 align:middle line:10%
the question, do you
consider yourself healthy?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And 86% of people
said, yes, I feel

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.810 align:middle line:84%
like I'm in pretty good
physical and mental health.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Yet, at the same
time, 95% of Americans

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
have tried to lose weight
in the last five years.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.420 align:middle line:84%
60% of Americans experience
extreme fatigue and tiredness

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.100 align:middle line:84%
40% of Americans experience
disruptive digestive issues

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.780 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
A quarter of Americans
are taking medication

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.660 align:middle line:90%
for their mental health.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And over 30% of people are
taking some type of sleep aid.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
The reality is these
symptoms are not normal.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
They are signals that your
body is trying to tell you

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:90%
that something is off.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And these are all symptoms
of poor metabolic health.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Metabolic health may
sound like a fancy term.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
But really, all it
is the processes that

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:90%
turn food into usable energy.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And when these processes
are working well,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:90%
we don't have these symptoms.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:90%
We feel amazing.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And we prevent some of the
most common chronic illnesses--

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
diabetes,
cardiovascular disease,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:90%
neurological conditions.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:84%
This is why you can
consider metabolic health

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
as the foundation of
good health overall.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, we're
in a state of pretty poor

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
metabolic health overall.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Only 7% of Americans
are considered

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:84%
to be in optimal
metabolic health.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So 93% of us have some form
of metabolic dysfunction.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So on one hand, we
have the vast majority

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of people who feel like
they're in pretty good health.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
we have the vast majority

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
of people who are actually
not in great health.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So how did we get
to a place where we

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:90%
have such a stark misalignment?

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason for
this is that our bodies

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
are designed to live
in an environment

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:90%
that we no longer live in.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Our environment around us has
evolved so rapidly over the last

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
hundred years, few decades, even
last few years that our genes,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.360 align:middle line:84%
our biology, cannot keep
up with the pace of which

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:90%
our environment is changing.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So now we're stuck
in this vessel

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
that isn't at the same level
of what we need to thrive in.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Our environment around us
is completely different.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And what this causes is
essentially this dysfunction.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's see how this
really plays out.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.240 align:middle line:84%
This is maybe something
we've all eaten before--

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:90%
a Dorito.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And while we don't consider
this a health food,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:84%
we all know that
Doritos are junk food.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Do we actually understand how
engineered and biologically

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%
damaging these foods are?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the first
ingredient-- corn.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:84%
This isn't the type
of corn that you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:84%
see flowing in a field
in the wind somewhere.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
This is corn that has gone
through multiple layers

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
of processing to be the most
refined form of pure starch

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we combine it
with the second ingredient,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:90%
vegetable oils.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't fresh pressed
oil from a vegetable somewhere.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
This has also been
through multiple layers

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.090 align:middle line:84%
of processing to be an
inflammatory, pure source

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:90%
of fat.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
You combine those
two things together.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:10%
And you have a hyperpalatable
mixture that literally

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:10%
doesn't exist in nature.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we layer on MSG,
salt, artificial flavorings,

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:90%
chemicals, additives.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And we've created a
food-like substance

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:90%
that is literally addictive.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's triggering all the
same neurological pathways

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:90%
that drugs do.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And you might think
this only applies

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:90%
to clearly processed foods.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.970 align:middle line:10%
But a lot of the foods
that we're eating

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.560 align:middle line:10%
are actually a lot
more engineered

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:10%
than we realize, things like
peanut butter, oatmeal, yogurt,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:10%
bread.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are designed
to work against your health.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And it applies to
our produce too.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.490 align:middle line:84%
The apples in our
supermarkets today

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
are larger, sweeter,
lower in fiber,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and lower in nutrients
than the apples

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:90%
our ancestors used to eat.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is just
our food system.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.400 align:middle line:10%
Then we're in this
physical environment

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:10%
that is causing us to also not
work towards our health goals

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:10%
because the reality is
our bodies are designed

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:10%
to be as lazy as possible.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:10%
We don't want to expend energy.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:10%
And if there's an option
to conserve energy,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.580 align:middle line:10%
that's the route
we're going to take.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And now we live
in an environment

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.420 align:middle line:84%
where we literally don't
have to expend energy

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.800 align:middle line:90%
if we don't want to.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:90%
We can sit on our couch.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And we can order our groceries.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:90%
We can adjust the lights.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:90%
We can adjust the thermostat.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.000 align:middle line:90%
We never have to move.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.570 align:middle line:84%
We used to walk almost nine
miles a day on average.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:90%
And now we walk less than two.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:84%
When you place an escalator and
a stairs next to each other,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
98% of the people are going
to take the escalator.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
food system that's

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:90%
hijacking our reward system.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
We have this physical
environment that's

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.550 align:middle line:90%
encouraging us to be sedentary.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And then the environment
that's supposed to support us

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
through all of this,
our health care system,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
isn't really designed for
optimal health either.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it's designed to get
you in and out of the door

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:90%
as quickly as possible.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to
help you address

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:10%
those symptoms I rattled off.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely not going
to help you prevent them.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it's going to
intervene 30, 40 years later,

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
when those symptoms have
manifested into a disease state.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, we have a
lot working against us.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Our environment is pushing
us to be obese, sedentary,

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:90%
and metabolically broken.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:90%
But there's good news.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:84%
There is something
we can do about it

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of these
symptoms, these problems,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.430 align:middle line:90%
these diseases are preventable.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that the
problem isn't solvable.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It's that we haven't been
addressing it in the correct way

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
because a motivational
speech or pure willpower

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
or your accountability buddy
isn't enough to overcome

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:90%
this environment around you.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we need to lean
on technology to support us,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to help us bridge that gap
between our environment

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:90%
and our biology.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And we need technology
that augments

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
things, that works
with our biology

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.878 align:middle line:84%
and supports us
in a positive way.

00:06:27.878 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you an example
of a simple piece of technology

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:90%
that has worked in the past--

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.120 align:middle line:90%
a pedometer.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Really simple-- all it's
doing is counting your steps.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
You put up a
pedometer on somebody.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:90%
And they suddenly walk 27% more.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we advanced
that technology.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
We make it even better into
something like a Fitbit

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.200 align:middle line:90%
or an Apple Watch.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, people
double how much they walk.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So this piece of
technology works because it

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:90%
tracks something that matters.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And it works with our reward
system, not against it.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.670 align:middle line:84%
But step counting
sedentary behavior

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.808 align:middle line:90%
is just one piece of the puzzle.

00:07:01.808 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
The bigger issue at
root here is that we're

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:84%
in this state of
metabolic crisis.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, there is
a piece of technology

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
that helps to address
your metabolic health.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
It's called a CGM or a
Continuous Glucose Monitor.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And historically,
this technology

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
has been used in this
very narrow pathway

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:84%
of just medical
management of diabetes,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:90%
which is extremely useful.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:10%
But we realize when you
re-imagine how it can be applied

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:10%
and you instead use
it as a proactive

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.550 align:middle line:10%
and preventative
general wellness tool,

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.060 align:middle line:10%
you start to see
amazing outcomes.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with thousands
of patients now wearing CGMs.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And I see people improve
their energy levels,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.840 align:middle line:84%
lose weight and
actually keep it off,

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.120 align:middle line:84%
sleep without an aid
for the first time,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and reverse their diabetes.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
They're living better and
more fulfilling lives.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
It works for three
primary reasons.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:10%
First, it's tracking
a metric that matters.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:10%
Just like step counting
was an important metric,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.970 align:middle line:10%
a CGM measures your
glucose levels 24/7.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is essentially
that fuel system

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:90%
for your metabolic engine.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Second, the data is personalized
to you because it turns out

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:84%
there is no
one-size-fits-all approach.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:90%
We are all unique individuals.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we get data
from our own body,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to create
an individualized plan.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:10%
But third and most
importantly, it

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:10%
works with your reward
system, not against it,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:10%
because our brains are hardwired
for immediate gratification.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.132 align:middle line:10%
We love that instant click.

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:10%
This is why social
media is so addicting.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:90%
We want that immediate feedback.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times,
with our health habits,

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
there's a very
delayed gratification.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the reward or the
consequence for a long time.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But instead, when
you're getting feedback

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:84%
from your body in
real time 24/7 and you

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.780 align:middle line:84%
go to reach for that
additional Dorito

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and you see your
glucose rising instead,

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.540 align:middle line:84%
it suddenly becomes less
addictive and less tempting.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.517 align:middle line:84%
Or when you're
sitting on your couch

00:09:03.517 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to muster up
the motivation to go to the gym

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
or go on a walk, you're
getting that biofeedback

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:84%
from your body
that's incentivizing

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.350 align:middle line:84%
you to do the right thing
because this type of reward

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
system, this type
of feedback is what

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
creates small, consistent habits
that stick for the long term.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And what we know is those
are the type of habits

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
that stack up and lead
to meaningful outcomes.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:84%
We need to find things that
can help us be consistent.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this tool helps
to solve some of these really,

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
really important
problems because we're

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.980 align:middle line:84%
no longer blind to the
misaligned environment

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And it also puts the power back
in your hand as an individual.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to be an
active driver in your health.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Because if we aren't intentional
in making active decisions,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:84%
that environment around
us is going to push us

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.280 align:middle line:90%
towards that majority path.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It's going to push
us towards that path

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
of poor metabolic health and
poor health overall, where,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
instead, if we take advantage to
these tools at our fingertips,

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
we can be active drivers
and change the trajectory.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe it's time
to flip this statistic.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's time to
make it so 93% of people

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:90%
are in optimal metabolic health.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I believe it's time
to make sure that we

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:90%
are in control of our health.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's time to
normalize feeling amazing

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
