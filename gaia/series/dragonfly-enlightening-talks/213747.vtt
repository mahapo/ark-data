00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So what if I told you that
your brain isn't the only organ

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
in your body that receives
and processes information.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.600 align:middle line:10%
What if we had
another organ waiting

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:10%
to change our understanding
of how our brain works

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:10%
and the future development
of neurotechnologies?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:84%
An organ that not only
affects how we think and feel,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
but now is being seen
as a crucial link

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.090 align:middle line:84%
in mental health,
neurodegeneration,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:90%
and even consciousness.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
So I started my career as
a pharmaceutical scientist,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and I was actually
involved in studies looking

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:90%
at drug deposition in the lung.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was mainly
involved in studies

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:84%
looking at how we are impacted
by electrostatic fields.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it was
from that experience

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
that I came to the conclusion
that a lot of these drugs that

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
are being taken, especially
for things like asthma, which

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
was my field of study, could
be enhanced or even totally

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:84%
eliminated by very simple
techniques such as grounding,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So this led me to
leave my position

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:90%
in pharmaceutical company.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I
moved to California

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and became more
involved in research

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:84%
into alternative medicines
that embraced these effects

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:90%
of charges within our body.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
actually at structured water

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, structured
water forms, when

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
water is subjected to
an electromagnetic field

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.950 align:middle line:84%
like light, that's next to a
charged surface, for example,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:90%
a cell membrane.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.840 align:middle line:84%
But because I had a
neuroscience background,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
this very quickly led me
to think about the brain,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:84%
because after all, the
brain is 75% water.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So could light with its
amazing effect on water,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:90%
have an effect on the brain?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And this led me to the field of
transcranial photobiomodulation.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's a
bit of a mouthful,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:90%
so I'll just spell that out.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Transcranial meaning over the
head, photo meaning light,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.820 align:middle line:84%
modulation meaning
to change something.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
So really, this is
just shining light

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
onto the head to have an
effect on brain function.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I very
quickly found out,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.502 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of
people who were already

00:02:30.502 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:90%
doing this kind of research.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
looking at light.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly
enough, they were

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:84%
looking at supposedly
degenerative diseases

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's
and having a positive effect.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:10%
So this is me,
this is me in 2018.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I did
some data collection

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:84%
for a trial using
near-infrared light,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:90%
and this is a dementia trial.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And it became very apparent to
me over the course of the trial

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.540 align:middle line:84%
that this therapy
really does work.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I saw some radical
changes in the patients

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.960 align:middle line:84%
that were on the active
arm of this trial.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't so happy
with the delivery

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:90%
devices that were being used.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I wanted something that was
a bit more usable, a bit more

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:84%
applicable,
something that people

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:90%
could use at home, perhaps.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what started
me on my own five-year journey

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:84%
to find the best delivery
system for light therapies,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.740 align:middle line:84%
for brain health, for myself
and for people who are looking

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:90%
to optimize where we're at.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'll briefly go back
and talk a little bit

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
about what is light therapy,
just as a bit of a catch-up

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:84%
before I start going into how I
think really we need to change

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
the way that we're using
light therapy delivery

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and especially in regards
to the second brain.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So photobiomodulation,
really, it's

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:84%
just utilizing specific
wavelengths of light

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
in a targeted way to have
an impact on the body.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking
about particularly light

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
for the brain, we use
red light therapy.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're using light
that's in the red spectrum

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and in the invisible
light spectrum,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
or it's called
near-infrared light.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:84%
And light is mainly
received in the body.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:84%
We are covered in
light receptors.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:90%
We are diurnal mammals.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:90%
We have evolved outside.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to
respond to light.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main
mechanisms of action

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
is light is received by these
small organelles in the body

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:90%
called mitochondria.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to take note
of what the mitochondria look

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
like here.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.680 align:middle line:90%
They even look like bacteria.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's because they have
an evolutionary background

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and ancestry that bacteria--
that mitochondria probably were

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:84%
bacteria that have been taken
up by multicellular organisms.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's maybe
no surprise when

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to you a
bit now about the microbiome,

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that the mitochondria is
the place where we receive

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and utilize transformed light.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So what is the second brain
that I'm talking about?

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm talking here
about the microbiome.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So the microbiome is a 3-pound
invisible organ that's situated

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:90%
mainly in our gut.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Most of our bacteria
are in our gut.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
90% of the cells in
the body are bacterial.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:84%
That may be a slight
overestimation,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.670 align:middle line:84%
but I've looked at
a lot of papers.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a factor of
between 2 and about 10.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So we are at least
50% non-human cells.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So 50% of our body is not what
we would consider ourselves.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:84%
It's bacterial, it's yeast,
it's other kinds of microbes.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
90% of your neurotransmitters
are made in the gut.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And the microbiome
has a profound effect

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.640 align:middle line:84%
on the production of
these neurotransmitters.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome is an integral
part of the immune system.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:84%
The microbiome interacts
with our vagus nerve

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and is sending messages
constantly to the brain,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
telling us what to
do and influencing

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:90%
our mood and our behaviors.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps you're not
quite convinced yet

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
that the microbiome is
having this profound effect.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to consider the
case of a microorganism called

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:90%
toxoplasma gondii.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a microbe
that infects mice.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And this causes the mice
to lose their fear of cats.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when
mice are infected

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
by this bug, this
microbiome, they actually

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:90%
become attracted to cats.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is a way that this
particular parasite is actually

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
hijacking the mouse's free
will to its own agenda.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Again, grasshoppers.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So grasshoppers can be affected
by a parasite called hairworm.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, hairworm will
invade a grasshopper

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and cause the grasshopper to
find water and jump into it.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
grasshopper-- this

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is totally out of what a
grasshopper would usually do.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And the grasshopper
meets, unfortunately,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:84%
its watery demise, but it
completes the life cycle

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:90%
of that parasite.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So this leads us to a
very interesting question,

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.140 align:middle line:84%
how many of our own choices and
decisions are truly our own?

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And how many of those are
the agendas and motivations

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
of our microbe and
our microbiome?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is why when I was
looking to develop the most

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:90%
optimum neurotech.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
I decided that we really do need
to have a holistic approach.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, two brains
really are better than one.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
If we want to develop the
most effective neurotech,

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.030 align:middle line:84%
we have to take into account
the interconnectedness

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:90%
of our existence.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.600 align:middle line:84%
We have to embrace the fact that
we are not just individuals,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.560 align:middle line:84%
we are symbiotic communities of
organisms all working together.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And by embracing that
interconnectedness,

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
by developing technologies
that not only target the brain,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:84%
targets the site that we're
actually trying to modify,

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
but also takes into
account our microbiome.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We can then form
neurotechnologies

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
that really are
the most effective

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and give us really
the best chance

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.710 align:middle line:84%
of having healthy
brains, healthy guts,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and a healthy community
living within us.
