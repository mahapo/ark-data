00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're anything like
me, you want to age well.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.200 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
neurologically sharp.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:10%
You want to be physically fit.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.760 align:middle line:10%
And you want to defy aging.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:90%
You probably have a great diet.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:84%
You want to meditate
to manage your stress.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And you probably have a
no-fail exercise routine.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been told,
if you do these things,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:90%
that enhances longevity.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been told,
if you do these things,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.300 align:middle line:90%
you will have a sharp mind.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:84%
You will have an agile, able
body, and you will defy aging.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.240 align:middle line:84%
My clinical practice focuses
on environmental medicine

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.465 align:middle line:90%
and women's health.

00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Environmental medicine
is the interplay

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
between the environment and
how it impacts our health.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And while this does impact
everyone, for women,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:90%
there are some specific targets.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been seeing
patients for 25 years

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and I consider myself to be
growing old alongside of them,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
watching them go from
three years old to having

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
their own babies, saying
goodbye to some family

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:90%
members as they pass on.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's been fascinating to
watch how some of these people

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
get diagnoses and what the
issues they encounter are.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that some of these
issues that they experience

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
are because we have
been sold a myth.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
We have been sold
a myth that beauty

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
requires dangerous chemicals.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:90%
Is that even true anymore?

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And we assume that when
we go to the store,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
we can grab something
off the shelf

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's safe because somebody
else has checked on that for us.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.493 align:middle line:90%
Is that really happening?

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Most of the things we see
on the shelves these days,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:84%
nobody has checked
on the safety.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.080 align:middle line:84%
None of this has
been here before.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Picture your grandparents'
bathroom cabinets.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Did you see lip plumper
and gel nails there?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:84%
We haven't seen these things
before, and none of them

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
are acutely dangerous
or immediately fatal.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But generally, nature
doesn't have a role in these.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And when nature doesn't have a
role, there will be a backlash,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:90%
I promise.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing
something recently

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.670 align:middle line:90%
that changed everything for me.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't ignore it anymore.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing people
in their younger years

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
with cognitive challenges--
brain fog, memory loss,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:90%
depression, anxiety, insomnia.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:90%
The brain is inflamed.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at the general
things that caused this-- sleep,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:90%
stress, mood, food--

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:90%
it didn't make sense.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
I had a 45-year-old woman come
in, seemingly at the prime

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of her life, with
cognitive challenges.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't repeat back to
me four numerical digits.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't make
a grocery list,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and she got lost
driving in her own town.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
We had to dig deep to figure
out what was going on.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And we ultimately found that
she had some detoxification

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
challenges that prevented
her from excreting toxins.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So she had this
accumulation of toxins

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:90%
that were impacting her brain.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Our environment is
changing so rapidly,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:90%
our biology can't keep up.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Our accumulations are stacking
one on top of the other.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And there are few policies in
place to protect our health.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that your
grandmother or aunt that was 90

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
would go to a birthday party
or a Christmas celebration

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:90%
and not know which it was.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And we weren't that
concerned because she was 90.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:90%
This is a common cause of aging.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
But now I'm seeing that in
people that are 60 and 70.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.760 align:middle line:84%
How is this all going
to look in 20 years?

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Will they even be
neurologically intact?

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:90%
And what about teenagers?

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Are they even optimal
in their adolescence?

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
The thunderbolt
moment came for me

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:84%
when I realized, yes,
we can address dementia,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Parkinson's, MS, memory loss.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:84%
But shouldn't we
be looking upstream

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:90%
at what is causing this?

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:84%
As a naturopathic doctor,
I am trained to look

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
at the cause of a problem
versus treating the symptoms.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And as I really started to
contemplate what is going on

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
here, I realized that
the root cause of this

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
is happening before we
take our first breath.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.502 align:middle line:84%
So it's very
complicated, of course.

00:04:34.502 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Here's a couple of
things to think about.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
One, we were all assured
that the placenta was

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
this magical barrier
that protected the baby

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
from the outside environment.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, babies
are arriving here

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.740 align:middle line:84%
with a documented 287 chemicals
in their umbilical cord blood

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:90%
samples at the time of birth.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Is that what's causing
ADD and autism?

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has studied
the chemical cocktail

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:84%
on the developing
brain or that fetus.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And, two, there's a concept
called vertical transmission.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Picture a line going all the way
through your maternal lineage.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
What your great-grandmother
was exposed to--

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
her genetics, her epigenetics,
her total toxic load--

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:90%
she passed to your grandmother.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Your grandmother passed
it to your mother,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and your mother passed that
along with all of her exposures

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:84%
to you, and you passed
it to your children.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
So I know that is
an ugly visual.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.102 align:middle line:90%
It's a dire topic.

00:05:38.102 --> 00:05:39.060 align:middle line:90%
It's really depressing.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But now that we see
the problem, herein

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
lies the opportunity
to change it.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:84%
If prevention is
possible, what would you

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.950 align:middle line:84%
do if you could affect
your future lineage

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:90%
by avoiding toxic exposure?

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if you
could protect your egg quality

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:90%
by avoiding those toxins?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And what would you do if you
knew you could strengthen

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
your great-great-grandchildren?

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do
is avoid toxins.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty easy.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.610 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
involuntary exposures,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.897 align:middle line:84%
and they are hard to find if
you don't know where to look.

00:06:14.897 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know when I was
pre-conception, or even pregnant

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
for that matter, what was in my
control and what was at stake.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:90%
And you didn't either.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:90%
But now we know.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And so in order
to create a shift,

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:90%
we have to create a movement.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Women want to focus
on the nursery.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
They want to buy
organic crib sheets,

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:84%
they want to buy
non-toxic paint,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and they want to buy
unscented laundry detergent.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But upstream of
that, before we spend

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:84%
one night in that
crib, that baby,

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:84%
we need to focus
on what is being

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:90%
driven through that placenta.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Babies are overexposed
in the uterus.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
We need to create
a movement, and we

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:84%
need to support women so that
they think about detoxifying

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:90%
before they conceive.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:90%
That seems so obvious.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.748 align:middle line:84%
Duh, you want to detoxify
before you conceive,

00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
but how many women have sat
down in my office and said,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to get pregnant in a few
months and I want to do a detox?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
We can't do that because
we have been accumulating

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
these toxins over a
long period of time,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:90%
in fact, generationally.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's not safe
to mobilize those

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:90%
too soon before you conceive.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:90%
We need time to do this.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But wait, there is power in
the hands of the consumers.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
What you eat matters,
where you shop matters,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:90%
what you buy matters.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And women are the gatekeepers
of health for their family.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
They make the appointments
for their family,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:84%
they research
healthy alternatives,

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and they do most
of the shopping.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:90%
So marketers are watching you.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:90%
So, what is in your control?

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Couple of things--
exposure and elimination.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We are overexposed and
our elimination pathways

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:90%
are suboptimal.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But these are things
we can affect.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:10%
With exposures, if you
leave today with one thing,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:10%
I want you to pay attention
to your fragrance and plastic

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:10%
exposures.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Both of these things
impact reproductive

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:84%
health, the neurologic
terrain of that unborn baby,

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and pregnancy outcome.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
This is well-established
in the medical literature.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And elimination.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Most of us think about
just the liver when

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:90%
we think about detoxification.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But we also have skin, liver,
lymph, bowel, and kidney

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:90%
that are working on our behalf.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
support your liver,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
have a couple extra servings
of dark green leafy vegetables

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.720 align:middle line:84%
and throw some turmeric
in your smoothie.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you have a
bowel movement every day.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:90%
More is better.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Drink 2 to 3 liters of water
to support your kidneys

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:84%
because they are working on
your behalf 24/7 to eliminate

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:90%
the exposures you have seen.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.130 align:middle line:84%
The skin is the highway
of elimination of toxins

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:90%
through sweat, so get a sweat.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And the lymph is
this magical organ

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
that mobilizes toxins through
your lymphatic channels

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
when your muscles
compress around them.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So even walking
supports detoxification.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're designed to detox,
which is a great thing.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So, how would this
look different

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.258 align:middle line:84%
if you knew at the time
that you were pregnant,

00:09:28.258 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that everything you touched
and everything you consumed

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:90%
could impact your future baby?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And what would be
different if we

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:84%
knew that while we were
gestating our daughters,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.990 align:middle line:84%
we were impacting
our granddaughters?

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And imagine detoxifying for
a year before you conceive.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Would the neurologic
terrain of that baby

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
be so different that they would
look different as a teenager

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:90%
or as an adult?

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
There is power in this
to shift your lineage,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.160 align:middle line:84%
to create strength and vitality
for your family to come.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's worth talking about.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:90%
