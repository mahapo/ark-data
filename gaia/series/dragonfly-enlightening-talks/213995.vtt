00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.620 align:middle line:10%
>> When I started my
career as a scientist,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.310 align:middle line:10%
I thought the best contribution
that I could make was to find

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.360 align:middle line:10%
a cure for one of the many
chronic diseases that we develop

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:10%
as we grow older.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I
realized that the best

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:84%
way to help people live
better was actually

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
to prevent the diseases
in the first place, which

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:84%
means targeting their
underlying cause--

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:90%
aging.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.620 align:middle line:10%
So I embarked on this
journey to study aging

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:10%
and, more specifically,
skin aging, as I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:10%
saw that skin was being
overlooked when it comes

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.360 align:middle line:10%
to longevity.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of scientists,
they are focused

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
on targeting skin to prevent
heart disease or brain diseases.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.895 align:middle line:84%
But no one was looking at
our largest organ, our skin.

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Our skin is a very important--
it influences our lives

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:90%
in many ways.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
It impacts our appearance, our
confidence, our self-esteem,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:90%
and our social interactions.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Yet our skin is more
than just a canvas.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And as our skin ages,
our skin barrier weakens,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and this elevates our levels
of inflammation in our skin

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and consequently
in our whole body,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
contributing to this
process called inflammation,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.030 align:middle line:84%
which is associated with the
onset of chronic diseases.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So by treating our skin and
maintaining our skin healthy,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:84%
we are not only
improving our appearance,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
we are investing in
our overall health.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the market
is inundated with products

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:90%
that claim to defy aging.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And most of us will find out
by trying product after product

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that many of them don't meet
our expectations in terms

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:90%
of benefits or results.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:10%
The reason is that the
majority of products out there

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:10%
are designed to promote
surface-level benefits only.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:10%
They are not addressing
the root cause of aging.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.090 align:middle line:10%
Let's take retinol, for example.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:10%
Retinol works by causing
a damage to our skin.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:84%
It strips the outer
layers of our skin.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:10%
So our skin looks
smoother, but it's not

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:10%
addressing what's causing aging
in the inner layers of the skin.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, retinol can
cause inflammation, redness,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and even compromise
our skin barrier.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.340 align:middle line:84%
What if there is a
way to rejuvenate

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
our skin without causing
such side effects?

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
The answer lies in
longevity science.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Many scientists
around the world have

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
been studying this process
that is the accumulation of all

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
the cells in our tissues,
which has been associated

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
with several
age-related conditions,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:90%
including skin aging.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:84%
What are these old
cells or zombie cells?

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Zombie cells are cells that
have stopped functioning well.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:10%
They stop dividing,
and they start

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:10%
secreting inflammatory
signals that

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:10%
induce the cells around
to age faster, just

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:10%
like a rotten apple in a bunch.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:10%
So the more zombie cells that
we have in our skin, the more

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:10%
inflammation they produce, which
leads to collagen breakdown

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:10%
and leads to the signs of aging
that we are all familiar with--

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:10%
sagging, wrinkles,
dark spots, and so on.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:10%
So the hypothesis
here is that if we

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:10%
can reduce the amount of
those old cells in the skin,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:10%
we can allow the healthy
skin cells to replicate.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And we can promote this to
rejuvenate from the inside

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
out in a very targeted
and effective way.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's when our team
of scientists came in

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
and we spent years testing new
molecules that could target

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:90%
specifically senescent cells.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And we are more
interested in peptides,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
which is a common ingredient
in cosmetic products.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And after five years of research
and testing nearly a thousand

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:90%
peptides, we found OS-01.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
OS-01 is a novel
molecule that can

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:84%
reduce the accumulation of old
cells in our skin by up to 40%.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we treated skins
in the lab with OS-01,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:84%
we could see that by reducing
the amount of old cells,

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:84%
we could reduce inflammation and
we could allow the healthy skin

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
cells to proliferate, leading
to more collagen production

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.360 align:middle line:90%
to a stronger skin barrier.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, you have a
biologically younger skin

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that's healthier and
that looks younger, too.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So the consequence of targeting
the root cause of aging

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
is that you are going to
get a better appearance.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:84%
But we want to go
further and we want

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
to measure how much you can
reverse the age of the skin.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that,
we used an algorithm

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
that measured changes in the
skin's epigenetic profile,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
more specifically,
the DNA of the skin.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And this algorithm allows us to
quantify how many years we can

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:90%
reverse the age of the skin.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we treated these
skins in the lab with OS-01,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.040 align:middle line:84%
we could see that we
could reverse the age

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:90%
of the skin in 2.5 years.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But now you are wondering how
this translates into benefits

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:90%
to the skin of real humans.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's when we developed
the first skin longevity

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:84%
treatment, a topical solution
that contains these peptides.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:90%
And we ran clinical studies.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And after 12 weeks,
we could see 100%

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
of users showing improvements
in their overall appearance

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and texture, 87% improving
skin wrinkles and fine lines.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And we could measure the
improvement in the skin barrier

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
as well, showing that we
are improving the function

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:90%
of the skin and the appearance.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
But we want to go beyond and
we want to measure this age

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%
reversal in humans.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:90%
So we ran a study for 12 months.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And then after 12 months,
they collected skin biopsies

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:90%
from these participants.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And we analyzed the DNA
or the epigenetic profile

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.730 align:middle line:90%
again, with that algorithm.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:90%
And we could measure that.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.970 align:middle line:84%
We could reverse the age
of the skin in 3.3 years,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning that we are not
only not aging one year,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
we are reversing back the
age of the skin in 3.3 years.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
first time that we

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
can show that it's possible
to reverse the age of the skin

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.450 align:middle line:84%
in humans, which
is pretty exciting.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:90%
But we didn't stop there.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
We want to treat
your skin as a whole.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
We know that this is important
for overall longevity.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us forget to take
care of the skin in our body.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.900 align:middle line:84%
We pay too much
attention on our face,

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
but we don't give the
same care to our body

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
until we start seeing
signs of crepeness,

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
until our skin starts to get
thin and fragile and flaky.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we see that impacts
our quality of life, too.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So this is an exciting
time to be alive.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:84%
You guys are seeing
so many technologies

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and how science is showing
us that aging is not

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:90%
an immutable process.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:90%
It's malleable, it's reversible.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.350 align:middle line:10%
And more and more, we'll be
able to control how we age.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So here, we have
shown that we can

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:90%
reverse the age of your skin.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:10%
And other studies are
showing that it's also

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:10%
possible to reverse
the age of your brain

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:10%
and your heart and beyond.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's take advantage
of all of those resources,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and let's continue to invest
in our body, in our skin,

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and continue to enjoy
healthy years of life.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.720 align:middle line:90%
