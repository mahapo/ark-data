00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.505 align:middle line:84%
>> So sleep is a skill,
and it starts with light.

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
My main message for you today
is that your light bulbs

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.620 align:middle line:84%
are harming you, and they
are killing your sleep.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:10%
Let me explain.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:40.480 align:middle line:10%
Just this year, 248 circadian
scientists referencing 2,697

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:10%
peer-reviewed publications are
now calling for warning labels

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:10%
on light bulbs
when used at night.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Why, right?

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:90%
We all got light bulbs.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:90%
We're all using them at night.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Look what's going on here.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.140 align:middle line:90%
So why?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, they found
that the correlation

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
between the use of
light bulbs at night

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
is resulting in things like
obesity, diabetes, heart

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
disease, reproductive disorders,
psychiatric disorders, cancers,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:84%
for me, this is part of
my passion, poor sleep.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.835 align:middle line:84%
That same scientific
consensus also

00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:84%
found that the average person is
spending over 90% of their days

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Why does that matter?

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we're inside
underneath these faux lights,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:90%
what is happening?

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Our days on average are
now 100 times too dim

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.330 align:middle line:84%
as it would have been in
relation to being outdoors

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and on average 100 times too
bright in the evening than it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:84%
would have been even on the
brightest moonlit evening.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
What this is doing is causing a
major circadian dysregulation.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, I will tell you.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.725 align:middle line:84%
Circadian dysregulation is the
relationship to the 24-hour

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
rotation of the Earth and how
we used to be aligned with that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:90%
rotation when we were outside.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've gone
indoors, what has happened

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:84%
is that we have dysregulated
that natural rhythm and clock

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.350 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And what this does,
as you can see,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
is this laundry list of
impacts on our biology.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But as it relates to
circadian dysregulation,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I certainly know a
thing or two about that,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.315 align:middle line:84%
because my own story with sleep
was my own story of circadian

00:02:48.315 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:90%
dysregulation.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And what that looked
like is the fact

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
that I now think of my life
in a three-part series.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I think of it as before my sleep
breakdown, during and after.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So before, what
things looked like was

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I would have a lot of labels
and narratives around my sleep.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I would say things
like, I'm a night owl.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm a short sleeper.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:90%
It's in my genes.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:90%
I'll sleep when I'm dead.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:84%
If any of you can
relate to that.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And I would also be justified
and righteous the whole time

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
because I would say, well, I get
my best work done 2:00, 3:00,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:90%
sometimes 4:00 in the morning.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And what I would then
experience was a shift.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I would sleep in the next
day and do it all over again.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think this
was much of a problem.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I didn't notice the
impacts on my health

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:90%
and being correlated with this.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So what that looked
like was an ulcer.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It looked like
shingles in my 20s.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
It looked like increasing
anxiety, and no clue

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
as to where this
was coming from.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.120 align:middle line:84%
It was not until I went
through a period of insomnia

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:84%
while traveling internationally
under lots of confused circadian

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:84%
rhythms with lots of
jet lag and stress.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And what I experienced was
a stretch of insomnia that

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:90%
completely changed my life.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
During this time, it was one
of my rock bottoms in my life,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and the result was a time
where I really questioned,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:90%
can I go on?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Can I go on another
day in this state,

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like
I was losing my mind.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
At its worst point,
I went to the doctors

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and I left with sleeping pills.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
I realized, OK,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.690 align:middle line:84%
if I am going to
change this, I've

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
got to get to the source of what
does it take to get great sleep,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.560 align:middle line:84%
because it looks like I
got to do this myself.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So I embarked on
this quest to start

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
to learn all that I
could around what does it

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:90%
take to get great sleep.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And what I came
across again and again

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:84%
was circadian rhythm and
minding your circadian rhythm.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So understanding that, I
started to implement this.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything I told
you about, about how

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I was managing my life, I
turned that upside down.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And the result was a
totally different--

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
not only experience of life,
totally different relationship

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%
to my sleep, but suddenly
a realization that I--

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:84%
despite all of those
labels and narratives,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I could get great sleep,
and that it is a skill.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So I started a company to
help support other people

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:90%
with their sleep.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of the groups that I
work with quite frequently,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:84%
and I want to share with you,
is high-stakes poker players.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Why is that relevant?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's think about
the type of environment

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
that these people find
themselves in, right?

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Casinos that are
designed on purpose

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:90%
to confuse the circadian rhythm.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.660 align:middle line:84%
This is an environment filled
with bright lights, no clocks,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:84%
no windows, lots of stimuli,
lots of dopamine hits,

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
slot machines, all
the fun things.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, we might think
that we are totally

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:90%
foreign to that lifestyle.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
argue that many of us

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
are much closer to this
lifestyle than our ancestors.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what life for
thousands of years looked like.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.330 align:middle line:84%
You would rise in the morning
with this pinky hue sunrise

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and overhead down a
few hours into the day.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
You would have your brightest
lights right above you

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
at solar noon,
and then you would

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.460 align:middle line:84%
have a countdown between when
you're going to get to sunset.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:10%
And you had to do all the
rest of the things you

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:10%
got to do for the day
before the day is done.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's total
darkness, and we do not

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
have any other source of
light besides the moon

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:90%
until the next morning.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it was
for us, for so long.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And the wavelengths of light
that we were under for all

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:90%
that time looked like this.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful rainbow.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:90%
You'll notice it in the day.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Lots of blue light
present, excitatory,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
wake us up, wake
promoting in the evening,

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
shifting over to much
more red-centric light.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:84%
That all changed
144 years ago when

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Edison created the light bulb.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:84%
He created the incandescent
light bulb specifically,

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and it seemed to mirror
more closely to sunset.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, they
nicely parallel each other.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, this year
in the United States,

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:90%
it became illegal to purchase.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So most of us are now spending
our evenings and days,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.710 align:middle line:84%
but certainly our evenings
under these sorts of lights.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice the large
bands of blue light.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Why does that matter?

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Because blue light,
as you may have heard,

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
of course, is impacting
our melatonin production.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think many of
us might not realize

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
to what degree until we see
that laundry list that we saw

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that's impacting our
biology and to why

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
all these circadian
scientists want warning labels

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:90%
on our light bulbs at night.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:90%
So what's the solution?

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what we want to do is
mimic how life was in the past.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the first biohacks,
if you will, was fire.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Fire allowed us to
augment our days

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and allowed that augmentation
to have orange and red lights,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:84%
but not impact our melatonin the
same way our modern lights do.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
So if you want,
you could actually

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
have fire present
in your environment.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:90%
You could have candles.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you want some tech,
you could have red lights.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.490 align:middle line:84%
You could have
Himalayan salt lamps.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.820 align:middle line:84%
You could have programs that
can turn your screens red.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You can use blue blockers for
the unavoidable blue lights,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:90%
orange, or red lenses.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I want to
leave you with a challenge.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think of your
environment in your home

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and think of all the light
bulbs you have in there.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to
choose just one,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to replace
that one light bulb--

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I'd suggest in the bedroom.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:84%
But I would replace that light
bulb with orange or red bulbs.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:84%
That is going to support
not only your sleep,

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:84%
but your overall
health and well-being.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to remember one
thing, that sleep is a skill,

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:90%
and it starts with light.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
