00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> The Fertile Crescent.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:84%
This region was
once the heart of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:84%
the powerful and
sophisticated Sumerian empire.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
The legends from
Babylon and Mesopotamia

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
have a strong
presence in mythology.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
In the northern part of
this powerful crescent

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.810 align:middle line:84%
sits the mysterious
pre-diluvian site

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
known as Gobekli Tepe,
which means "potbelly hill."

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
The most recent
radiocarbon sequencing

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.860 align:middle line:84%
provides evidence that this
sacred site was carefully

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
buried and preserved
roughly 11,600 years ago.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
In the central region,
now modern-day Iraq,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:84%
there are many
significant sites,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
such as the Great Ziggurat
of Ur and the city of Eridu,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
containing evidence of
ancient urban settlements.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Since excavations
began in the early

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.500 align:middle line:84%
to mid-1800s, over
30,000 cuneiform tablets

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
have been recovered from
temples and libraries

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.620 align:middle line:90%
in Nineveh, Sippar, and Babylon.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
These tablets continue to
challenge the mainstream

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
narrative on the
origin of civilization.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Traditional history suggests
that what we call today

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:10%
the Fertile Crescent is
the cradle of civilization.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:84%
It is in the Fertile
Crescent where

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
we find the records of the
ancient history that goes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:90%
back even before the Ice Age.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the ancient
Sumerian kings' list,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:84%
it is a mysterious,
mysterious list that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
begins with eight rulers
covering a period of time

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.200 align:middle line:84%
over 300,000 years, and each
ruler ruling for periods

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:84%
of time that seem
improbable, from 18,000 to as

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:90%
much as 36,000 years apiece.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, in our way of timekeeping,
it makes very little sense.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So historians traditionally
have called this a myth,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.280 align:middle line:90%
and they've written this off.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
all of these kings

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
lead up to a time
of the Great Flood--

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
the ending of the last
Ice Age, the deluge--

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and all of the kings and all of
the times of history following

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the flood are
precisely accurate.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, why are
these times so improbable?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the lengths of time

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and the dates of the rulers
for those first eight kings

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
are actually measuring time
from a perspective that

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
is not relative to planet
Earth and our 360-day year?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that the
years that are measured

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what are
called stars, could it

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:84%
be that those stars are a unit
of measure from another world,

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.530 align:middle line:84%
as the texts suggest, when the
gods came to Earth, suggesting

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
that they came from
somewhere other than Earth

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:90%
and began that rule?

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So this begins to open
the door to the question,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
are we talking about a
pre-Ice Age civilization?

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And if all of the dates from
the flood to the present

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.980 align:middle line:84%
are accurate, then the dates
from the flood previous,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.260 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of
those four kings,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
would place this Fertile
Crescent time precisely

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.210 align:middle line:84%
into the Pleistocene,
precisely into the Ice Age,

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and even covering the
time of the Younger Dryas.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The Sumerian Kings List is
an amazing stone tablet that is

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:10%
at the Ashmolean Museum
in Oxford, England.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:10%
Now, this tablet gives us
the rule of eight kings--

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:10%
antediluvian kings-- that
rule for over 200,000 years.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.120 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
One king ruled for 36,000
years; another king

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:90%
ruled for 28,000 years--

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
giving up these immense
life spans of these kings.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is as
you get closer to the newer

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:84%
part of the text on the
Sumerian Kings List,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:84%
you start finding more
normalized life spans.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.400 align:middle line:84%
They start dropping to 900
years, 800 years, 500 years,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:90%
30 years, 40 years.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.655 align:middle line:84%
So you see this track of people
living extremely long life

00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:40.020 align:middle line:90%
spans before the flood.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Then after the flood, you see
life spans were shortened.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Sumerian Kings
List, we are told that before

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:84%
the time of the flood, there
were five sacred cities that

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:84%
were established,
including Eridu.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:10%
Kingship was first lowered
from heaven to earth

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:10%
before the time of the flood.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Then the flood came and
swept over the earth,

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and kingship was
then re-established.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding now
with these new discoveries

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:84%
is that we have further
evidence of an earlier

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:90%
habitation at these places.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
going to be finding

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
is that this is ultimately
affirming that these flood

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:90%
stories are true.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And so this opens up a
wide degree of latitude

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:84%
for alternative
historians to say,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
hey, we've been
saying for a long time

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
that our timeline of the
flood goes back to 12,000 B.C.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and that humans were in
fact inhabiting these areas.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And now we're discovering the
connective tissue and evidence

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:90%
that supports those contentions.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:10%
>> How old is the human species
in the Fertile Crescent?

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.340 align:middle line:84%
The scholar Berossus said
that the Babylonian King

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:90%
List go back 432,000 years.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.820 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, then this
area where you had Sumer,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Babylon was inhabited by
civilized human beings hundreds

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of years ago.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Fertile Crescent was the
name given to this region based

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:10%
on the two rivers known as
the Tigris and Euphrates that

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.970 align:middle line:10%
flowed down from the North into
the Persian Gulf and created

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.430 align:middle line:10%
a very fertile environment
for civilizations,

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:10%
such as the Sumerian and
then Akkadian, Babylonian,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:10%
and eventually Assyrian.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:10%
According to the Uric
list of kings and sages,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:10%
Eridu was the first city created
on the banks of the Euphrates

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:10%
River.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:10%
The tablet describes how this
majestic city used its power

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:10%
and influence to create the
Sumerian civilization that

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:10%
would encompass almost
the entire Fertile

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:10%
Crescent, stretching
from Northern Iraq all

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:10%
the way to the Persian Gulf.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:10%
And it would give rise to the
pre-diluvian cities Bad-tibira,

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:10%
Larak, Sippar, and Shuruppak.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:10%
>> In the main temple
complex of Eridu,

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:10%
known as the Ziggurat of Eridu,
we see that the top of that

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:10%
temple complex that's been
eroded for thousands of years

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.660 align:middle line:10%
contains thousands of seashells
covering the top of that

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:10%
temple, proving that that had
to have been deposited during

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.060 align:middle line:10%
the great floods of
the Younger Dryas.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> If the record
of the Kings List,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
from the time of the
Great Flood forward,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:84%
is precisely accurate it can
be verified through history

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and geology, then it's possible
that these kings actually began

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:84%
the ruling when
they came to Earth,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.940 align:middle line:84%
that they began ruling
during the Pleistocene,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
during the Ice Age, during the
warming times and the cooling

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:84%
times that go all the way up
to and include even the Younger

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Dryas, and that the Dryas would
be the reason that the flood

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.700 align:middle line:84%
happened at the time
that it happened.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It may be that through
the Sumerian King List,

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.700 align:middle line:84%
we have the most accurate
and the most precise

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
dating mechanism known to
exist, giving us insight

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
into ancient history, ancient
civilization, and the origins

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:84%
of the human species
that extend back farther

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.035 align:middle line:84%
and clearer than anything else
that we've seen to this point.

00:08:19.035 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Mainstream science describes
this influential Sumerian

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
civilization as arising around
7,000 or 8,000 years ago.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
The theory is that
this society arose

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:84%
from primitive
hunter/gatherer beginnings

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:90%
into an agricultural society.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
But when we turn our attention
to the ancient tablets as well

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.280 align:middle line:84%
as the new sites being
uncovered in Iraq,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
they tell an incredible
story about gods that arrived

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:90%
on Earth to start humanity.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Historians and researchers
that have closely

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
studied this ancient culture
believe that a race of beings

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:84%
called the Anunnaki, or
Anunna in these texts,

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:84%
may have arrived on Earth
many thousands of years ago.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:10%
>> So who exactly
are the Anunnaki?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:10%
Well, the name
itself is Babylonian,

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:10%
and it means "the people or
gods of the sky and the earth."

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But this was not
the original term

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
that was used by the
much earlier Sumerians.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
They called the same
mythical beings the Anunna,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and this means "the
people of the sky."

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And some people might
want to interpret this

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
as meaning "aliens" or "people
that come down from the sky."

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Was the Fertile Crescent one
of the areas in which humans

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.340 align:middle line:84%
were manifested
in the beginning?

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
It certainly would appear so
according to the Sumerian texts

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
which say that after
a great devastation,

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.910 align:middle line:84%
the gods came and
manifested humans again.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme that
we see repeated many times

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:84%
in many cultures
all over the world.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, it's
there in the Middle East

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
creation of humans,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:39.930 align:middle line:84%
there was a massive flood, and
the earth was re-populated.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Countless myths and legends
tell of a time where the gods

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:90%
ruled the earth.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:84%
But the stories become
muddy when researchers

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
try to understand the
genetic leap from Homo sapien

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:90%
to Homo sapien sapien.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:10%
>> From the research that I have
been looking at in Mesopotamia,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:10%
Sumeria, and also comparative
cultures in Egypt and South

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.905 align:middle line:10%
America, they talk about
a time of experimentation.

00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
be the suggestion

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that they were experimenting
with DNA to see if there

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.620 align:middle line:84%
was some way where
they could compromise

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:90%
their DNA with humans.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:10%
And at some point,
they succeeded

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:10%
because over in Egypt, which is
not too far from Mesopotamia,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:10%
they talk about
a time when there

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:10%
was a bloodline of half
human, half divine people.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So, obviously, they succeeded
because these people

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:90%
were on the throne of Egypt.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And we know they succeeded
because they also

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:84%
talk about a time
in 3100 B.C., and I

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
quote, "when the first pharaoh
of a purely human bloodline

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.810 align:middle line:90%
takes the throne of Egypt."

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're not going to
mention that unless before that,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
the time preceding
this period, there

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:84%
was a period of half human,
half divine people, which

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
is the gap in between the time
when the creator gods were also

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:84%
in charge of the different
thrones around the world.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So they must have found a
way to genetically compromise

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
their DNA with humans,
which then, of course,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
gives birth to people
who are very tall.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, they become normal people
that we see around today.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.890 align:middle line:10%
>> For the humans, any species
that came from the skies were

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:10%
called, in Middle
East, Anunnaki.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:84%
They were the people that
came from the stars to Earth--

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:90%
from the heavens to earth.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:90%
That's what means "Anunna Ki."

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who came from
the stars, from the skies,

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:90%
would be that.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
But mainly those who
settled in Middle East--

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
in the territory of Iran,
Iraq, those territories--

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.490 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that got in
touch the most with humans

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and modified them as
we know humanity today.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:10%
So they kind of were the
fathers and the mothers

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:10%
of our civilizations or our
species as we know it today.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>> As archaeologists continue to
discover throughout the Fertile

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Crescent, the sophistication
of these pre-diluvian cultures

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.180 align:middle line:84%
appears to have been happening
at a very accelerated rate.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:10%
The evidence uncovers the
path-- from primitive living

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.360 align:middle line:10%
to high society had
massive influence

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:10%
from a highly advanced culture

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:10%
>> It's so important to
understand how the ancient land

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:10%
of Sumer was built under the
rule and guide of the Anunnaki.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.580 align:middle line:10%
Because when you look
at the ancient tablets,

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:10%
you discover that all of
a sudden, out of nowhere,

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.440 align:middle line:10%
this modern civilization
just appeared.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.820 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about paved roads,
sewer systems, water treatment

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:90%
plants.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
They even had bicameral
congress, schools.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.068 align:middle line:84%
All this comes from
these ancient people.

00:13:46.068 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about
the Sumerian Kings List,

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer to the
newer age of the tablet

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:84%
where the newer
writing is located,

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.640 align:middle line:84%
you begin to see
where mankind is now

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:90%
being given some kingship.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, where it
starts with Gilgamesh actually,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you
see a half human

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
then half Anunnaki being
who's now been given kingship.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And then after him, precedingly,
more and more offspring

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
who are just human
with a smaller

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:84%
percentage of this
Anunnaki bloodline

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:90%
are now also given kingship.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.560 align:middle line:10%
So we start to see this
line where it breaks off

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:10%
from these beings-- these
advanced gods, or these Neteru,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:10%
as they call them
in ancient times--

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:10%
and begins to be mankind
actually ruling themselves

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.825 align:middle line:10%
with a king as a liaison to
these advanced alien beings.

00:14:29.825 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> If these Anunna or Anunnaki
were guiding the expansion

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Homo sapien sapien from
the Fertile Crescent region,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:90%
how did they guide us?

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Was it with brute force,
as some scholars claim?

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Or was this guidance passed
down to only a select

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
few in sacred ceremony as
it is commonly depicted

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Sumerian art?

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 1800s, an
ancient mural was found

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.620 align:middle line:84%
in the Ashurbanipal Library
of Iraq which depicts what is

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
known as the tree of
life in the center,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:84%
with a king and a
priest on either side,

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and on either side of them show
what are known as the Anunnaki

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
or Anunna represented
with wings.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And they depict something very
specific in there-- the passing

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, the seeds of
knowledge through a pine cone,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and the carrying of that
knowledge through a handbag.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
What's so fascinating
about that is not only

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
do we find the symbols of
the handbag and the pine cone

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
all throughout the
Fertile Crescent region

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
but we also find it all the way
across the world with the Olmec

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:90%
from La Venta, Mexico.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
What that shows is at
the same influences

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:44.930 align:middle line:84%
all derived from the Fertile
Crescent region of Sumer.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Assyrian tree of
life is important to me in many

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it
is a tree of life,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:84%
so it is a subject
mentioned in Genesis.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, we
immediately think

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that there is a particular
link between them.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know the Hebrews
spent a lot of time in Babylon,

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
so maybe this concept was
acquired at that time.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Then, many times the
tree is surrounded

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:90%
by angels with bird heads.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
For me, they are Nephelim.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And then they hold
a pine cone, which

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
can be reminiscent
of the pineal gland.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the symbol of the pine
cone can be found everywhere--

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
on the temples in
India; it can also

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
be found on the
Pope's cross; and it

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.120 align:middle line:84%
can be found in the
Egyptian writings--

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
in the funerary writings of the
pyramids, texts of the pyramids

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
where it talks about
the Eye of Horus.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In Assyrian iconography,
often what you see is this

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
winged genie holding these
conical-shaped objects which

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
are interpreted as
cones, like pine cones.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And they are holding in
their other hand what

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.500 align:middle line:90%
appears to be like a bucket.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:84%
And it's believed
that these pine cones

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
would be dipped into the bucket
which would contain a liquid--

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
either water or
essential oil maybe--

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:17.609 align:middle line:84%
that was then sprinkled on the
tree to somehow bring it alive.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Many scholars speculate
that this pine cone possibly

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.670 align:middle line:84%
represents the pineal
gland, or third eye,

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:84%
in the center of
the human brain.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But what did this mysterious bag
depicted in the ancient relics

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:90%
contain?

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Most carvings depict
this bag or bucket

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:90%
being clutched with one hand.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But this similar shape is
also carved on Pillar 43

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.280 align:middle line:90%
at Gobekli Tepe.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Several scholars
argue that there

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
isn't a connection between
the clutched buckets

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and similar shapes on Pillar 43.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:10%
But can the apparent
connection between the Anunnaki

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:10%
and the origins of
this pre-diluvian site

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:10%
be found in Sumerian mythology?

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:10%
>> It was Professor
Klaus Schmidt,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:10%
the discoverer of Gobekli
Tepe in Southeast Turkey,

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.200 align:middle line:10%
who suggested that the
Anunnaki were the founders

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:10%
of civilization and that the
complex of Gobekli Tepe was

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:10%
described in Sumerian
mythology as the Du-ku Mount.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
The Du-ku Mount was the
home of the Anunnaki.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was said
that from here they

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle line:84%
gave to humanity the rudiments
of agriculture and animal

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:90%
husbandry.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:10%
And what he believed is that the
Anunnaki, the memory of them,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:10%
was preserved right the way
down to the Sumerian period.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
created Gobekli Tepe,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
who we know as the
pre-pottery Neolithic culture,

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that carried this
tradition-- and this bloodline,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:90%
if you like--

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
down through the centuries,
through the millennia,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:84%
until eventually they
became the first Sumerians.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And their descendants are us--

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.800 align:middle line:90%
their DNA, their ancestry.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Their lineage and
legacy is within us--

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Anunnaki within all of us.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
But just maybe, that
Anunnaki mindset

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
strong within those

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that have the strongest ancestry
and hopefully something that

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.450 align:middle line:84%
will allow us to
learn more about who

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:84%
these important people
were of the past.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This idea of a hybrid or
mixed biology within the Homo

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:84%
sapien sapien is supported
by many of the writings

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.150 align:middle line:84%
in the texts from the different
civilizations all around

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.350 align:middle line:90%
the planet.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Pre-diluvian sites like Gobekli
Tepe share another consistent

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
theme with other sites
around the planet--

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.053 align:middle line:90%
a cosmic blueprint.

00:20:05.053 --> 00:20:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>> According to the
ancient civilization known

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:84%
as the Babylonians that
came after the Sumerian

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
civilization, there was a star
connection alignment that had

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:84%
once existed for the original
pre-diluvian cities that were

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:90%
created in the Fertile Crescent.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:10%
And we know that because of
an ancient cylinder seal known

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:10%
as the MUL.APIN, which describes
how those original five

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:10%
pre-diluvian cities,
such as Eridu,

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:10%
were created along the banks of
the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:10%
to mimic and map the
star constellation known

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:40.840 align:middle line:10%
as Eridanus, which connects
in the northern part

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:10%
to Gobekli Tepe,
forming a connection all

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:10%
the way from Gobekli Tepe down
through the pre-diluvian cities

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:10%
of the Sumerian, Akkadian,
and Babylonian civilizations.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Some researchers have shown
that the ancient Sumerians

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:10%
aligned their cities to the
constellation of Eridanus,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:10%
"The River of Life."

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:10%
This sets up a whole line
of temples and cities

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.210 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient world that
followed this pattern.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, Dendera in
Egypt is aligned with Sirius.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So it is with the rising of the
dog star, the Light of Sirius,

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
comes through into the temple,
into the holy of holies.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:84%
They refer to this as
"heaven's mirror"--

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
that if you could align a
city with a constellation,

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that it would draw down
into the earth plane

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:84%
the powers of that
heavenly constellation.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea once
again is that we've

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.910 align:middle line:84%
set up effectively a
stargate, or a portal,

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.360 align:middle line:84%
in which the energy of the gods,
or even the gods themselves,

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.750 align:middle line:84%
could enter into the earth
plane and influence positively

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:90%
human affairs.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Evidence around sacred
sites having a strong stellar

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.500 align:middle line:90%
connection is mounting.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:10%
But what was the reasoning
behind this central region

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.910 align:middle line:10%
of the Fertile Crescent being
picked by these Sumerian gods?

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a number of
important ancient and sacred

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
sites that are located on
the 38th parallel above

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.550 align:middle line:90%
the equator.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:10%
They include Giza and Heliopolis
in Egypt, Ur and Eridu

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:10%
in what is today Iraq--

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:10%
these were ancient
Sumerian city states--

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:10%
and also Persepolis,
the main city

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:10%
in what is today Iran but
was in ancient times Persia.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:84%
So we have to ask
ourselves, what

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
was the importance of siting
these important places

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.010 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient world on
this particular latitude?

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:10%
The very simple answer is that
30 degrees above the equator

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:10%
is one third of the
distance between the equator

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:10%
and the North Pole.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But beyond this is the fact
that the 38th parallel relates

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:84%
to the changes that are
brought in by the influence

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
of the equator and the
effects upon the weather

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and the so-called horse winds.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And it creates this zone
of incredible sunny weather

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and high pressure which would
have been seen as particularly

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.660 align:middle line:84%
significant by ancient cultures
so that if they were looking

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:84%
for places to site
their monuments

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
or cities or sacred
temples, that this

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.750 align:middle line:84%
would be seen as a point
that had been singled out

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:84%
as important by the
gods themselves.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Solving the riddle of what
exactly happened in the Fertile

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Crescent tens of
thousands of years ago,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.130 align:middle line:84%
before the great deluge, is
not just an idle pastime.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It helps explain how
we came to be here

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.870 align:middle line:84%
at this time on this
planet in this way.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And understanding
where we came from

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship to
the rest of the universe

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:84%
is important to our
survival as a species.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:10%
At some point in our
history, the Fertile Crescent

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:10%
may have become the jumping
off place for humans

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:10%
to spread out into other
parts of the planet.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, where
did the gods disappear to?

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible the
ancient Sumerian cuneiform

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:10%
tablets may also hold the key
to understanding the transition

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.730 align:middle line:10%
from Anunnaki to human control
over the Fertile Crescent?

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.950 align:middle line:84%
As mainstream
catches up with some

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
of the most influential
alternative research,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:90%
one thing is for certain--

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
something extraordinary happened
in the Fertile Crescent,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.400 align:middle line:84%
where humans were passed
down knowledge from the gods.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
But as with all
heroes on a journey,

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:84%
the road of trials and tests
isn't designed to be easy.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It is designed to make
the hero stronger.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:18.000 align:middle line:90%
