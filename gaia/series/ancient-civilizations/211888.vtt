00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout the planet,
mysterious megalithic

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
structures, tunnel systems, and
monuments lay in various states

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.480 align:middle line:90%
of ruin.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Most of them appear to
have been constructed to be

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:90%
aligned with the ancient sky.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
From Turkey to South America,
several of these relics

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
are thought to be
clues to a time

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.100 align:middle line:84%
before the legendary
destruction of Atlantis

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:90%
roughly 11,600 years ago.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
These megalithic
wonders appear to have

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
been built to survive
the great cataclysms that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:90%
are woven throughout mythology.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of the
legend, there's

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
a tale of a time when
Earth's ancestors began

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:90%
preparing for what was coming.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.922 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:27.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So when we talk about
the kind of catastrophe

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.090 align:middle line:10%
on the magnitude and the
scale that we're talking about

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:10%
in the Younger Dryas, and we
talk about the civilizations

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:10%
that existed during
that period of time,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:10%
if they were not immediately
impacted by the event itself,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.150 align:middle line:10%
they would have been impacted
by the aftermath of the event.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:90%
How would they have responded?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I think we see evidence of that
in civilizations and cultures

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that tried to preserve what
it is they had created.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:84%
They buried what
they had created.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And we see evidence of
this in South America.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:90%
We see it in Caral in Peru.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And very, very
specifically, we see it

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
in Gobekli Tepe, where
we see the evidence

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
of the circular temples buried
intentionally under the earth.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't natural erosion
that covered these temples.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.490 align:middle line:84%
There was human
intervention that

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:90%
covered these intentionally.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.900 align:middle line:84%
We can only speculate the reason
because they left no written

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:90%
records.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Very possibly, they
covered to preserve

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.290 align:middle line:84%
what they had created
for future generations

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.001 align:middle line:84%
so that we can see
them as we do today.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Experts have studied the
site and they believe that

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:84%
the amount of time that was
taken to bury and protect

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
the site after it was created
may have taken just as much

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:84%
time as it did to
create the structure.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:10%
Showing us that that site was
incredibly important to those

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:10%
civilizations to protect it.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:10%
And that they knew that
something was coming that they

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.850 align:middle line:10%
needed to protect the site.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:10%
>> But whoever
built Gobekli Tepe,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:10%
the fact that they buried
that very important 30 acres

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:10%
of these rings of all of
these limestone columns meant

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:10%
somebody knew that something
potentially destructive

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:10%
to the whole planet, and
they didn't want Gobekli Tepe

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:10%
destroyed.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.576 align:middle line:90%
But Gobekli Tepe survived.

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at Gobekli
Tepe and the earliest carbon-14

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.470 align:middle line:84%
dating for Enclosure D,
which is the most important,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.340 align:middle line:84%
focuses on the arc made by
the first rising of the belt

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
of Orion 10,450 BC, Saint-Denis
construction as the Assyrian,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and many other places
around the world.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:10%
So these things
preceded the event.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:10%
So they were already
building, they already

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:10%
come from somewhere else,
like the Egyptian said,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:10%
the homelands of the gods were
already partially destroyed.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:10%
So that puts us at the
beginning of the Younger Dryas.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
setting out in boats

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.753 align:middle line:84%
with all of their
astrologers and astronomers,

00:04:03.753 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out whether
can they live because they've

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
already seen ahead.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
They know this is
going to happen again

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to have
about 800 years of time

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:90%
to get their act together.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.131 align:middle line:84%
They're going out
and stretching out

00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:90%
across the face of the Earth.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to think forward.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to build
for the next catastrophe

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
build big because they

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.830 align:middle line:84%
know that one when
it happens, it's

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:90%
going to obliterate everything.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And that accounts for the
megalithic use of stone.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why not make
it easy for yourself.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Get a rock that big.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
No, we'll use one
1,800 tons in weight

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
like in Baalbek, which
nothing on Earth can lift.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Now why would you do that?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:90%
A, because you can.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And two, because you
want to make sure

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to go anywhere.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.643 align:middle line:10%
So you put all of
these ideas together,

00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:10%
it becomes very obvious
that they were already

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:10%
building to prevent and overcome
a future cataclysm which

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:10%
was already 800 years
into the future.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.898 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.898 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Another tale from the time
when humanity was preparing

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.370 align:middle line:84%
for cataclysm comes from
the Hopi in northern Arizona

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:90%
in the western United States.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Alternative
researchers have long

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.490 align:middle line:84%
speculated that the legendary
ant people were likely

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
a group of beings that had all
intentions of helping humanity.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:10%
The depictions of the ant
people add a deeper mystery

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:10%
to their connection
with the legendary myths

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:10%
from around the planet, where
a group of sages or wise ones

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.635 align:middle line:10%
helped humanity
through the dark times.

00:05:37.635 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The Hopi talk about
a series of worlds.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:10%
The first world was
destroyed by fire.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:10%
The second world was
destroyed by ice.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:10%
And both of these
situations, they

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.900 align:middle line:10%
followed a mysterious cloud
during the day and a moving

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:10%
star at night
until they were led

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:10%
to their chief god
who introduced them

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.240 align:middle line:10%
to the ant people.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The ant people then take the
Hopi into underground caverns

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and teach them
how to grow beans,

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:84%
how to survive through
these cataclysms.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:10%
And then ultimately, they're
led out of the underground world

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:10%
into the surface
world once again.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.170 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
this, you think, well,

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:90%
who are these ant people?

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Do they literally
look like ants?

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:90%
There's no suggestion of that.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in descriptions or
depictions of them in rock art,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
they're portrayed more
like Egyptian high priests.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And you ask, well, who could
these high priests possibly be?

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Could they-- might possibly
have been the Atlanteans,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
the survivors that are
teaching the Hopi how

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.190 align:middle line:84%
to enter into a period of stasis
to survive these cataclysms?

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Or if not, who were
the ant people?

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.525 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.525 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>> How many of the great flood
stories are prefaced by some

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
favored individual being
pre-informed of the impending

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:90%
event over and over again?

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, then that raises
the question of, well,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:10%
who would that have been?

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:10%
I look at the myths, and one
of the most widespread myths

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:10%
from all of these cultures is
the myth of the Great Flood.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, my geological
research tells me

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:90%
that the great floods were real.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we go from
the thought that

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.920 align:middle line:84%
behind many of these
myths of gigantic floods

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
are very real events, then what
is the potential real reality

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:84%
behind the stories
of the gods that all

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient cultures have?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens there
is most people immediately

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.850 align:middle line:90%
want to go to aliens.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not dismissing
the idea of aliens.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But instead of immediately
jumping to aliens,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
let us consider the possibility
that you might have had,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.317 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times, cultures
existing side by side

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
that were, on the
one hand, primitive,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
but on the other hand, very
sophisticated and advanced.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.470 align:middle line:84%
This advanced culture now
knows that something's

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.000 align:middle line:90%
about to happen.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
trying to disseminate

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that knowledge and
that information

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:90%
to as many people as possible.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Hey, there's going to
be something coming.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
a gigantic flood.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you consider
building a big boat?

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Maybe out of reeds or going
underground with the ant people

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case may be.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Because over and
over and over again,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:84%
we find that theme replicated
in these ancient stories.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think just like
now we can consider

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:84%
the great floods were
real, historically real,

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:90%
then who were these gods?

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:90%
It may have been us.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Throughout mythology, there
are countless deities devoted

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:10%
to the sun.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Ancient practices that center
around solstices and equinoxes

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
are embedded in cultures
around the planet.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
This divine provider of life
has been an all-seeing eye

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:90%
throughout Earth's evolution.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.870 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we look
deeper into the heart

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system
to understand

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:84%
the increase of
catastrophic events

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.505 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the Younger Dryas?

00:09:26.505 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I am convinced that the
Younger Dryas is bracketed

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:90%
by solar outbursts.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.200 align:middle line:10%
What I believe all the evidence
indicates is that at 9,700 BC,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:10%
there was another
major solar outburst.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
At that point, though, there are
not these huge glacial lakes,

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:10%
And that major solar outburst
has the opposite effect

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:10%
on the climate.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.790 align:middle line:10%
It drives the climate
into a warming period.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:10%
Because when you have
this major solar outburst

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the last Ice
Age, huge thunderbolts are not

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:10%
atmospheric thunder,
they're coming from the sun

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:10%
and they would literally touch
down, melt ice when it hits it.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
You have incredible flooding
on the surface of the Earth.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:84%
You have increased
earthquake activity.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.200 align:middle line:84%
You have increased
volcanic activity.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:90%
You have a rising sea levels.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.270 align:middle line:84%
It would cause, in
some cases, wildfires.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Then there's
another twist to it,

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.080 align:middle line:84%
which is when you have a major
solar outburst, in some cases,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
it's now known from other stars
similar to our star, which we

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
know is the sun, that you can
have not only plasma thrown

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
off, but also essentially
particulate matter

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that can congeal and
form physical impactors.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:00.270 align:middle line:10%
So it starts to get to the
point where one and the other

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:10%
are not so
diametrically opposed,

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:10%
where evidence for
some kind of impactor,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:10%
evidence for a solar
outburst, they overlap.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:16.530 align:middle line:10%
Still, I am 100% convinced that
all of the evidence looking

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:10%
at it in its totality points
to major solar outbursts,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:30.705 align:middle line:10%
particularly at 9,700 BCE, at
the end of the last Ice Age.

00:11:30.705 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the melting
of the great ice sheet complex,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:84%
yes, we see melting
from the snout.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
But we also see melting
epicenters hundreds

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
of not even like 1,000 miles
up removed from the snout.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
If you think of the
ice sheet coming,

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:57.160 align:middle line:84%
encroaching upon northern United
States, which it did, and we

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
know now that the northern
United States is warmer

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
than Canada, go
closer to the poles,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
the temperature gets
colder and colder.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:84%
During the peak of
the Ice Age, you

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
had ice that might have been
2 miles thick over the region

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:84%
of central Canada,
Hudson Bay, that

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
reached all the way
to the Atlantic Ocean

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and beyond the present
coastline all the way

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.120 align:middle line:84%
to the Pacific Ocean, and
from the northern United

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:90%
States up to the Arctic Circle.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole lot of ice
you got to get rid of.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, did it shrink back
uniformly from the edges?

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:90%
No, it didn't.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:84%
But what you do would expect
is that it should shrink back

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
at an average rate on
the southern margin

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
faster than on the
northern margin.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:90%
That didn't happen.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It's like all over the ice
sheet, it began to melt.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:10%
And there were
melting epicenters

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:10%
that you can actually now
study maps or even go there,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:10%
and you'll see that
there are landforms

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:10%
consistent with a tremendous
radial outrush of waters

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:10%
from these melting epicenters.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't
really make sense

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:84%
within the normal models
of glacier recession.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Something else was
going on there.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the most
consistent explanation

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.181 align:middle line:84%
would be hypervelocity impacts
directly into the ice sheet.

00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Virtually overnight, global
temperatures go from cold Ice

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Age conditions to essentially
modern warm conditions.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
When you put huge amounts of
moisture into the atmosphere,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.430 align:middle line:84%
it can only hold
so much so long.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And it has to come out, and
we see incredible rains.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
last Ice Age, we

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.270 align:middle line:84%
have evidence of this
geologically, so flash

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:90%
flooding.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this
flooding, I am convinced

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
is not just rising sea levels
but flooding on the surface

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:84%
from incredible rainstorms,
incredible thunderstorms

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:90%
in a sense.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:10%
So it was really
a dramatic time.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:10%
And this ties right in with my
work on the Great Sphinx, which

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:10%
I first began in 1990.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:10%
One of the first
things I observed

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.910 align:middle line:10%
as a PhD geologist
and geophysicist

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:10%
was that the weathering
on the body of the Sphinx

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:10%
and the walls of the Sphinx
enclosure, that weathering

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:10%
and erosion is not
by wind and sand.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:84%
It is not what you
expect in a desert,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.130 align:middle line:84%
it's what you expect from
fairly significant rainfall

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.070 align:middle line:84%
over a considerable
period of time.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
You have what I refer to
as a rolling, undulating,

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:90%
weathering, and erosion profile.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
You have vertical
fissures that would

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
be caused by water runoff,
running down, and finding areas

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that are relatively
weak, and then it

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:90%
carves it out as fissures.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this very
clearly as a geologist

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the walls
of the Sphinx enclosure.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:84%
The receding back more
towards the top of the section

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%
than the bottom of the section.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:84%
There have been Nile floods
coming in, for instance,

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:90%
consistently.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
You would get much
more undercutting

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
of the softer layers which
occur toward the base.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.960 align:middle line:90%
So it's not Nile flooding.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:90%
It is definitely rainfall.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that
rainfall was initiated

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the last
Ice Age, circa 9,700 BCE,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.200 align:middle line:84%
because we know that there
were tremendous rains

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and tremendous runoff
at that time period.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So it starts to all fit
absolutely together.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It was such a dramatic
change that most people have no

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:84%
comprehension of what
we're talking about here.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:84%
A series of solar outbursts,
coronal mass ejections,

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:12.770 align:middle line:84%
impacts, tremendous storms,
fires, gigantic earthquakes,

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
extraordinarily erosive
floods, and volcanic eruptions.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:90%
It was a complete alteration.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole natural
history of this planet

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that occurred at the end
of the Younger Dryas.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And really, launched
the Holocene,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.020 align:middle line:84%
which is our modern epoch where
our modern civilization has

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
arisen out of the debris of that
former world that got utterly

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:42.074 align:middle line:90%
obliterated in the process.

00:16:42.074 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the extreme events
throughout the Younger Dryas

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:50.760 align:middle line:10%
period have been powerful
enough to drastically shift

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:10%
Earth's axis?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
According to mainstream science,
Earth's current axial tilt

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:90%
is roughly 23.5 degrees.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
The axial tilt
determines the seasons,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:84%
and water distribution
around the planet

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:90%
can drastically affect the axis.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
A recent study revealed that
humans pumping groundwater

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:90%
shifted the axis of the Earth.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
If a watery planet exploded
in our solar system,

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:84%
and the sun responded with an
extreme solar proton event,

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
melting an incomprehensible
amount of ice

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth's
polar region, and then

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the Earth was pelted by
a massive fragmenting icy

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
comet as well as a large
amount of water and debris

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:84%
from the exploded
planet, how quickly

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
would the Earth move
to reestablish balance

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
with the new water weight
and shift to its current axis

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:90%
of roughly 23.5 degrees?

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:10%
In the 1950s,
professor and author

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:10%
Hans Schindler Bellamy
co-authored a book named

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.760 align:middle line:10%
"The Calendar of Tiahuanaco."

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.320 align:middle line:84%
This controversial book claims
that the sun gate of Tiahuanaco

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.400 align:middle line:84%
in Bolivia is a calendar for
more than 12,000 years ago.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And that this calendar differs
from our present day calendar

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
because the Earth had
a different axial tilt.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Could an abrupt axis
shift thousands of years

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:84%
ago have increased the power
of the ever-growing oceans

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and caused more
fault lines to quake

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and create massive tsunamis?

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Evidence from Siberia
deepens the mystery

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:43.080 align:middle line:84%
of how quickly climates changed
during this chaotic time that

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.530 align:middle line:90%
defies comprehension.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.260 align:middle line:10%
>> In order to understand
the significance of these

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:10%
Earth's catastrophes during
the Younger Dryas period,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:10%
we have to go back to the late
1800s and early 1900s to a man

00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:10%
named Edward Toll, who was the
first expedition to ever go up

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:10%
into northern Siberia to study
the megafauna that had gone

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:10%
extinct in the Earth's climate.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Edward Toll described
in his journals

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.910 align:middle line:84%
as finding a 30-foot alder
tree hundreds of miles

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:90%
north into the Siberian tundra.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
This brought up
several questions

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
from scientists such
as why a 30-foot alder

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
tree was growing hundreds of
miles north into the Arctic

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Circle where it shouldn't be.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, how could a
tree with green leaves

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
be found flash frozen
in this type of state?

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Edward Toll found answers
when he was searching around

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
the area of new Siberian
islands with finding

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of frozen mammoths.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The most famous eventually
being discovered

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.060 align:middle line:84%
called the Berezovka
mammoth, which

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.060 align:middle line:84%
is famous because the
mammoth was preserved almost

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:90%
in its entirety.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the story
of what Toll said he found with

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:84%
this tree along
with the mammoths,

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.540 align:middle line:84%
it becomes apparent to us that
this was a cataclysmic type

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.375 align:middle line:84%
freezing, like an
instant freezing.

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
that happened

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.220 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:10%
When they found
the mammoths, they

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:10%
would find grass in their
mouths with the molar print

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:10%
still on the grass, indicating
that this was fresh grass,

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.270 align:middle line:10%
this was a fresh instance, and
this happened just literally

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:10%
like a lightning, this freezing.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a period of time
when it was pretty much hell

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
When you think about it, half
of the great megafaunal species

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
of the planet disappeared
in a geological eye blink.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you make a list
of the animals that

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
didn't make it across
the Younger Dryas,

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:90%
it's a huge list.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:10%
>> The evidence for
cosmic impacts and sort

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:10%
of the catastrophic nature
of the Younger Dryas

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:10%
and the megafaunal extinction
isn't purely limited to just

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:10%
the bones that we find in
the species extinction.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.468 align:middle line:84%
There happen to be some
examples of just what seemed

00:20:57.468 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:84%
to be things like
mammoths that were caught

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:90%
in just tremendous blast waves.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is a good
example of what

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
might have happened if
some of these megafauna

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:84%
were exposed to things
like cosmic airbursts.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:84%
There are burial
sites today where

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
you've got rearranged
skeletons of mammoths

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
where their feet
were embedded in mud,

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and their leg bones
were literally

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.020 align:middle line:84%
snapped off at the top,
and their hip bones

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.310 align:middle line:90%
are up around their skulls.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And just the force it requires
to snap an elephant femur

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:90%
would be tremendous.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But there are also
a number of caves

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:84%
where we've got
megafaunal species, just

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
cave bears and saber-toothed
tigers and mammoths all

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:84%
jumbled together along with
busted up wood and trees

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:84%
as if a blast wave had
just scoured the Earth

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.210 align:middle line:90%
and smashed everything together.

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:46.955 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of evidence
for a catastrophic end to some

00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:47.755 align:middle line:90%
of these species.

00:21:47.755 --> 00:21:50.475 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Earth's axis have
changed so abruptly that new

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Arctic zones were
created in an instant?

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Could this axis shift
have caused land masses

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:90%
to abruptly sink?

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
The ancient legends
claim that Atlantis

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.220 align:middle line:90%
was destroyed very quickly.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:84%
A deeper look at the
mid-Atlantic ridge

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:84%
provides a geological
understanding

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.380 align:middle line:84%
of what could happen if
Mother Earth was quickly

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.052 align:middle line:90%
thrown off-balance.

00:22:23.052 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There is very striking
empirical evidence that

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.190 align:middle line:84%
the ocean bottom, particularly
along the mid-Atlantic ridge,

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:90%
subsided.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:10%
There is a plateau,
called the Azores Plateau,

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.950 align:middle line:10%
it's about the size of Iceland.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.320 align:middle line:10%
And it flanks the
mid-Atlantic ridge.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, it sits at what's
called a triple plate junction.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
You have the African
plate, the Eurasian plate,

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and the North American plate all
meet right there at the Azores.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And where they meet, I think
that's a natural hinge point

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and there are cross-transecting
the mid-Atlantic ridge

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:84%
at right angles are what
are called transform faults.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And those transform
faults could be

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:84%
seen as the natural consequence
of this movement of the Earth's

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:90%
crust.

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the consequences of
that would be this changing,

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.640 align:middle line:90%
shifting landmasses.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at what are
called the bathymetric charts,

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.990 align:middle line:10%
the charts of the ocean
bottom of the Atlantic,

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:10%
you will see what is
called the Azores Plateau.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:10%
What are now the Azores islands
are mountains on that plateau.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Those islands are literally
the peaks of mountains.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back to
the Ice Age and we

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:84%
factor in both the isostatic
movement of the ocean

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
bottom and the sea level bottom,
it becomes very plausible

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
that the plateau could have
been above water at the time.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the readings from
Edgar Cayce and the stories told

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.650 align:middle line:10%
by Plato be pointing us
to this volatile area

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:10%
of the mid-Atlantic ridge?

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:10%
Could this be the location
of the legendary center

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:10%
of Atlantis beyond the
Pillars of Hercules

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:10%
that was destroyed when
the Earth transitioned out

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:10%
of the Younger Dryas and
rapidly shifted to its new axis

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:10%
around 11,600 years ago?

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:84%
As science searches
for answers of how

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.020 align:middle line:84%
this anomalous geological
time period ended,

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:84%
there are two prevailing
themes that keep recurring.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:84%
During the Younger Dryas,
all cycles and patterns

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.860 align:middle line:84%
were drastically
altered and water

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
is the prevailing
element that is

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.575 align:middle line:84%
woven throughout
these legendary tales.

00:24:41.575 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the evidence for
flooding is incontrovertible.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Even mainstream science now
admits the age of reason

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and the Age of Enlightenment, it
was the development of science

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:84%
was an attempt to get away from
the catastrophism of religion.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And this gave rise to
concepts like gradualism

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.720 align:middle line:84%
and uniformitarianism, and
particularly with geology

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.510 align:middle line:84%
for like 60, 70 years, it was
a stated goal of that science

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:84%
to explain everything
we see based

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:84%
on the gradual
processes of erosion

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.100 align:middle line:84%
and gentle change that we
can observe everywhere.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:84%
That's now started to be,
I think, a bit corrected.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Like some of this catastrophism
is coming back in.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Even now, the
mainstream science has

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
accepted that, yes, the
end of the last Ice Age

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.200 align:middle line:84%
gave rise to these just
catastrophic flood events.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It's incontrovertible that
there were cataclysmic floods

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:90%
during that period.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We're coming out of a century
or more of models of Earth

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:84%
change and Earth history
that are very gradualistic.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So the assumption
is that a cave would

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:84%
have been produced over
hundreds of thousands,

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
even millions of years, one drop
of water at a time scenario.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, that has been on its
way out since the early 1980s.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.600 align:middle line:84%
With the discovery of
the dinosaur killer,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:84%
it opened up the possibility
that maybe, well,

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.300 align:middle line:84%
maybe we need to consider that
catastrophic episodes really

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:90%
do happen.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that the
gradualistic processes aren't

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:84%
working, but one catastrophe
in a matter of a year

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
can do more work than
tens of thousands

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.795 align:middle line:90%
of years of gradualistic change.

00:26:23.795 --> 00:26:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the evidence
from a scientific perspective,

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:32.720 align:middle line:84%
what we have to say is that
whatever happened to melt

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:84%
the ice in the time of the
Younger Dryas so quickly,

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:84%
some event, an
extraordinary event--

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:84%
if it were happening
today in the modern world,

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
we would call it a
black swan event,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:84%
something that created such a
powerful effect on the Earth

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.550 align:middle line:84%
that the human population by
some estimates was decimated

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
down to only a few hundred
thousand from what it was

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
at that time, that it forced
human migrations in ways that

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:84%
we had never seen before
as the sea levels rose.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
So they became
isolated populations

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that began to rebuild or
repopulate and regrow,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:84%
developing the technologies
that they had in their memory

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
from when there was
a common connection.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
one of the reasons why

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:23.230 align:middle line:84%
we see such continuity
of human knowledge

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:84%
that range all the way from
the architecture that allows

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:84%
the building of pyramidal
structures using

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.580 align:middle line:84%
megalithic stone blocks,
no mortar, high tolerances

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.050 align:middle line:90%
between those blocks.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.990 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, the
mathematics that allows

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.710 align:middle line:10%
for that kind of construction,
the cosmology that

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:10%
tells us about our relationship
to the sun when the growing

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.600 align:middle line:10%
seasons end, when they begin.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Our relationship to
very key star systems

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.740 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be uniform
throughout these civilizations

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and we have to ask ourselves,
how could this be possible

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.620 align:middle line:84%
unless there was a time
that there was communication

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:90%
between those civilizations.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And if there was
that time, it would

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.940 align:middle line:84%
have been before the
time of this catastrophe.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
are the remnants

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:84%
of that catastrophe and the
civilizations rebuilding

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.852 align:middle line:84%
to become the world
that we know today.

00:28:16.852 --> 00:28:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>> The origins of our most
cherished ancient myths that

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.940 align:middle line:10%
encapsulated the strength
and bravery of our ancient

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:10%
ancestors now has science to
provide a potential time frame

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.610 align:middle line:10%
where humanity rose to great
technological and spiritual

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:10%
heights and defied the laws
of nature before a sequence

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.775 align:middle line:10%
of catastrophes
ravaged this planet.

00:28:40.775 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:84%
There is little doubt that
the previous world nearly

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:90%
ended with the Younger Dryas.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:54.380 align:middle line:84%
But the question remains,
how drastically did the fires

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and floods change the
face of the planet

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and redirect the course
of human evolution?

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:90%
