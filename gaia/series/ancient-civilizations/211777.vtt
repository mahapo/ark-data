00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> According to mythological
and geological records,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
roughly 12,800 to
12,900 years ago,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
the Earth was drastically
changed by a cosmic event.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Trapped under the surface
of this majestic planet

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
is an ancient record that holds
the clues to a time on Earth

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
when all geological patterns
and cycles were broken

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth was
ravaged by floods

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:84%
and plunged back into a
frozen and dark time known

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:90%
as the Younger Dryas period.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a mystery that
exists even today that the great

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:10%
scientists of our world
continue to speculate on.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:10%
And they have to speculate,
because the truth

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:10%
is, we do not know
precisely what happened

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:10%
during a mysterious period of
time called the Younger Dryas.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a mystery because
of the sudden shift

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.380 align:middle line:84%
in climate, the sudden
shift in the sea levels.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.620 align:middle line:84%
We're left only with
the clues that tell us

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:90%
that these events happened.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:10%
It's up to us to determine what
caused the events themselves.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:10%
Why did they happen?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:10%
During the Pleistocene, the
glaciers were at their maximum.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:10%
We were coming out
of this Ice Age.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:10%
There was a warming that
was happening on the planet,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:10%
as you would expect through
the cyclic conditions

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:10%
that we have seen in the past.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.710 align:middle line:84%
These cycles often
are driven by what

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:90%
are called Milankovitch cycles.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:84%
This is Earth's dance
around the sun in space.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:84%
It is a tilt, an
angle, and a wobble

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
that changes our
relationship to the sun,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:84%
periodically causing
temperatures to rise and fall.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And we were on course
for this gradual warming

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:90%
when something happened.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's this mystery that is
at the root of the controversy

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.820 align:middle line:90%
that we're seeing today.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's at the
root of what may be

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
the cause for the loss of
the great civilizations

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.315 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about Mu and Atlantis.

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:10%
>> The ice core samples that
we've dug up from various

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.890 align:middle line:10%
locations, particularly
Greenland, also Russia,

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:10%
have shown a number of things
relating to the Younger Dryas.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Every year on glaciers when
the snowfall lands and it gets

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:84%
compacted into ice, every
year, year after year,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
there are these
layers of ice that get

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
built up in the ice
structure itself.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you drill down and
take a core sample of ice,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
our science is
progressing to the point

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
where we can individually
look at a single year,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
a single layer inside
of that ice core

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and determine from things
like oxygen isotopes, things

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.130 align:middle line:84%
like global temperature, the
amount of evidence for, say,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.080 align:middle line:84%
things like massive
biomass burnings,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the
things that shows up

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
in these ice cores related
to the Younger Dryas.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, our science has
really progressed to a point

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:10%
now where we can show that
during the Younger Dryas,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:10%
there was huge temperature
swings up to 10 to 12 degrees

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:10%
across the planet that
might have happened

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:10%
within a decade or even
less, say four or five years,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:10%
which is just a catastrophic
temperature swing that

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:10%
would have really
changed the climate

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.885 align:middle line:10%
on the planet in dramatic ways.

00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at these ice
core samples from Greenland,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:10%
it gives us this perfect
snapshot to understanding what

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:10%
the climate of the Earth was
like during the Younger Dryas

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:10%
period.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:10%
We had this plummeting
of temperatures followed

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:10%
by a rapid rise that
the end of the Younger

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:10%
Dryas leading to a much
warmer and stable climate.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, it means that
the Younger Dryas

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:10%
period had multiple
different events that

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:10%
seemed to have occurred.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:10%
The fascinating thing is that
those trends and those spikes

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.800 align:middle line:10%
in those temperatures as
well as following CO2,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:10%
they match the descriptions we
have of when this volatile time

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:10%
period destroyed civilizations
around the world.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And around that
12,800, 900 year boundary,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
we find something called
the Younger Dryas layer.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:10%
And we find this layer
all around the world

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:10%
in areas from North
America to the tip of South

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:10%
America in Chile.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:10%
We also find the Younger Dryas
boundaries in South Africa

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:10%
as well as in Europe.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.900 align:middle line:10%
In fact, most of
these indicators,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:10%
at least in the early
days of this work,

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:10%
came from archaeological
sites in North America,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:10%
the Clovis sites that go back
to around 13,000 years ago.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very well
defined strata layer

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.840 align:middle line:84%
that we see in
the ground that we

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:90%
can define to specific dates.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And this consists of
a black matte layer.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And just below that,
we also find what

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:90%
we would term impact proxies.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Things like shock
synthesized nanodiamonds,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
magnetic spherules,
large quantities

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial platinum
and iridium metal groups.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
These proxies are
really only formed

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:84%
in the extremely
high temperature

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:84%
conditions that occur
during cosmic airbursts

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:90%
and cosmic impacts.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
A cosmic airburst is
essentially a cosmic body

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.650 align:middle line:84%
coming into the
atmosphere and instead

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:84%
of burning up smaller
particles when they come in,

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
meteor showers when
we see them, that's

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
a piece of rock or something
from a meteor stream burning up

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:90%
in the atmosphere.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But if you have a
large enough body,

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
it might come into
the atmosphere

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and just be heated up by that
transit through the atmosphere

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and then explode.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Essentially like a nuclear
bomb going off in the sky.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Geologic evidence
from around the world,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and scientists are looking at
this Younger Dryas boundary

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.610 align:middle line:84%
layer, that tells us that was
the time period and that was

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.060 align:middle line:84%
the place in history where
cataclysms across the Earth

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
from volcanism to potentially
extreme solar events to even

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:90%
cosmic impacts.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>> In the ice core samples, we
can see the evidence for just

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.330 align:middle line:90%
tremendous biomass burning.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.160 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
something in the order

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
of 10 million square
kilometers of the biomass

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, which could
have been as much as 8% or 9%

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
of biomass burning
during this period.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.150 align:middle line:84%
This may have triggered the
nuclear winter effect that

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.060 align:middle line:84%
actually was a leading
cause to the deep freeze,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the deep plunge back to
a glacial maximum state

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
of temperatures that occurred
after the start of the Younger

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Dryas.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:10%
>> To understand what happened
12 and 13,000 years ago,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:10%
we have to go beyond
just the Earth.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.640 align:middle line:10%
We have to look at
this whole solar system

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:10%
as a unified system
and that something

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:10%
can then disrupt that.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look to the beginning
of the Younger Dryas and we see

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:10%
the various calamities
and catastrophes that hit

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.900 align:middle line:10%
our planet, we have to
wonder where this comes from.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
In between Mars and
Jupiter, there's an area

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
asteroid belt. And

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.830 align:middle line:84%
inside this mysterious
belt, there's

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
over a million different
asteroids that are over a half

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.610 align:middle line:90%
a mile in diameter.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, there is a major
debate as to the origin

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:10%
of this asteroid
belt. But if we look

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.400 align:middle line:10%
to ancient Sumerian texts
like the "Enuma Elish"

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.890 align:middle line:10%
or "The Law of One"
in modern times,

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:10%
we hear that the
debris in this field

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:10%
comes from the remains of
a giant watery planet that

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.620 align:middle line:10%
was destroyed.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
There's been various
names for this planet

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:84%
like Tiamat and Mulge,
Nibiru, Phaethon, even Maldek.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Tiamat disintegrates into
however many pieces becomes,

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:84%
the asteroid belt circling the
sun between Mars and Jupiter.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
What if there are
fragments of that planet

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:90%
that escape that orbit?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes the comet that
triggers the Younger Dryas.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:10%
Many researchers believe
that the Younger Dryas

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:10%
is caused by a cometary impact.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, where did that
comet originate from?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible this was
a fragment of Tiamat that

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:84%
actually escapes the orbit
that it was originally

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
in and destroys
much of what we know

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:90%
of as ancient civilization?

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at
the solar system,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.198 align:middle line:84%
we have to remember that all
of the bodies are connected

00:08:50.198 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:84%
through the gravity of the
sun, which holds the planets

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:90%
in place.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to have
one of those planets,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.830 align:middle line:84%
especially the size of
Tiamat, explode, that

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
would throw off
that gravity balance

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
whole solar system,

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
causing the sun to go in
such a violent uprising,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%
kicking out solar proton
outbursts and coronal mass

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:90%
ejections.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
These things are
hitting the Earth,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
causing vitrification and
fires all over the planet.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
But let's not forget
the water of Tiamat.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.730 align:middle line:10%
The gravity of the sun
is pulling that water

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:10%
toward the center
of the solar system.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.220 align:middle line:84%
That is racing towards
the Earth and that water

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
crashing into the
Earth would have

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:84%
caused flooding and
upswells of water

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:90%
throughout all the planet.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:45.170 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely a very
massive time period of upheaval.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Recent geologic evidence is
showing us beyond any shadow

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:10%
of a doubt that there was an
incoming object that fragmented

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:10%
in our atmosphere, creating
hundreds of thousands

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:10%
of impacts that range all the
way from the northern latitudes

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:10%
in Greenland and Newfoundland
all the way down into South

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:10%
Africa.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>> There's tremendous evidence
now in scientific literature,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
mostly led by the
Comet Research Group,

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that supports the idea that
it was a series of airbursts

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and cosmic impacts that likely
triggered the Younger Dryas

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:90%
event around 12,800 years ago.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:84%
This would have been the impacts
of probably multiple mile

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.530 align:middle line:84%
wide impactors across
the northern hemisphere

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.400 align:middle line:84%
of the planet and also
a series of airbursts.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.455 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
just a single impact.

00:10:33.455 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Most of the evidence
now points towards it

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
being a series of
impacts and airbursts

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.545 align:middle line:84%
that occurred that
started the Younger Dryas.

00:10:44.545 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the interesting things
geologically that tells us this

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:58.110 align:middle line:84%
happened is that first we can
see now with Earth imaging

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:84%
radar, we can see the impact
craters in places where we

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
never thought to look
for craters before.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We can see them in the shallow
water of the sea shelf.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.640 align:middle line:84%
We can see them on land masses
where we never expected craters

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.020 align:middle line:90%
to exist.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:10%
Geologically, what we're
seeing is traces, high traces

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.790 align:middle line:10%
of the element platinum.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:10%
And we're seeing
it in the absence

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:10%
of iridium, another element.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is important from
a geologic perspective.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:10%
Iridium is a transition metal
that is in the platinum family.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So naturally
occurring platinum you

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
would expect to see
with iridium deposits.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.280 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing in
the meteor craters

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:84%
is standalone platinum
without the iridium.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
geologists interpret this

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.180 align:middle line:84%
is that that platinum is of
an extraterrestrial origin.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean aliens and UFOs.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It means that an object came
from beyond our planet that

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
was rich in the platinum that
is relatively rare on Earth

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and that that platinum was not
part of the iridium platinum

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:84%
sequence that you
would typically

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:84%
see if it were naturally
occurring on Earth.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Our whole planetary system
is covered completely with

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:10%
craters.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.070 align:middle line:10%
Not only the moon.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:10%
Our planet Earth has
more than 900 craters.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Normally nobody speaks about
it because you don't see them.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.700 align:middle line:90%
They are under vegetation.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.755 align:middle line:84%
They are under
forest, in the desert.

00:12:26.755 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The United States sent
a probe into a comet,

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Comet Tempel 1.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And they do this analysis
of its composition.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:90%
It was a small comet.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:10%
It looks to have been a
fragment of a larger object.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:10%
It didn't have a central core.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
But this Comet Tempel 1
was roughly 75% open space.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:90%
2/3 of its mass was ice water.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> A comet can have an
enormous amount of rocky debris

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:84%
entrained within its icy
mass along with hydrocarbons,

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
along with volatiles,
gases, cosmic dust.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So a comet can actually induce
some pretty significant changes

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:90%
into the biosphere.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>> With impact craters around
the planet Earth and new

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
evidence about the structure of
comets, the question remains,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
was all of the Earth's extra
water held only in the polar

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.650 align:middle line:90%
ice?

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Or was a vast amount more
delivered at the beginning

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:90%
of the Younger Dryas period?

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>> 12,800 years ago, there
was a major cosmic impact.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.590 align:middle line:84%
This delivered more
than two miles of water

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:90%
to the former abysses.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.510 align:middle line:84%
The object that delivered
the flood has many names.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:90%
One of which is Phaethon.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Phaethon impacted the Earth.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
It delivered roughly more
than two miles of water

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:90%
to the abyssal plains.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, it
shed huge ice chunks.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Geologists know
there was an impact.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.930 align:middle line:84%
We can find impacts in
North America, South Africa,

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and some people think
there are impacts even

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, which would mean
that Phaethon was real high up

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.120 align:middle line:84%
on its Earth approach and
it was shedding these things

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:90%
over a wide distribution.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.090 align:middle line:84%
When Phaethon hit
and its ice started

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
melting and those
waters started coursing

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.680 align:middle line:84%
their way around the
planet, the volume

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
of water that was delivered
is almost unimaginable.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The whole planet is
changing because of this.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.840 align:middle line:10%
Initially inhabitants
of the Mediterranean

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:10%
are more likely to have survived
the flood event than anywhere

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.780 align:middle line:10%
else on the planet almost.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Inhabitants of the
Mediterranean basin

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
had a survival advantage
because they recognized

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:84%
that there were some great
changes to the planet taking

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:10%
That would have
included intense rain.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.740 align:middle line:10%
When the waters
flowed into the basin

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:10%
through the Strait of
Gibraltar, those inhabitants

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:10%
were chased out of the
Mediterranean and up to either

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:10%
the southern coast of Europe or
the northern coast of Africa.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.555 align:middle line:84%
Folks on the Eastern end
of the Mediterranean,

00:15:14.555 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
once that would
eventually flood,

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.812 align:middle line:84%
they may have made their way
to Turkey, Syria, Israel.

00:15:19.812 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the eastern
part of the Mediterranean

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.590 align:middle line:90%
now, those landscapes.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What caused the beginning
of the Younger Dryas?

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:10%
There are a couple of
theories involved here.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:10%
The major theory that
many people talk about

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.510 align:middle line:10%
is that perhaps
the Younger Dryas

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:10%
began with a comet hitting.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
The comet proponents have
suggested all kinds of evidence

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
for this impactor, this
physical impactor either hitting

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
the Earth or exploding
in the atmosphere.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Most of them put it
over North America.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:84%
They suggest that there's
things like the Carolina bays

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:90%
that might be part of the comet.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
They have suggested that
there might have been

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:90%
an impact crater at some point.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
The Hiawatha crater in
Greenland was discovered

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and some people thought
that was the impact crater.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
the Hiawatha crater

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.930 align:middle line:84%
does not date to the beginning
of the Younger Dryas.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's tens of millions
of years older than that.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But when you start putting
together all the evidence,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.540 align:middle line:84%
you have to, in my opinion,
look at other factors as well.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:84%
When the sun has a
major solar outburst,

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that is plasma which is ejected
and if the Earth is in the way,

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.090 align:middle line:90%
hits the Earth.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
We could think of it as
huge lightning bolts.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Some people refer to
them as cosmic rays.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:84%
You have what are known
as solar proton events.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.850 align:middle line:90%
You have coronal mass ejections.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes what's now
referred to as a micro nova.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:84%
This would create the same
type of shock features.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It would create the same
kind of vitrification,

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.810 align:middle line:90%
these glassy little spherules.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
It would set huge
fires and incineration

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the Earth.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When our sun releases
what are called Coronal Mass

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Ejections, CMEs, this is a
tremendous amount of very hot

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.060 align:middle line:84%
plasma that is
leaving the corona,

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:90%
the atmosphere of the sun.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.850 align:middle line:90%
But it's not traveling alone.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not just plasma.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.720 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
a magnetic field

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:90%
that travels with the plasma.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So a massive CME with the plasma
and the magnetic field coming

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
toward the Earth, what
happens is the energy

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
from that plasma pushes the
protons in front of it at such

00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:84%
an accelerated rate that
they begin to move and follow

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
the magnetic field
lines between the planet

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:84%
creating tremendous
amounts of radiation.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, normally our
planetary magnetic field

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:84%
would shield us
from that radiation.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:84%
However, this happens to
be occurring during a time

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
when the magnetic fields
were waning to begin with.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2011, Paul
A. LaViolette, PhD,

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:10%
published a paper providing
evidence from the ocean

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:10%
sediment record in the Curacao
basin of Venezuela that 12,837

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:10%
years before present, an
abrupt rise of radiocarbon

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:10%
concentrations may have been
caused by a massive solar

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:10%
proton event.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.860 align:middle line:84%
LaViolette compares the
findings from Venezuela

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
with data from the same time
period within the Greenland ice

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:84%
record, which reveals
a large acidity

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
spike and high nitrate
ion concentrations,

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that
these are indicators

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.760 align:middle line:90%
of a sudden cosmic ray influx.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Coronal mass ejections were
throwing off balls of plasma.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
In a matter of days as it
raced towards the Earth,

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.290 align:middle line:84%
this bubble of hot
coronal gas and plasma

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.420 align:middle line:84%
would have expanded
to form a dome shaped

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:84%
front tens of millions
of miles in diameter.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Upon arriving, this sphere
of hot, fiery plasma

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
would have temporarily
engulfed the Earth.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
It also would have
severely disturbed

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:90%
the Earth's geomagnetic field.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:10%
>> For the beginning
of the Younger Dryas,

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:10%
we have a cooling period.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:10%
How can the sun having
a major solar outburst

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:10%
cause a cooling period?

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Before the beginning
of the Younger Dryas,

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:90%
the Earth was slowly warming up.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And what you had on the
huge continental ice sheets

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and the glaciers
is you had melting.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And what were being created were
huge lakes on those ice sheets

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that were being held
back at their perimeter

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:90%
by essentially ice dams.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:84%
When this solar outburst hit,
it melted those ice dams.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:84%
It poured huge amounts of fresh
water into the North Atlantic.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
This changed ocean
circulation patterns

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and created an
incredible cooling effect

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:84%
in the northern hemisphere
for 1,200 years.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
One has to realize that the
Younger Dryas cooling period is

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:84%
primarily a northern
hemisphere phenomenon.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden
in my assessment,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:90%
all the pieces fit together.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether we're
talking about the comet,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
whether we're
talking about a CME,

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
all of these events are
now unveiling a new story

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
of our world and a new story of
the conditions that have driven

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
the civilization in our
world in times past.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If there was a watery planet
that exploded in our solar

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:08.360 align:middle line:84%
system and a massive amount of
water and icy debris impacted

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and began flooding the Earth,
what other evidence can be

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:84%
found of the time before
Earth's surface was drastically

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:90%
changed?

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:24.040 align:middle line:84%
>> New technology from
satellites and remote sensing

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.928 align:middle line:84%
now give us the opportunity to
have a vantage point from far

00:21:28.928 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:90%
above the surface of the Earth.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
We're looking from space
on to the landforms that

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
remain today, to the
continents that remain today,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
but we're looking at landforms
from a new perspective

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
through new eyes, through a
new lens of understanding.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the discoveries
that we've made recently

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:84%
is when we begin looking
at the coasts of North

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
America, for example, in
California and the mountains

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and we see the landforms that
appear to be vast drainage

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
areas moving, as
you would expect,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:90%
fluvial channels to move.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
If we continue following
those fluvial channels off

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:07.240 align:middle line:84%
of the coast, what now is
under the water at one time

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.470 align:middle line:90%
was exposed.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:90%
What do we begin to see?

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And what we begin to
see is precisely that.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The continuity, the
continuation of these landforms

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.800 align:middle line:84%
under the water telling us
how much water has covered

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:90%
what was once the land.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You can look at
continental margins.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So if someone wants
to do this, they

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:90%
can go up to the Gulf of Alaska.

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And they can see
a series of rivers

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:84%
that came down from what was
the continental shelf down

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
into the abyss.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And that went hundreds of
miles, 700, 800 miles out.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:84%
One of them winds
its way between two

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:90%
submerged volcanoes.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.827 align:middle line:84%
Over on the East
Coast, you can see

00:22:47.827 --> 00:22:49.660 align:middle line:84%
where those rivers
flowed through the margin

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.030 align:middle line:84%
down into the abyss
prior to the flood.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that we can see
these rivers on both the East

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and West Side of
North America, that

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.248 align:middle line:90%
invalidates continental drift.

00:23:01.248 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:90%
They haven't been moving.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:07.540 align:middle line:84%
These rivers were flowing for
millions of years subaerially

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.012 align:middle line:84%
and they became submerged
during the flood.

00:23:10.012 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
can see them now.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It means the continent
hasn't been moving.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:84%
If there be a smearing, they
wouldn't have the same source.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:84%
You can tell they
have the same mountain

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.760 align:middle line:84%
system, the drainage system
that's still subaerial

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that flowed at one time
down, before the flood,

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.945 align:middle line:90%
flowed down into the abyss.

00:23:25.945 --> 00:23:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at
the satellite imagery,

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
we also see ancient
riverbeds under what is now

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:90%
the Mediterranean Sea.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's further
evidence of ancient river

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.660 align:middle line:84%
systems in the
Celtic Sea just off

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.790 align:middle line:84%
the coast of
Normandy and England.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Here we can see the remains
of these ancient rivers that

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
had the same terminal
depths that we can

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:90%
find in the Monterey Bay area.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.873 align:middle line:84%
So this provides us
some hints of what

00:23:49.873 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
was going on in the ancient
world, what was going on

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
with some of these
ancient civilizations,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:58.310 align:middle line:84%
who these people were,
and what they were doing.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> As satellite imagery and ice
core samples continue to expand

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.450 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of
the ancient planet,

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.110 align:middle line:84%
there is little doubt that the
Earth has drastically changed

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning
of the Younger Dryas.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:84%
What other evidence
points to a time

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:84%
where some of the
people on planet Earth

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.185 align:middle line:84%
were able to survive this
destructive time in history?

00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> At our planet, we have
some societies who went under

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:90%
the Earth.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.280 align:middle line:90%
They constructed tunnels.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:90%
They constructed living rooms.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.510 align:middle line:84%
They constructed
cities under the Earth.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Other constructed
gigantic dolmens,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:90%
dolmens with gigantic roof.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Because from time to time,
stones fell from heaven.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be protected
against these stones who

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.570 align:middle line:90%
fell from heaven.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
That's why they created
subterranean cities in Turkey

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:84%
like Derinkuyu, Kaymakli,
gigantic cities.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Those stones just don't
fell from heaven like this.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:90%
It must be a reason.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It was the destroying
of the asteroid belt.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> What if advanced word got
to Earth that our planet was

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.480 align:middle line:84%
to befall a great
series of calamities,

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:84%
catastrophes that would destroy
civilization as it was known

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:90%
back then?

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:10%
What if this is what we see in
the Cappadocia region of Turkey

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:10%
with places like Derinkuyu
where they built an entire city

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.160 align:middle line:10%
underground to
protect themselves

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.380 align:middle line:10%

from the solar
flares that were just

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:10%
going to decimate the planet?

What if this is what we see
in the Hopi legends of the ant

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.940 align:middle line:84%
people coming up to rescue them
and keep them safe underground

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
until finally the Earth was
safe to repopulate again?

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there was
an advance warning

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.890 align:middle line:84%
that our civilizations on
the planet at that time

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.120 align:middle line:90%
were going to be destroyed.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the people
of Earth were protected.
