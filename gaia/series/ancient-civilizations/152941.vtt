00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> The creator.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Who or what might be the
creator of all that exists?

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Humans have pondered
this question

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning
of time, hoping

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
to understand their own
purpose by looking to the sky.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.510 align:middle line:84%
What if this
explanation is so big?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:84%
What if our universe
is one gigantic cell

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
living in an organism,
a living organism that

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:84%
has many cells, otherwise
known as many universes,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and these many universes
make up a living body.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
If we take, for
instance, the context

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:84%
of the universe compared
to the human cell,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.680 align:middle line:84%
we have a cell made
up of a molecule.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:84%
A molecule consists
of atoms, and an atom

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:84%
consists of electrons that
form around a nucleus.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
This looks similar to our own
understanding of the universe.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.670 align:middle line:84%
There is a famous
quote from the Emerald

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Tablet of Hermes
Trismegistus that

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:90%
states "as above, so below."

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
What if the concept
of the Garden of Eden

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:84%
is just the beginning of
a much bigger picture?

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
What if we are all
part of the Creator,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
from the very first cell to
the universe we see today?

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
If that might be true,
how do the ancient texts

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%
reveal this knowledge?

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:11.006 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the answer to our question
is buried right below our nose.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.562 align:middle line:10%
>> 1945.

00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:10%
It's an intriguing
date, of course,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:10%
because that's the end
of the Second World War.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.290 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into a new era
following the Second World War.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:10%
The Gnostic texts are found
in upper Egypt, almost exactly

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.950 align:middle line:10%
the same time the
Dead Sea Scrolls are

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:10%
found in Israel as well.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Nag Hammadi is a small village
along the Nile River in Egypt.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And a young boy was
tasked by his mother

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.572 align:middle line:84%
to find kindling
which was in very

00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
short supply, because
there are very few trees.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:10%
There's no forests that
grow along the Nile River

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:10%
in that part of Egypt.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.820 align:middle line:10%
Being very resourceful,
he went to what

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:10%
he knew were old
gravesites and old tombs.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:10%
And he found papyrus
books that were bound.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:90%
These are the Gnostic texts.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, it wasn't until
someone recognized,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
a neighbor recognized
what it was

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
that he had that the Department
of Antiquities in Cairo

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:90%
became aware.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.082 align:middle line:84%
And of course they
moved very quickly

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the
remaining documents.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Nag Hammadi Library,
it is the most complete record

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:90%
of the Old Testament.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it's
so controversial

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
is because it contains many
of the books that have not

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.210 align:middle line:84%
been seen since the
Church edited them

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:90%
in the fourth century.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I don't want to
get mystical or spooky,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's as though something is
at work to not allow us to be

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:90%
blinded and silenced.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Something is at work to
allow these ancient ideas

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:90%
to come back into the world.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:10%
And Gnosticism has indeed
come back into the world.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll try to
reconstruct the situation.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
In the early years
of Christianity,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.260 align:middle line:84%
really from sort
of 30 AD onwards,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
through to about 400
AD, there are actually

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.459 align:middle line:84%
many different
kinds of Christians,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
many different sects
that regard themselves

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:84%
as Christians, as
followers of Christ,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
but they had very
different views.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Amongst those early
Christian sects

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.870 align:middle line:84%
were a group that called
themselves Gnostics.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
They believed that there is
a divine spark in humanity.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostic mission was to
liberate that divine spark.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:84%
To provide us with
the saving knowledge

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.390 align:middle line:84%
to lead us to the
revelation that

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.630 align:middle line:84%
would help us to understand
the true nature of things.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Not the illusory
nature that's been

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.400 align:middle line:84%
created to hoodwink all of
us, but the real true nature

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.760 align:middle line:10%
>> What is life for Elon Musk?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Now you can see a video
game that's photorealistic,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.730 align:middle line:10%
almost photorealistic, and
millions of people playing

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:10%
And you see where things are
going with virtual reality.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:10%
If you extrapolate that
out into the future

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:10%
with any rate of progress
at all, then eventually,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.208 align:middle line:10%
those games will be
indistinguishable from reality.

00:05:22.208 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:10%
They'll be so
realistic, you will not

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:10%
be able to tell the
difference between that game

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:10%
and the reality as we know it.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Well, how do we know that that
didn't happen in the past,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.918 align:middle line:10%
and that we're not in one
of those games ourselves?

00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Some believe this concept of
a simulated universe originated

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:10%
from these ancient Gnostic texts
that suddenly were discovered

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.240 align:middle line:10%
in 1945.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:10%
These lost books named the
creator of the universe

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:10%
as an aeon named Sophia.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Sophia was considered
to be a frequency,

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and her frequency would
manifest into certain humans

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.660 align:middle line:90%
and the material realm.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.880 align:middle line:84%
This myth of Sophia
has challenged

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
some to look at the
universe differently

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:90%
than they have before.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The manifestation of Sophia,
the personification of Sophia,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.840 align:middle line:84%
might be representative of
fractal energy and the fact

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that fractal energy fills the
gaps between the symmetries

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:84%
of the very small
and the very large.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:10%
And it's this energy
that we're basically

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:10%
saying is controlling
this ancient technology.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:10%
That all of this
ancient technology

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:10%
is based upon that same idea.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
That it goes on and on through
every single ancient teaching,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
this idea that there is this
all-encompassing, unified

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:90%
energetic field.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.780 align:middle line:84%
It makes a lot of
sense that that

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.570 align:middle line:90%
would be equated to Sophia.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Fractal energy has a
very deep relationship

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:90%
to the golden mean ratio.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And the golden mean ratio
is present in human DNA.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.790 align:middle line:84%
That's what our DNA
is based off of.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's through this
fractal energy and the fact

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:84%
that the golden mean ratio
basically keeps it in check

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and keeps it going in
a certain direction

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to derive a lot
of new technology even today.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It's something that they're
beginning to rediscover,

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
something Nikola Tesla had
come across in his work.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting that
these ancient civilizations

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
were recording information like
this and doing it in such a way

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:84%
that a parable could back up
actual scientific information.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the ancient Gnostic
texts be explaining not only

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:10%
the Creator but the frequency
in which the Creator exists

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.970 align:middle line:10%
through mathematics
and quantum physics?

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> This third dimension is what
we consider to be a holographic

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.300 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not just
me saying this.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:10%
A lot of scientists
have come forward now,

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.842 align:middle line:10%
a lot of scientists involved
in supersymmetry and quantum

00:08:06.842 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:10%
physics, quantum
mechanics, stating

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:10%
that the nature of the
reality of the universe itself

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.092 align:middle line:10%
appears to be
holographic in nature.

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:10%
So what scientists
did was they did

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:10%
an experiment called the
double slit experiment, where

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.840 align:middle line:10%
they put two little,
tiny microscopic slits,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:10%
and they put
photons on the back.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.450 align:middle line:10%
And they shot these photons
through these slits.

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:10%
But when they weren't
looking, the photon

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.780 align:middle line:10%
created a wave pattern on the
back wall of this experiment.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:10%
So they said, why?

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:10%
How can this be?

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.221 align:middle line:10%
How can individual photons
create a wave pattern?

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:10%
So they went back and put
a looking device, a camera,

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.017 align:middle line:10%
to see how the photons were
going through these slits

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:10%
to create a wave pattern.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to know
how that could be.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.679 align:middle line:10%
But when they did
that, when they looked,

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:10%
it created a digital
pattern on the back wall.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:10%
So all of a sudden, they--

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:10%
it was a wild moment.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.720 align:middle line:10%
The actual prospect of
looking, in other words,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:10%
conscious intervention,
can change matter,

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:10%
can change the shape
of the universe.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it tells us
that consciousness is really

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
what-- is all that
exists in the universe.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
pure consciousness.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And what consciousness
has actually done,

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
it has actually
recreated itself,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
or it actually split
itself into pieces,

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
to experience
itself subjectively.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness wants to go
out, and it wants to create.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And what it has done, it has
gone out with these energies,

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and it has created subjectively
humans, planets, galaxies,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
so that it can experience
itself from another perspective.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we take from
it from the quantum level,

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.192 align:middle line:84%
in terms of these
Sophia energies

00:09:36.192 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
Gnostic energies.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.817 align:middle line:84%
It appears that consciousness
is the only thing that

00:09:39.817 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:84%
really exists, and everything
else seems to be an illusion.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.620 align:middle line:10%
Nassim Haramein has been doing
some really interesting work

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:10%
which does tie in very much to
the old view of the ancients

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:10%
and the Gnostics
in that it explains

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.605 align:middle line:10%
how creation transpires.

00:09:54.605 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:10%
What he is talking
about, in more

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:10%
of a metaphysics
or quantum level,

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.330 align:middle line:10%
is how existence comes to be.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's cosmogony.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's how the
cosmos comes to form.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Which to the Gnostics was the
flow of reality from eternity

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:90%
into nature and back.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
This flow is
actually represented

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:90%
by the Goddess Sophia.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.940 align:middle line:84%
She is the flow
of reality itself,

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.735 align:middle line:84%
coming out from the
preexisting state of spirit.

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But if this is true, why
would this understanding

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and an aeon
named Sophia be hidden beneath

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.520 align:middle line:90%
the sand for so long?

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> There's that movie,
"The Usual Suspects."

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:10%
There's a line in the movie--

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The greatest trick the devil
ever pulled was convincing

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:10%
the world he didn't exist.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Gnostics took it
one step further.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.510 align:middle line:84%
The greatest trick
the devil ever played

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
was to convince the
world that he is God.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:84%
In other words, from
the Gnostic point

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.270 align:middle line:84%
of view, what we have been
worshiping for thousands

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%
of years isn't God at all.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a demonic force.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:10.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sumerian texts allude
to the same principle,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that a great administrator named
Sat-an looked over the people

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:90%
of the Garden of Eden.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:84%
His name in the Sumerian
text was the God Enlil.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And his hopes were to
enslave the human race.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
He then appears in the Garden
as Yahweh, the biblical god.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:84%
The serpent in the
garden, however,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:84%
was another Sumerian
god named Enki,

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
whose desire was to free the
human race through knowledge.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:10%
How did this concept
of good and evil

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.830 align:middle line:10%
get so flipped upside down?

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2003, we discovered a
degeneration in the brain that

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.250 align:middle line:10%
seem to be programmed to
a molecule called PP1.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:90%
We cannot explain why.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain point, humans
have this incredible ability

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:90%
to forget.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
This molecule affects
the brain, and it

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.510 align:middle line:90%
is a degeneration of memory.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is a
programmed blockage which was

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.030 align:middle line:90%
performed on the human brain.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:84%
What is interesting
about great myths,

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it is for Native
Americans or for Africans,

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:84%
very much as well, is
that they have the ability

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:84%
to constantly recite those
myths, their history,

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:90%
so as not to forget.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people, the
Hebrews as well,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:84%
probably, have managed
to have this ability

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
to pass on information
across generations.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Could there really be a
molecule that blocks our true

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:90%
remembering of who we are?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Was this a programmed
manipulation

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:90%
of our genetic code?

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
This might explain
our constant search

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:84%
for where we as humans
originated from and who

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.645 align:middle line:90%
or what might be God.

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The Garden of
Eden, to the Gnostics,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
refers to the center principle
from which all creation

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:90%
springs.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's the preexisting
spirit of God, so to speak.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.585 align:middle line:84%
So this is before
time and space.

00:13:10.585 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's the circle whose
center is everywhere

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and whose circumference
is nowhere.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:10%
So everything that
exists in this world

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:10%
preexists within
what the Gnostics

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.276 align:middle line:10%
refer to as the Pleroma,
which means fullness.

00:13:24.276 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to imagine where
the Pleroma could be located

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:90%
with our current point of view.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Some say that it is
linked to dimensions.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think that inherently,
the idea of Pleroma

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
is more linked to frequency,
another frequency.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> If we go back to our
understanding of quantum

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
physics and the
creation of matter,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:84%
could this frequency transcend
into our physical universe

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:90%
today?

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:10%
And how do the Gnostic
texts explain this?

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a preexistent
tension within--

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
in the Pleroma where
the archetypal deities

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:84%
or archangels almost
demand their expression

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
or substantiation within the
playing fields of creation

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Because they preexist
in this state of light

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
that they almost need
to express their--

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:84%
these ideal forms
that they represent.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:84%
So what Sophia the
myth kind of represents

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:84%
is the urge for them
to create themselves.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The goddess Sophia, the aeon,
Sophia, whose name, of course,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:90%
means wisdom.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And she enters a
trance-like dream state.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And in that dream state,
she envisages a singularity,

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.820 align:middle line:90%
the Anthropos, humanity.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So she exits the Pleroma
and then falls into a state

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.390 align:middle line:90%
of deficiency.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And in that state of
deficiency, she splits.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's a higher
version of Sophia

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
that remains in the
Pleroma, which is kind

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:90%
of like her celestial twin.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And then a lower Sophia
exits and becomes

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
the physical
universe, the cosmic,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.570 align:middle line:84%
the soul of the world,
which is deficient,

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:84%
because now evil is
introduced into that,

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:90%
or a deficiency or a corruption.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:84%
>> As a result of
that fall tearing,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
tearing through the layers
and levels of reality,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
is created the entity that the
Gnostics call the Demiurge,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and he is also the creator
of the physical Earth

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and of the beings
who dwell upon it.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.770 align:middle line:84%
It is Sophia's
work that inserted

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
into the heart of
humanity, deep within us,

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:90%
is this divine spark.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
That we are fundamentally
creatures of spirit

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:90%
immersed in matter.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If Sophia is the creator
of our divine spark,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
then could the Demiurge be the
creator of the matter we exist

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:90%
in?

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Is he the architect
of our reality?

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The Demiurge becomes
a representation

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:15.390 align:middle line:90%
of Sophia's irrational passions.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:10%
So Sophia's irrational
passions takes

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:10%
on the form of the
Demiurge, which also becomes

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.500 align:middle line:10%
the rulers of the Archons.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Graham Hancock,
the Demiurge is what humans

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.660 align:middle line:84%
might refer to as the Biblical
god or creator of the universe.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And this creator created
himself, angels, or demons,

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:90%
depending on how you look at it.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And these Archons help
keep order in the universe.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The Goddess Sophia is
incarnated in the Earth itself,

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:84%
but the Earth is the
domain of the Demiurge.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And the project of the Demiurge
is to get rid of that divine

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
spark in humanity,
to snuff it out.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
To stamp it out forever,
so that we become entirely

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.270 align:middle line:90%
his creatures.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The Archons, which were
created by the Demiurge,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.020 align:middle line:84%
according to the Gnostic text,
stand between the human race

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:90%
and the great architect himself.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:10%
In most cases,
they are considered

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:10%
to be semi-hostile
angels and demons.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:10%
>> The Demiurge's motives
were not that good,

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:10%
according to the Gnostics.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:10%
And then the Demiurge put
and created these Archons

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:10%
to be in charge of making
sure that the universe stays

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.140 align:middle line:10%
intact as a prison for souls.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.070 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Every generation
is a step lower,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:10%
further from the
perfect monad holiness.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:10%
And they created
worlds of their own.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, they were only one
step above pure evil.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:51.250 align:middle line:90%
So these were corrupted worlds.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.010 align:middle line:10%
>> In the Gnostic text,
specifically the Apocryphon

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:10%
of John, it gives a detailed
account of the various Archons.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.068 align:middle line:84%
In this chapter, it
suggests there are seven.

00:18:02.068 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> These actually correspond
very nicely with the seven

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:90%
planets.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And the actual name of the
planets in our tradition

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
have very different names
when they are called Archons

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:90%
in the Gnostic tradition.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Saturn, in the
Gnostic tradition,

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:90%
is called Yaldabaoth or Samael.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter is called Iao.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Mars is called Sabaoth.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:90%
Venus is called Astaphanos.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.750 align:middle line:90%
The sun is called Adonaios.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Mercury is called Elaios.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And the moon is called Horaios.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:84%
We now have an astrology
where the planets appear

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to have influences
on the personality,

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and they vary from
one to another.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We have this opportunity
to understand there

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:90%
was a ghost in the machine.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Something is going on that takes
the apparent mundane reality

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.882 align:middle line:84%
on the surface,
veneer level, and you

00:18:51.882 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
look past the veneer
level, and you

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.650 align:middle line:84%
see there is an
organized plan in place.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the ghost in the
system be the energy of Sophia

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
reincarnating herself
into goddess archetypes?

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:10%
And could these concepts of
the Demiurge and the Archons

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.610 align:middle line:10%
coincide with some of the
motivations of the characters

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.645 align:middle line:10%
in the Sumerian text?

00:19:12.645 --> 00:19:17.184 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.184 --> 00:19:20.330 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] >>
This world is completely offset

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.640 align:middle line:10%
compared to our way of thinking.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
It really seems like
science fiction.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.438 align:middle line:84%
When we watch science
fiction movies nowadays,

00:19:28.438 --> 00:19:30.605 align:middle line:84%
we can find that the same
themes are being explored.

00:19:30.605 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian Gnostic
texts, we find

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.230 align:middle line:90%
a recurrent main character.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.900 align:middle line:90%
She is called Sophia.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.810 align:middle line:10%
And this Sophia will
become Tiamat, Tiamata,

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:10%
from the Sumerian text.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:51.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:56.040 align:middle line:10%
Tiamata can be decomposed
in ti, ama, and ta.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:10%
The latter is not always added.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:84%
In very concrete terms,
it means the Lady of Life.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Ama is lady, and ti is life.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting to see
that right off, we get

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:90%
that she is a supreme goddess.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Then we can actually find
her in different mythologies.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Tiamat is the archetype
of the mother goddess,

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:10%
and as Sophia's spokesperson,
is all powerful.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:10%
And according to
the Sumerian texts,

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:10%
she is going to create
herself a lineage of females

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.640 align:middle line:10%
that we call Amashatum.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:10%
This could be translated
to the lizard mothers.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.865 align:middle line:84%
In the Sumerian
text, I think it's

00:20:39.865 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
important to note
that the Sophia

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.310 align:middle line:84%
energy is going to create
a new being, named An.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.830 align:middle line:10%
You should know that the An
particle also means the sky.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:10%
That character is then
going to create a people

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.297 align:middle line:10%
we find in Sumerian text.

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
It is important to
note that gods were

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:90%
created in artificial matrices.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
An creates Enki, and
then Enki creates

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
another son, who becomes An's
spokesperson for his agenda.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:90%
His name is Enlil.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And Enlil will ceaselessly
be against Enki,

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
in order to impede
him and his knowledge

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:90%
from getting out to the humans.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
As soon as An steps in,
things are going to change.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:84%
We can see that An
wants to overthrow

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:84%
the matriarchal royalty
and enforce his own rule.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:84%
This marks an
important separation

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.410 align:middle line:84%
in the history of
the Sumerian gods

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:90%
and of the gods in general.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:10%
On the one hand, there is the
matriarchal energy with Tiamat,

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:10%
with Sophia's energy.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:10%
And on the other
hand, these new gods,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:10%
fresh out of the
matrices, male gods,

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.930 align:middle line:10%
who are going to
revolt against Tiamat.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:84%
We see Enlil going to fight
Tiamat, enforcing his power.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we find
in the "Enuma Elish."

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sumerian texts suggest
that Tiamata was defeated

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
by Enlil, and he takes over as
ruler to instill the principles

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.210 align:middle line:90%
of the false god.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:10%
In the Gnostic text,
however, it suggests

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:10%
that the Sophia energy
that embodied Tiamata

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:10%
was not defeated,
but rather ignored.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And the knowledge
of her existence

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:84%
was taken over by the
knowledge of the Demiurge.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:10%
The Gnostic texts
explain to us that we

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:10%
have been under the influence
of this great Archon who

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:10%
is not the true creator
he fashions himself to be.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And because of this,
we suffered greatly

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:90%
under our own false reality.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But the Sumerian texts remind
us that throughout this battle

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, there's given to
us an ally by the name of Enki

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.920 align:middle line:84%
who fights to keep the
Sophia frequency alive.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It is important to know that
the so-called Gnostic texts,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the ones from Nag Hammadi,
were all excavated in Egypt.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.040 align:middle line:84%
That is crucial information,
because the character of Enki

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.650 align:middle line:84%
lived for a while in
ancient Mesopotamia,

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:84%
but after a while was
in such disagreement

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
with Enlil, that
he left for Egypt.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:90%
He attempted civilizing mankind.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:84%
He is then found under
the name of Osiris.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
These archives, probably
created by Enki,

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.350 align:middle line:84%
usually depict events that
took place prior to the ones

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:90%
that we find in Sumerian texts.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:84%
They are about the creation
before creation itself.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a return of
the Sophia to the logos,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:90%
or the godhead.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:10%
And when that return
happens, it is

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.370 align:middle line:10%
described as being this
incredible burst of light that

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:47.510 align:middle line:10%
actually changes the very
fabric of the bodies themselves.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
This to me sounds
like another example

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.260 align:middle line:84%
of the widespread
prophecies that we

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
see of this energy
released from the sun.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Greek and Roman
philosophers often

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.125 align:middle line:84%
called the ekpyrosis, a massive
fire release from the sun.

00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking
at this story of Sophia

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and her redemption,
it seems that it

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.600 align:middle line:84%
is another example of
the prophecies that

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
go all the way back to the
Greek texts, the Hindu texts,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
in which we go through some
sort of massive transformation

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:84%
in this sort of fallen state
of our solar system or humanity

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and then brought
back up to a higher

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:90%
spiritual level in some way.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the Gnostic texts be
supporting the meaning behind

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:10%
the Sumerian creation story?

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:10%
If the Gnostic texts are able to
explain our possible beginning

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.120 align:middle line:10%
as humans and our current
state of simulated reality,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.180 align:middle line:10%
why do we still feel
lost in the system?

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:10%
And will all this
understanding of who we are

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.210 align:middle line:10%
and why we are here return?

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of the fallen
Sophia does appear to mirror

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
the story of each of us in terms
of how we have become blinded

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:90%
to the afterlife.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:84%
We became blinded to
higher consciousness.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't really understand
if we are going to live again

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:84%
or if we have lived
before, and we

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.550 align:middle line:84%
don't understand if there is a
purpose or plan for our lives

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.730 align:middle line:90%
and for the greater universe.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It's hidden.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:03.738 align:middle line:90%
You can't really perceive it.

00:25:03.738 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't become
substantiated yet.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming substantiated
through this life process

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.898 align:middle line:90%
that we're living.

00:25:12.898 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of
like I like to think

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:84%
that we live in the
greatest story ever told.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Like all these myths are--

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:90%
we're living it, right?

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a living mythology.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a
collective universe.

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.157 align:middle line:90%
It's all integrated.

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's nothing--
the only thing

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that separates us
from each other

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and from nature and
from the divine is

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:90%
our own misguided perception.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Our misguided perception
may have been the work

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient gods, but there
is more evidence to support

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.780 align:middle line:84%
that the original creators of
the Garden of Eden might have

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.971 align:middle line:90%
planted a seed on Earth.

00:25:46.971 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's as though something
slipped past the redactors

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.610 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of truth came
through instead of all the lies

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:90%
that the Demiurge has spread.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next, the Tree of Life
and its imprint on the world.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.010 align:middle line:90%
