00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2014, Dr. Neil Ross
and a team of scientists from

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:10%
the University of Bristol's
Glaciology Centre published

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:10%
their discovery of a valley
the size of the Grand Canyon

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:10%
in west Antarctica.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Despite being covered beneath
several kilometers of ice,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.040 align:middle line:84%
the depression was so vast that
it could be seen from space.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:10%
Some theorists were quick to
conclude that before the Great

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:10%
Ice Age, Antarctica, like
the six other continents,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:10%
was likely to have been home
to ancient civilizations.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ross eloquently summarized
that the implications

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
of his research served merely
to demonstrate how much we still

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
have to discover
about our planet.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But could it be possible
that there are ruins, perhaps

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
ruins even older
than Gobekli Tepe,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
to be discovered deep
beneath the glaciers?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the consequences of
global warming is that the ice

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:10%
on the poles has
receded tremendously,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:10%
including Antarctica.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And the-- the thickness of
the ice, as it is reduced,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:84%
allows greater visibility
from earth penetrating radar.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So we can see what's
underneath the ice.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the surprises is
that the satellite images

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:84%
are sending back now
what appear to be

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.058 align:middle line:84%
large-scale complex
archaeological sites.

00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:84%
So they're-- they're not
small hunting villages and pit

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:90%
houses.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:10%
These look like advanced
technological civilizations

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:10%
that we're seeing
underneath the ice.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.570 align:middle line:10%
One of the reasons this is
a problem for historians

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:10%
is because the ice sheet an--

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.583 align:middle line:10%
in Antarctica originated
most recently--

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:22.250 align:middle line:10%
we've had multiple
ice sheets-- the most

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.977 align:middle line:10%
recent about 20,000 years ago.

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And that opens the door
to the question, who

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
was here 20,000
years ago to build

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
complex archaeological
structures

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.250 align:middle line:90%
on the continent of Antarctica?

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And what role does that
play in the history

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and the mythology
that's almost universal

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:90%
of ancient civilizations?

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It may be what we now see is
the six cradles of civilization

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
very soon will expand to at
least seven and possibly more.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You get reports occasionally
of structures being found

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.020 align:middle line:84%
emerging out of the
ice in Antarctica.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:10%
Just recently, there was
one which took my attention

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:10%
to do with what was described
as almost like an embanked area,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:10%
like a hill fort,
that was found.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And that struck my attention
as being different to all

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:90%
the other stories.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And this raises my hopes that
these settlements did actually

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I think this matter should
be looked into more.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is, can
we interest archaeologists

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
to spend good money to go
to Antarctica to investigate

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:90%
these sites?

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I think it's possible
that as the ice starts

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
to melt in Antarctica, which
it is doing more and more,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:90%
that it will reveal structures.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And if this is the
case, those structures

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
have probably been buried in
the ice for tens of thousands

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So these are going to be
very, very ancient, indeed.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And they could easily be the
product of hybrid descendants.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:84%
>> But who could
these descendants be?

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Researchers like
Billy Carson lead us

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
to some new theories
on Antarctica

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:90%
and its current location.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Antarctica had once
been a tropical island,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.907 align:middle line:84%
and that was the center of
the so-called pre-Adamite

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.103 align:middle line:10%
And it got moved to
what's now the south pole.

00:04:33.103 --> 00:04:35.020 align:middle line:10%
There might have been
some kind of nuclear war

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:10%
that took place on Earth.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:90%
That's entirely possible.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.890 align:middle line:84%
Or there could have been some
energetic release from the sun.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.560 align:middle line:84%
The resulting effect appears
to be that the Atlantean flood

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:90%
becomes the Atlantean glacier.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And because it's now
in a new position

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:84%
where the water freezes,
it turns into Antarctica.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> If structures from a
pre-Adamite culture might exist

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:84%
below the ice, who are these
beings that did not survive

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:90%
a cataclysm?

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Or did they?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't remember
where we came from.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't remember that
we were essentially

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
a seeded, genetically
created race to be

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:90%
able to inherit the Earth.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is the descendants

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
of the pre-Adamites, the people
who were here before the Flood,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
the people who
actually messed up.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, the
Elohim voluntarily

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
let this flood happen
to largely wipe out

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.340 align:middle line:90%
the pre-Adamites on Earth.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So these pre-Adamites, some of
them, apparently still exist.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
They still have
elongated skulls,

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.405 align:middle line:84%
and they still believe
that they are the gods

00:05:30.405 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and that we are essentially
an invading civilization.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And then this new
group gets sent in,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:84%
the Adam or the modern
human form that we all are,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:84%
with new DNA,
genetically modified,

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
tinkered, and sent
down here, intended

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
for the spiritual expression
of humans to come out.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And these pre-Adamite beings
became very upset about this.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:84%
After a great cataclysm that
occurred about 12,800 years

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:84%
ago, the survivors of
this pre-Adamite group

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.185 align:middle line:84%
were spread out all
across the Earth.

00:05:58.185 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And they had no way to
communicate with each other.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So the survivors of this
group, which were not

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.110 align:middle line:84%
pre-Adamite bloodlines, they
had been mixed and spliced

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:90%
with local humans.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And they became a totally
different species.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it really be true
that there was once an unknown

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:84%
civilization of ancient
beings in Antarctica?

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:84%
In 1929, a map was discovered
inside Istanbul's Topkapi

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Palace, depicting Antarctica
before it was covered with ice.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists have been able to
carbon-date the map's creation

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
back to a Turkish admiral
and cartographer named Piri

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Reis, who plotted it in 1513.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:10%
This age was hundreds of
years before the continent

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:10%
was discovered by modern man.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:10%
Reis's map has both conventional
and alternative scholars

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.900 align:middle line:10%
flummoxed.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Where did he gather
his knowledge?

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
If the landmass depicted
is indeed Antarctica,

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that our
true origins date back

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
to a prehistoric
seafaring civilization?

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
While mainstream scientists
are resistant to get

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
behind these findings,
no other explanation

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:84%
for the mysteries this map
presents have been offered.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
But with global warming
exposing new topography

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:84%
under the glaciers,
harder evidence

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.680 align:middle line:90%
may be just around the corner.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We are about to hear
from official sources that

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.110 align:middle line:84%
architecture has been located
in Antarctica that will confirm

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:84%
there was, in fact,
intelligently built ruins down

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And that would be a world
changing thing of significance.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
This Atlantean legend
has an incredible amount

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.073 align:middle line:90%
of provable data behind it.

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we do get the disclosure
that we're being promised,

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:84%
this is going to become an
open, public, acknowledged thing

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:84%
that there are, in
fact, stone monuments

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:84%
under the ice in Antarctica
that are very ancient.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
If that happens,
everything that we

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:84%
thought we knew about human
history has to be rewritten.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And we are now dealing with
an ancient civilization

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.680 align:middle line:84%
far predating those which we
now acknowledge to be true.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Most academics believe that
all Native American people,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.710 align:middle line:10%
no matter where you find them,
that all of their ancestors

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:10%
came across the Bering land
bridge and that they all only

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:10%
had four genotypes,
A, B, C, and D.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who's a pure-blooded
Indian or native person

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.705 align:middle line:84%
in the Americas, their whole
haplo group or genetics are A,

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:90%
B, C, or D.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But we've tested
three of these so far,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and they are not A, B, C,
or D. They show ancestry

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.340 align:middle line:84%
either from Europe
or the Middle East

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
or the Middle East people
who moved to Europe.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:84%
So that completely
blows the theory

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.950 align:middle line:84%
that there was only one
way to get to the Americas

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.690 align:middle line:90%
in pre-Columbian times.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.790 align:middle line:84%
It means that people
were sailing the oceans

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.240 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And they knew where
they were going.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
capability of navigation

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.410 align:middle line:84%
to be able to circumnavigate the
planet long before the Vikings.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught
so little in school

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:90%
about the history of humanity.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And academics have a tendency
to not talk to Indigenous people

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.668 align:middle line:90%
about their own history.

00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:84%
They think they made their
stories up about where

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
their ancestors came from.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:10%
>> These beings are not of a--

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:10%
a human or a Neanderthal
or Cro-Magnon DNA at all,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.650 align:middle line:10%
that it's actually an
entirely different being.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
jury's still out,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
as far as when exactly these
beings came, what exactly they

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:84%
are, if they did evolve on
Earth and were some sort of lost

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.980 align:middle line:84%
tribe of the human species, or
if they really are indication

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
of the Anunnaki gods, the ones
who came from the sky to Earth.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:54.520 align:middle line:10%
And again, it-- it plays
into this overall mythology

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:10%
of the fall to Mount
Hermon of the 300 watchers,

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.510 align:middle line:10%
whether that's in the Bible or
the Anunnaki tradition of Enki,

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:10%
Enlil, and their families
coming and creating humans

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:10%
by mixing their DNA with ours.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps these
elongated skulls are

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.590 align:middle line:10%
evidence of those gods
of the ancient world who

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:10%
lived for apparently
thousands of years.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>> As glaciers crack
with alarming regularity,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Antarctica continues
to make headlines.

Billy Carson exposes why
politicians and astronauts

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
like Buzz Aldrin have
been visiting recently.

According to his sources,

on what is emerging
under the ice

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.163 align:middle line:10%
has reached a critical stage.

00:10:40.163 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to understand that
there is a very significant

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
difference between how
the scholarship on ancient

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.655 align:middle line:84%
civilizations is seen in the
open, unclassified world,

00:10:47.655 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to how it's
being seen within the secret

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.545 align:middle line:84%
government and the
military-industrial complex.

00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:53.920 align:middle line:10%
They are going
back, and they are

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.063 align:middle line:10%
looking at every single
mythology they can find.

00:10:56.063 --> 00:10:57.730 align:middle line:10%
And they are asking
questions which need

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.933 align:middle line:10%
to have scientific answers.

00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:10%
They have started to
learn that no matter what

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:10%
the ancient mythology is,
if you dig deep enough,

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.590 align:middle line:10%
you're going to find
out, wait a minute,

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:10%
there's something here that
suggests this is not a myth.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a story about
beings that, at one time,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.590 align:middle line:84%
were contacting people on
Earth on a widespread basis.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They are very aware that
extraterrestrial civilizations

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.292 align:middle line:84%
have been visiting Earth
since primordial antiquity.

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Very quickly, we're going
to be dealing with the idea

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.833 align:middle line:84%
that extraterrestrials
were immigrating here.

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the
reason why we're not

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:84%
finding the trail of pottery
shards and all the things

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that archaeologists want
to see that build up

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:84%
into a technological
civilization, the reason is

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.600 align:middle line:84%
is because they didn't become
technological on Earth.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.787 align:middle line:84%
They were already technological
when they got here.

00:11:39.787 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And they were simply
doing what they already

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:84%
knew, which is being
able to levitate

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
massive blocks of stone and put
them together like tinker toys

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and build these gorgeous
pyramids all over the planet.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was a civilization
that covered the entire planet.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The main city was in
Antarctica, and it's now

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:90%
under miles of ice.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.430 align:middle line:84%
All of their embassies, if
you want to call them that,

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:84%
were spread out across
the entire Earth

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.568 align:middle line:90%
and were also destroyed.

00:12:13.568 --> 00:12:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are remnants
of what we're now finding

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.985 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the ocean.

00:12:16.985 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2011, geochemist Stacy
Lowry found evidence that

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:84%
America and Antarctica
were once joined,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:84%
before a billion years of
continental drift sent them

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:90%
in different directions.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Since then, more geologists
have come forward

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:84%
with tests showing
that the composition

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:84%
of magnetic isotopes in
rocks taken from Antarctica's

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.330 align:middle line:84%
coastland were
indistinguishable from samples

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:84%
of rocks in a rift that
runs through the Great

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Lakes of Michigan.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
The two rock samples are
reportedly the exact same age

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and have identical
chemical properties.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
If Antarctica was once
connected to the Americas,

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
then is it also possible that
the same pre-Adamite species

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
once populated both more
than 55,000 years ago?

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.863 align:middle line:84%
Brien Foerster brings us back
to the DNA of ancient humans

00:13:10.863 --> 00:13:11.905 align:middle line:90%
and what it might reveal.

00:13:11.905 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.190 align:middle line:10%
>> The ancestry of these
people could be incredibly

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:10%
complicated.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:10%
Initial DNA results
indicated that at least part

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:10%
of their bloodline is not
Native American whatsoever.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're-- we're looking at
the possibility that part

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:84%
of their ancestry is
from the Middle East,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
which means they did not
cross the Bering land bridge,

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
like all other Native Americans'
ancestors supposedly did.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.885 align:middle line:84%
And that would be a major
historical discovery.

00:13:43.885 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying
these-- these people

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:90%
for about eight to 10 years.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:84%
It seems that only the
nobility of the Paracas

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
culture of the coast of
Peru had elongated skulls.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And the preservation in
that area is almost perfect.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:84%
So we do have examples
of the skulls with hair,

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.470 align:middle line:90%
and the hair is always red.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's genetic red.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not the result of bleaching
or the sun or something

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And so red hair originates
in the Middle East, in Iraq.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Iran, and Afghanistan.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So if they had red
hair, they likely

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:23.280 align:middle line:84%
had light-colored skin, as well
possibly as green or blue eyes.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
All three of those
characteristics

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:84%
are not typical of
Native American people.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So that could very well indicate
that those ancestors sailed

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:84%
from the Middle East
to the coast of Peru.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1928, in a desert on the
Paracas peninsula on the south

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:10%
coast of Peru, archaeologist
Julio Tello unearthed

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:10%
a graveyard filled with
the remains of corpses with

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:10%
the largest elongated skulls
found anywhere in the world.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Some were dated back
as far as 3,000 years.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.740 align:middle line:84%
This discovery shocked
scientific communities

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:84%
because it challenged
what had been recorded

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:90%
in Peruvian and human history.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Tello's discovery
has since become

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:90%
known as the "Paracas skulls."

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.670 align:middle line:10%
And even more
astoundingly, since 1928,

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.040 align:middle line:10%
other elongated skulls
have been found.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The oldest elongated
skulls in the world have been

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
discovered in Iraq
in one specific cave.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And the initial DNA testing
that we've been able to do

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.640 align:middle line:84%
indicates that these people
had haplo groups which

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:84%
are either from northern
Europe or from the Middle East.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
What exactly they
are will require

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:90%
rigorous scientific examination.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:84%
We were able to do DNA
testing of a baby that

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.490 align:middle line:84%
died at 18 months and had
strawberry blonde hair, which

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.530 align:middle line:90%
is not Native American.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And the analysis that
was done indicated

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.220 align:middle line:84%
that it had segments of
DNA that do not match

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:90%
anything known to be human.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that all
ancestors of Native Americans,

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
all of their
ancestors are believed

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:84%
to have crossed the Bering
land bridge from south

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:90%
or from eastern Asia.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So nobody from the Middle
East or from Europe

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
would walk across
all of Asia in order

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.120 align:middle line:90%
to cross into North America.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.437 align:middle line:84%
These ancient people
had seafaring skills.

00:16:23.437 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to
build boats, and they

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:84%
knew how to sail
thousands of years

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:84%
before the Vikings or
Columbus or anyone like that.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite likely
that they migrated by sea

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.345 align:middle line:84%
through the Indian Ocean
and then across the Pacific.

00:16:36.345 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Skeptics have long dismissed
the validity of the remains

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
found with elongated skulls
as being scientific proof

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.250 align:middle line:90%
of pre-Adamites.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:84%
They claim that these
skulls are artificial,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:84%
an objection made even more
complicated by the fact

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that there have been
tribes who practiced

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.332 align:middle line:90%
cranial deformation on infants.

00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to the
discovery of elongated heads,

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the mainstream
scientists might shrug it off

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, this is
an indication of binding.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:84%
They believe that humans
bound their skulls

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:84%
to make themselves
look like they

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
had these massive heads, which
doesn't quite make sense,

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
unless you actually
did have some kind

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:90%
of gods who had those heads.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:10%
And you were trying to
imitate those heads.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Cranial deformation is
where a newborn child's head is

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:84%
bound, usually with something
like leather or possibly wood

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
on the front and back, wrapped
with some kind of textile.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
So by three years
old, the child's skull

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:90%
is completely bone.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And then therefore,
throughout their life,

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:90%
they maintain that design.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It was done in order
to differentiate

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
physically the nobility
from the common class.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But you can distinguish
between cranial deformation

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.580 align:middle line:90%
and what I'm talking about.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
You see the obvious flattening
of the front and back

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of the skull with
cranial deformation.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I've studied this subject
about elongated skulls

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.230 align:middle line:90%
for about eight years.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, they did exist
on all six inhabited continents.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But almost all of
them are the example

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
of cranial deformation,
which is changing

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:90%
the shape of the skull.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:10%
However, in the
case of the Paracas,

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:10%
we have the largest
elongated skulls

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.580 align:middle line:10%
ever found on the planet.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:10%
And that makes the Paracas
culture very specifically

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:10%
interesting.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.350 align:middle line:84%
We've even found baby skeletons
where the skull is elongated.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:44.270 align:middle line:84%
There was one recently I saw
of a probably three-month-old.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And its head was twice
the size of normal.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just that
the shape is different.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.380 align:middle line:90%
The volume is different.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And many medical experts
have looked at these.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And they've said, you can change
the shape of a baby's head,

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
soft to begin with.

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But you can't
increase the volume.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.710 align:middle line:10%
So that by itself
is telling us we're

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:10%
looking at a-- a
genetic variation.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Billy Carson explores who
these royal families were

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.050 align:middle line:10%
and where they're from.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at these
pre-Adamite records of what

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
these ancient texts
are telling us,

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:84%
it maps together very nicely
with the actual archaeological

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:84%
ruins that we find
around the world.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
What gets even more interesting
is when we get into the idea

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
of the post-Atlantean
catastrophe world,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.630 align:middle line:84%
meaning post-12,500 years
ago, two pre-Adamite groups

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:84%
survived, one group in
Europe and one in Asia,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
which becomes the
Egyptian pharonic line,

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and the other group
in Mesoamerica,

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.657 align:middle line:84%
which becomes the
Mesoamerican priesthood.

00:19:41.657 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:10%
They apparently did not have
any contact with each other

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:10%
until the time of the
conquistadors, roughly about

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:10%
the 1500s or 1600s.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.077 align:middle line:10%
According to what we see
in these ancient texts,

00:19:51.077 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:10%
these two groups
represent what people

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.850 align:middle line:10%
are calling the Illuminati,
what people are calling

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.340 align:middle line:10%
the New World Order, and the
basis for the whole system

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:10%
of the divine right of
kings and royal blood.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.077 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.077 --> 00:20:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It appears that these
elongated-skull beings

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:84%
are drawn to places
of power, where

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.227 align:middle line:90%
they can assert their control.

00:20:07.227 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
After the time of
Columbus, this group

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
finally was able to communicate
with each other again.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to control religion.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.710 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to control finances.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of the information
I came across

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.692 align:middle line:84%
was that these people
are still alive today

00:20:19.692 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and that they have
elongated skulls

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and will hide them in public
with either wraps or miter

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.335 align:middle line:84%
hats, like you see
in the Vatican.

00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
There are royal
burials that have

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
been found from more
recent times in France

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and openly acknowledged where
the royalty, with their jewels

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and riches, were
buried that way.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:10%
And they had elongated skulls.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.060 align:middle line:10%
We furthermore have a
very interesting story,

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:10%
which is that one of the royal
bloodlines in Italy, where

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:10%
the Vatican and the
Roman Empire are located,

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.140 align:middle line:10%
that one of the royal bloodlines
was called the d'Este family.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have Prince Leonello
d'Este and his princess.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.450 align:middle line:84%
They both have
ridiculously elongated

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.790 align:middle line:90%
skulls in every illustration.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is as recent as
the 14th century in Italy.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.680 align:middle line:10%
The actual bloodline
of the d'Este family

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.830 align:middle line:10%
matriculates into almost
the entire European royalty.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:10%
It goes all over the place--

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:10%
Germany, France,
Belgium, Britain.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:10%
It is unknown how
many of these people

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:10%
are still alive on Earth that
have the elongated skulls.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I've heard a number, about
15,000, thrown around.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
There are those
that have suggested

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:84%
there might be more than that,
but we don't really know.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
According to recent
eyewitnesses,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:84%
they have seen people
with elongated skulls

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
in places like London, in the
financial district in New York,

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:90%
and in the Vatican.

>> Is it possible that these
ancient elites with elongated

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
skulls are controlling our
political and religious

organizations?

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And if so, could this
be a way of safeguarding

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.700 align:middle line:84%
some great secret,
perhaps something

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
of unimaginable value hidden
under the ice in Antarctica?

group of military people,

including the head of Skunk
Works, Lockheed Skunk Works--

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:10%
and they were going to come
into this from the ancient past,

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:10%
that the Anunnaki and the
Greeks were extraterrestrials.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
There was another
group working allegedly

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.550 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
astronauts, who were saying

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:90%
that they've encountered UFOs.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:10%
And they were going to
come into an announcement.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:10%
I was told that the Vatican
in Rome, Pope Francis,

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:10%
has been standing, waiting
to collaborate with whichever

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:10%
of these groups would be the
ones that would tell the truth.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:10%
We're not alone in the universe.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:10%
The Vatican is ready to stand
up with whoever in the United

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:10%
States makes that announcement.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:10%
Behind the scenes, there
was a Signore Balducci who

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:10%
said that the Vatican
had information

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:55.020 align:middle line:10%
about extraterrestrials and
that there was a decision made

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.790 align:middle line:10%
in the beginning of the '90s
that the Vatican was-- would

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:10%
support announcements of
the existence of other life

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:10%
in the universe and say,
this reinforces the size

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:10%
and the strength of God.

>> About 55,000 to
60,000 years ago,

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.710 align:middle line:84%
a group of beings that
originated on Mars may have

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:90%
crash-landed in Antarctica.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.780 align:middle line:84%
This group happened to
have very elongated skulls.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Not only did they
have elongated skulls,

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:84%
but they were about
14 feet tall and had

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.960 align:middle line:90%
very strange physiology.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Researchers have stated
that it is obvious

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.730 align:middle line:84%
that these beings did not
develop on Earth, that they had

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
developed in a different area,
where the barometric pressure

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.030 align:middle line:90%
was different.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:84%
The gravitational
fields were different.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And it explains the differences
in their physiology.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Could an A-tier group have
understood all of the science

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and built all of these pyramids
right there on the island

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
because they needed to
tap into an energy source?

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.120 align:middle line:10%
So the pyramid is harnessing
incredible energy.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:10%
We see pyramids in Africa,
and there's pyramids in Sudan

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.690 align:middle line:10%
and all over the world.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:84%
There are actually forgotten
pyramids in Indonesia.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:10%
So the pyramid is truly
a worldwide phenomenon

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:10%
that completely defies
anything that makes sense,

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:10%
unless you are well-read
in Russian science torsion

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:10%
fields, the science of
biology and active energy that

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:10%
will in fact feed life and
make life healthier and more

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.240 align:middle line:10%
vibrant, because that's exactly
what happened in the pyramids.

Let's say that you inject
a white laboratory mouse

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.490 align:middle line:10%
with a virus or a toxin that
would normally cause a disease

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:10%
condition to develop
in approximately 30%

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:10%
of the specimens.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
If you give them pyramid energy,
instead of 30% mortality,

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:90%
you only get about 3% mortality.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.230 align:middle line:10%
And even in cases where
the white mice were

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:10%
given doses of toxins
so high that 60% of them

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:10%
would die very quickly,
only 6% of the mice

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:10%
died in the presence of
the pyramid energy fields.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.900 align:middle line:84%
There were experiments done
with granite slabs that

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.297 align:middle line:84%
were stored in the pyramids and
then positioned in the prisons.

00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:09.630 align:middle line:10%
And all the prisoners who had
the granite in their cells

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:10%
suddenly had massive
improvements in their behavior.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:90%
They became friendlier.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.360 align:middle line:90%
They became happier.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:84%
The violence was
significantly decreased,

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and nothing else was done.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.150 align:middle line:90%
It was really incredible.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there scientific
principles and mathematical

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
codes intrinsic to the nature
of the pyramid shape that this

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
ancient race might
have understood?

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The pyramid is a
really interesting symbol.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it comes from
the divine mind itself,

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:84%
because the top
point of the pyramid

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
represents the
unity or the center,

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
the central axis of
the divine monad,

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.195 align:middle line:84%
whereas the base
is actually a cube

00:25:48.195 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
and represents the four
elements and the dimensions

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:90%
of spacetime.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.030 align:middle line:10%
So through the model or
symbol of the pyramid,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.890 align:middle line:10%
you see the whole
flow from unity

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:03.770 align:middle line:10%
into multiplicity as an
entire thing or wholeness.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.390 align:middle line:10%
>> I think of other monuments
that were purposely buried,

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.120 align:middle line:10%
maybe because they
were too powerful,

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.720 align:middle line:10%
maybe because the creatures
that built them didn't want us

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:10%
to destroy ourselves
with that technology.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe those areas, if
you go deep enough,

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.990 align:middle line:84%
have the kind of rock
strata necessary in order

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.190 align:middle line:84%
to cause these vibrational
frequencies to occur.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If the pre-Adamites existed
and Antarctica was their base

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.970 align:middle line:84%
where they built powerful
pyramids to affect the planet,

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:84%
how would revealing this
now affect the world we live

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.993 align:middle line:90%
in today?

00:26:39.993 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But it does seem that this
civilization would have been

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:84%
literally indestructible as
we moved into the final 12,000

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.690 align:middle line:90%
years of this big cycle.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So what appears to have
happened is that, in fact, there

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
was a judgment made to
allow this flood to occur

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and that the flood not only
sank the Atlantean continent,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:90%
making it Antarctica.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:84%
But it also did sink
many other areas

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:84%
of megalithic architecture,
such as the gorgeous pyramid

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
that we see in the Azores
off the coast of Portugal,

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.060 align:middle line:84%
such as the sunken
architecture we see off

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.430 align:middle line:84%
the western tip of
Cuba, and what we

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:90%
see around the coast of India.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.230 align:middle line:84%
What we see in Japan is where
you have a sunken architecture

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of anomalies
are being discovered

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that defy the conventional
view, Gobekli Tepe in Turkey

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:90%
just being another example.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.402 align:middle line:84%
It appears that this was a
benevolently designed event,

00:27:26.402 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:84%
which had the purpose of
giving these negative groups

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:84%
their karma, to wipe
them out in a way

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that their karma had invited,
authorized, and paved

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:84%
the way for a humanity that
is not so corrupt, negative,

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and evil to be able to use
Earth for its own benefit.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this pre-Adamite
culture have created

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:84%
a different kind of world using
their knowledge of pyramid

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.580 align:middle line:90%
building?

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Was their influence
positive or negative

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of Earth?

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:84%
If there was such a
species that existed,

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
could this represent a
different genetic code

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.520 align:middle line:90%
than that of humans?

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that this
different species was almost

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:84%
destroyed in a cataclysm,
a cataclysm that

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
encouraged the survival
of the human species

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:90%
to shepherd the Earth?

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.870 align:middle line:84%
As Antarctica continues to
melt away more evidence,

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.820 align:middle line:84%
a location on the
other side of the globe

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
reveals elongated heads
and a planetary alignment

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.538 align:middle line:84%
that leaves experts baffled
on its ancient connection.

00:28:22.538 --> 00:28:25.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a theory that
in addition to the influence

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:36.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun and the Moon and
the power of the eclipses,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:42.810 align:middle line:84%
that Stonehenge has a connection
with the influence of Saturn.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Could elongated heads
also be traced to Stonehenge?

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that
this monument is

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:10%
connected with certain planets?

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Up next, the code
keeps unraveling

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.870 align:middle line:84%
as we head to Europe's
oldest stone circle.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:06.000 align:middle line:90%
