00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> On the northwest edge of
the volcanic Ring of Fire is

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
the mysterious land
known as China.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:10%
Legends of ascended masters
echo throughout this region,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:10%
where abandoned megalithic
quarries, underground temples,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:10%
and pyramids provide
clues to a time

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:10%
before the Earth endured
1,200 years of climate chaos

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:10%
throughout the
Younger Dryas period.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:84%
As alternative
researchers examine

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
the pre-diluvian
evidence and wisdom

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
from this mythological
province, there is little doubt

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
that this land of
the dragons has

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
had a powerful
influence on humanity

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:90%
throughout ancient history.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:90%


00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost universally ancient
texts and traditions tell us

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
that we are living in a
world that they call a dream.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:90%
We're living in illusion.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:10%
Along with those
ancient traditions,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:10%
we've always been
given the opportunity

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:10%
to have guides that
help us along the way

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:10%
or what many people
call ascended masters.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
All of this points to a
unity and a continuity

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.330 align:middle line:84%
in our experience that
there is a knowledge,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
and there is a wisdom
that began long ago.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we embrace what that
wisdom means to us today,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:84%
it gives us what we
need to become the best

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.540 align:middle line:84%
versions of ourselves
and, certainly, to create

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:90%
the best world possible.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Some people have trouble with
the whole concept of ascended

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.130 align:middle line:10%
masters, of this idea of
humans who have transformed

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.920 align:middle line:10%
into higher spiritual beings.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:10%
But almost every world
tradition speaks of this.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:84%
In the ASEAN tradition,
the Jewish mystics

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Jesus, they
spoke of a pre-flood race

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:84%
of perfect light
humans who existed side

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
by side with the
rest of humanity

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and continued to influence
humanity after the cataclysm.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Perfect light humans is very
resonant with the concept

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:90%
of ascended masters.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So in different
historical traditions,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
we find references
to a parallel version

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:84%
of humanity-- an ascended or
enlightened version of humanity

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
that coexists with
the rest of humanity.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:10%
>> At the end of Younger Dryas--
and you had this incredible

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:10%
catastrophe which reshapes
the entire world--

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:10%
you have groups of people called
the Seven Sages, the Seven

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.110 align:middle line:10%
Rishi, the Seven Ascended
Masters, all seven, and they

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:10%
all share the same attributes.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.777 align:middle line:84%
And they all seem
to be coming out

00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:10.630 align:middle line:84%
of this central
location in the Pacific,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
towards the mainland.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
It seems that they
lived on islands,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and it was only
the fact that they

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
had lost their homelands
that forced them

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:90%
onto the continental shelf.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's at this
moment in history

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
where we, as hunter-gatherers
at the time, suddenly,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:84%
inherited these
incredible stories

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:90%
of the arrival of Seven Sages.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And they helped kick
start civilization.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:90%
So you have it in Japan.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:90%
You have it in China.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You have it all the way
around the Asian coastline.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And you have also
the appearance out

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:90%
of nowhere of these teachings.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And the one unifying
thing is the fact

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
that they are described exactly
the same way the teachings

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:90%
follow the same principles.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They're brought there during
the same period of time,

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
and they also
achieved the same aim,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
which is the enlightenment
of the individual.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And the school of
thought and the direction

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
from where all these
ideas come always

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.900 align:middle line:84%
end up going back to the
center of the Pacific.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:84%
In the ascended
master tradition,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:84%
we're told that the Ascended
Masters went to various places

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
around the planet,
especially high places--

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu, Tibet,
other places in China.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Even the Great
Pyramid are locations

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:84%
where they were repositories for
the knowledge of the Ascended

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Masters, where they
specifically took this knowledge

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
for safekeeping and would
be able to then retrieve it

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:90%
after the cataclysm.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So this seems to be one of
the key roles of the Ascended

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Masters is to assist
humanity in their development

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and then to preserve
knowledge and elements

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:84%
of our civilization
in times of cataclysm.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Throughout history, China
has been the legendary home

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:10%
of several spiritual masters,
such as Confucius, Guanyin,

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:10%
and Lao Tzu.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:10%
The creation myths
of NÃ¼wa and Fuxi

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:10%
mirror that of several
other cultures.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:10%
But when alternative researchers
compare physical evidence

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.880 align:middle line:10%
from China with other ancient
sites around the planet,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:10%
the mystery and
lore of this land

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:10%
adds more cracks in
the mainstream timeline

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:10%
for the rise of civilization.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:10%
>> China is a very
interesting culture.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:10%
Today, it represents the
longest running and still

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:10%
running culture
anywhere on the planet.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:10%
I think what is also
very interesting

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:10%
about China is that there
is significant evidence

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:10%
for a pre-existing
or prior civilization

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:10%
that may have existed
in that same region.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
You also have really interesting
and mysterious locations

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.310 align:middle line:84%
that seem to point to a much
longer history of civilization

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle line:90%
in that area.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And some of that may tie back to
any of the ancient civilization

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:90%
stories, be they Mu or Atlantis.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's clear is
that there was this-- whatever

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.530 align:middle line:84%
ancient civilization was on
the planet during that time.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
They were certainly
occupying the area

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:90%
that we call China today.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Everyone is so focused
on looking at ancient Egypt

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:10%
or ancient South America that
they don't even realize that

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.520 align:middle line:10%
there's unbelievably big,
megalithic cut stone is

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.320 align:middle line:10%
in China.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:10%
And I think we all need to
be having a much deeper look

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.200 align:middle line:10%
at that side of the world.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Of all the evidence
around the world from ancient

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:10%
civilizations that seem to
predate the Younger Dryas,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:10%
what we find is that China seems
to have reached the greatest

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:10%
sophistication in terms of
megalithic construction of any

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:10%
of the civilizations
in the world.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And the best place we
can find that is a place

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:90%
called the Yangshan Quarry.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The Yangshan Quarry
contains, by far,

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:84%
the largest megalithic
single block

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:90%
ever cut in human history.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
To give a comparison for
understanding how large it is,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.300 align:middle line:84%
the second largest block we have
from a megalithic civilization

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.770 align:middle line:90%
is in Baalbek, Lebanon.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
In the quarry at
Baalbek, Lebanon,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
there is an unfinished
block that is 1,200 tons.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.140 align:middle line:84%
For comparison's sake,
at the Yangshan Quarry,

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.455 align:middle line:84%
the unfinished block that
was being incorporated

00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:84%
into the rest of
their structures

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.450 align:middle line:90%
is estimated to be 16,000 tons.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The other curious thing
that relates the two places,

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:10%
both Baalbek and Yangshan, are
that it appears that something

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.320 align:middle line:10%
caused the instantaneous
stoppage of work,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:10%
as if there was some kind
of cataclysmic event that

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:10%
happened, maybe at the
same time, maybe not.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.715 align:middle line:84%
That caused work at both
locations to immediately cease.

00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
The large stones in
Yangshan are likely

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.820 align:middle line:84%
the largest megalithic
block attempt

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:84%
at cutting huge stone in all of
the world, in all of history.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Think about it for a second.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
You have a block so large, that
even with our modern cranes

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:84%
today, and all of
our technology,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
we'd be unable to
move this block.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:18.030 align:middle line:84%
How is this ancient civilization
even able to cut it or move it?

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Now some have speculated that
it's a natural formation,

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's so
large and impossible.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I would urge people to study
the actual site itself.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And what you do, when you
look into the ancient quarry,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:84%
is you find, it's
a complex that's

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.049 align:middle line:90%
part of something much greater.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a
set of structures.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, this massive, massive
block that's 16,000 tons,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:84%
you find that it was in the
process of being dressed,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:84%
moved, and put into place
with the existing structures

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:90%
that were there.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Because underneath the block,
we found these massive grooves

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
that were cut in
underneath to basically

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
almost lift the whole thing
out of the host stone.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:10%
Now, nearby, these enormous
set of pillars of rock

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:10%
that they've basically
already finished carving

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:10%
have these types of
grooves cut into them

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:10%
that seem impossible
with any tools

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.340 align:middle line:10%
present to any
civilization we know of.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
When we look into
the sophistication

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
of the 90-degree angles in some
of the cuts of these squares

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:84%
that are taken out
of these blocks,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
it baffles researchers
today on what

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:90%
could have even carved that.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:84%
What could have even made
those types of grooves,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
especially not using
Bronze Age tools.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that's compelling is that

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
on these finished structures
are these gigantic knob-like

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:90%
intrusions.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Now that type of
knob-like feature

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
is the telltale
sign that connects

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
other pre-diluvian
civilizations around the world.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>> At the ancient
quarry in China,

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:84%
we find these curious
protrusions or knobs,

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and you also see evidence of
those also in Peru at different

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
locations, and the Menkaure
third pyramid on the Giza

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Plateau in Egypt.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Now the conventional
story is that the knobs

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
were there so that
the workers could

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
put a rope underneath where
the knob is and then lift it up

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and push the stone
into position.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking about
the Yangshan Quarry stone

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.350 align:middle line:84%
being 16,000 tons,
that is way beyond

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:84%
the capacity of any
human civilization

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
manipulate whatsoever.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So I think, honestly, the
knobs were a leftover artifact

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
during the construction
at all of these locations

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and probably had something
to do with energy.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Or that they were
left there on purpose

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
as simply the result
of the manufacturing

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.690 align:middle line:84%
process, that they
were an artifact that

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
was to be cut off at some point
to make the surface smooth.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
work stopped,

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:90%
as we said, at these locations.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore, the knobs
still exist as artifacts

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.540 align:middle line:90%
of the manufacturing process.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The Yangshan Quarry is
one of the more fascinating

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious places
that you'll find anywhere

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.300 align:middle line:84%
It represents a class of other
unfinished massive megalithic

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.130 align:middle line:84%
projects that we see
all around the world.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
the unfinished obelisk

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
that's in the Aswan
Quarry in Egypt,

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
approximately 1,200 tons also
still attached to the bedrock.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:84%
We have the unfinished
quarrying works at Baalbek,

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
with stones approaching 2,000
tons in the quarry over there.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And also, in Egypt, it's
a lesser known site,

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
but there's something
called the Minya Quarry.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Giant limestone
megaliths attached

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to the bedrock, one
of these weighing up

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
approximately 5,000
tons, again, hasn't

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:90%
been removed from the bedrock.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a trend that we see on
a lot of the megalithic sites

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:84%
around the world that, for
some reason, at some point,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:90%
work was just stopped.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Something interrupted a
lot of these projects.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever reason that was
potentially, it was cataclysm.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.880 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these
megalithic projects

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
seem to have just been abandoned
and stopped midway through.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> As humanity endured 1,200
years of chaotic weather

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.070 align:middle line:84%
patterns during the
Younger Dryas period,

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:84%
underground sites around the
planet are thought to have

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
helped humanity live through
this dramatic time period.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:10%
An astounding discovery located
between Hong Kong and Shanghai

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:10%
deepens the mystery
around the length of time

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:10%
the ancient inhabitants of
China lived underground.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most interesting
discoveries in recent times

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:10%
anywhere in the world is
the Longyou Caves of China.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:10%
Now these are remarkable.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:10%
These were first
discovered only in 1992

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:10%
by a local villager who was
draining some of his ponds,

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:10%
and he found these huge caves.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.500 align:middle line:10%
When they descended down into
these caves, initially, five.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:10%
Although, there are
actually about 24 of them,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:10%
19 still have to be excavated
or even drained of water.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:10%
But the five that have
been properly drained

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:28.420 align:middle line:10%
and have been looked into are
these incredibly vast chambers

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:33.940 align:middle line:10%
with these pillars, which are
over 100 feet tall inside them.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.140 align:middle line:10%
And they have this
incredible acoustic ability.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Any sound is carried
throughout of them,

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:10%
and they stretch for about
120 feet in one direction,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:10%
possibly about 60 to
70 feet in another.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:10%
They are aligned so that the sun
shines down in them perfectly.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.390 align:middle line:10%
But also, there is only just
one entrance down into them.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:10%
And this is down through
a vertical staircase that

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.410 align:middle line:10%
allows not just
sunlight, but also water

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:10%
to enter inside them.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And the water would be
channeled through them so

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.290 align:middle line:90%
that it wouldn't just fill up.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
this was a part

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:90%
of the actual design of them.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:10%
Some of the caves have got
the most beautiful frescoes

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:10%
on the walls that have
been chiseled into them.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:10%
And these show animals.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:10%
They show human beings
and also dragons.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:10%
There's dragons
curling their way

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:10%
around some of these pillars.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But also, in addition to
that, the actual chamfering

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
of the walls, the chisel
marks are actually unique.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.800 align:middle line:10%
They're in these
strange parallel lines,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:10%
which seem to be found nowhere
else in the Eurasian continent.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:10%
>> There are tool marks--

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:10%
horizontal tool marks going
from the bottom, all the way

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.660 align:middle line:10%
to the top, which could not
have been done with hand tools.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:10%
They seem to be bands
of about 2 feet,

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.505 align:middle line:10%
going all the way from
the bottom to the top.

00:15:08.505 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:10%
And I think that
would have had to have

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.750 align:middle line:10%
been done by some kind of very
advanced ancient technology,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:10%
long before the existence of
what we presently call China.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:10%
But by a very
advanced civilization

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:10%
that existed long before
what conventional history

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:10%
calls history, so into
the realm of prehistory.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So perhaps, there was some
kind of ancient technology,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:90%
ancient machining that did this.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people have even speculated
that aliens came down and did

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
this because they needed
a certain type of stone

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:90%
to take away with them.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.772 align:middle line:84%
Because no one really
knows where the stone went,

00:15:42.772 --> 00:15:43.640 align:middle line:90%
what happened to it.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no rubble.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no dust.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.880 align:middle line:10%
And this is sandstone as well.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:10%
So this isn't a soft stone
we're dealing with here.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:10%
It's a pretty tough stone.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:10%
- One of the things
that's baffling

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:10%
is that there's no evidence
of their construction.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:10%
Over a million
metric tons of stone

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:10%
were removed from those caverns.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But when archeologists
go around the area,

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.030 align:middle line:90%
they can't find any of it.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things
that mystifies them

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:84%
is that there isn't any
evidence of the people that

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.350 align:middle line:90%
built these caves.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no villages or
cemeteries or work areas.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're looking
at the Longyou Caves,

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:90%
some comparisons could be made.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
This is like an
underground city almost.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:10%
And so, it's got
comparisons, really,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:10%
with places like
Derinkuyu or Kaymakli

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:10%
in the Cappadocia region of
Turkey, which, potentially, are

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:10%
tens of thousands of years old.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
No one really knows
how old they are.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And so, even though they found
pottery in the Longyou Caves

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
that date to around
2,000 years ago,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that's
when they were built.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.330 align:middle line:10%
They could be much older and
completely forgotten about.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.590 align:middle line:10%
>> They could have been places
of refuge during some kind

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:10%
of cataclysm.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:10%
Now which cataclysm
that would be?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:10%
We don't know.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.343 align:middle line:10%
It could be the Younger Dryas,
or it could have been something

00:17:06.343 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:10%
much later, something much
more local within China itself.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:84%
But we can see similarities
between those caves and those,

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:90%
for instance, at Derinkuyu.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:84%
And here, you have these
vast underground cities,

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:84%
which were constructed over a
period of time of which we have

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.190 align:middle line:84%
no real understanding
of what was going on,

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:84%
why they would
have been created.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
The archeologists have no
idea who created these caves

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:84%
or what their function
might have been.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.790 align:middle line:10%
What makes this such
a fascinating place

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:10%
is that the way that this
entire cave system seems

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:10%
to be designed is based
on their harmonics

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.257 align:middle line:10%
and tuning with consciousness
in the human frequency.

00:17:54.257 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The reason we know that
is the way that the walls are

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:10%
designed, it has acoustic
properties that are very

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:10%
specifically in tune with
the human consciousness.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:10%
And the more we look
into the specifics of how

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:10%
advanced this cave
is, the more we

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:10%
see it seems to be some kind of
an oracle chamber for reaching

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:10%
higher states of consciousness,
a place that some

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:10%
of these adepts in
these sages and masters

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.490 align:middle line:10%
could go and seek a
place to practice,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:10%
to reach these higher states.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:27.070 align:middle line:10%
>> The Longyou Caves are not
only places of refuge during

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:10%
times of cataclysm, but
they are what are referred

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:10%
to as hypogeums, a term
that's most obviously used

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:10%
in connection with
the hypogeum in Malta,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:10%
which is another
underground complex,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:10%
which we know was used
for ritual purposes.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
commonality with all

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:90%
of these places underground.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> As more evidence continues
to surface of a potential

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:84%
pre-diluvian
civilization in China,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:84%
the area around Sian holds
more mysterious clues.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:84%
In 1912, while walking
through the Shaanxi Province,

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
American travel agent
Fred Meier Schroeder

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%
spotted a giant white pyramid.

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1945, this
pyramid was introduced

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
to the Western world,
when a US Army pilot named

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:27.400 align:middle line:84%
James Gaussman reported
and allegedly photographed

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:84%
a huge white pyramid while
flying over a valley, Southwest

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:90%
of Sian.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:84%
A few years later,
"The New York Times"

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.760 align:middle line:84%
used Gaussman's
alleged photograph

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.090 align:middle line:84%
and reported a story from
the director of Trans World

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Airlines, Colonel
Morris Sheahan,

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:84%
stating that he was flying over
a Valley Southwest of Sian,

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.830 align:middle line:90%
when he spotted a huge pyramid.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Further stories
surfaced, and the pyramid

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:84%
was later identified
as the well known tomb

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
of Emperor Wu of Han,
located Northwest of Sian.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Could these sightings
from the 1900s

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
be pointing to a different
pyramid than this emperor's

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:84%
tomb, and how many
other pyramids does

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:90%
this mysterious region hold?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other fascinating
archeological discoveries

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:84%
in China are the pyramids
of the Sian Province.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.950 align:middle line:10%
Now there are dozens of these
pyramids all over the area,

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.870 align:middle line:10%
many of them are now
almost covered up

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:10%
with orchards and forests
and things like this.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.250 align:middle line:84%
But some of them
are quite famous.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
The famous one with
the Terracotta Army

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:84%
was found underneath
it and so forth.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And these are supposed to be
the mausoleums or the burial

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:84%
places of ancient
emperors going back

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:90%
a couple of thousand years.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:90%
But some of these are huge.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.200 align:middle line:84%
We have the famous
white pyramid,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
it was called when it
was first discovered.

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
It was first spotted
by people flying

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.880 align:middle line:84%
over the area in
the early 1900s.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And this caused a
sensation because pyramids

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:90%
aren't supposed to exist there.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:90%
They exist in Mexico.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
They existed in Egypt,
but that was it, really.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But now, they're being
found everywhere.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:84%
We have the Black Stone
Pyramids of Sicily and Tenerife

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.700 align:middle line:90%
and Mauritius.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.370 align:middle line:84%
We also have a
ziggurat type structure

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.160 align:middle line:84%
found in Northern Sardinia
called Monte d'Accoddi, which

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:90%
dates back 6,000 years.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
We have the temples in Cambodia
and Southeast Asia, which

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
are very similar to
some of the pyramids we

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.070 align:middle line:90%
find in Guatemala and Mexico.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.880 align:middle line:90%
And the list goes on.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So the ones in China, to
me, it just represents

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
this global awareness
and global conversation

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that was taking place
in ancient times,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:84%
where the technologies,
the building styles,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and the constructions are found
with a very similar style all

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Pyramid building is a
phenomenon that exists all

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you can attribute either
the roots of that tradition

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and the seeds of that idea
to a common ancestor culture,

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.650 align:middle line:84%
then, for sure, I think
that the civilization that

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
built the pyramids in China
were likely part of that

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.390 align:middle line:90%
or certainly connected to it.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Besides the wonders
of the Longyou Caves,

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:10%
the Yangshan Quarry, and
the Great White Pyramid,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:10%
the most sophisticated structure
we find in China is known

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.800 align:middle line:10%
as the Tomb of the General.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Now much that we find in
other parts of the world,

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:84%
there's never been evidence
of any general that

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:90%
was ever buried here.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Was this actually a tomb?

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:10%
The more we've looked into
studied this structure, as well

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:10%
as the similarities it
has to other pre-diluvian

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:10%
megalithic pyramids and temples
around the world, the more

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:10%
that we find that it
may have been mislabeled

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:10%
and misrepresented
as being a tomb,

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:10%
when it's actually a
sacred temple pyramid.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
That's very similar to a
structure such as Teotihuacan

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
in Mexico, one of these
pyramids with a flat top.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Now the reason why we know
that this structure was not

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:84%
built to be a tomb was
that the blocks that

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:84%
were used to build it were
some of the most highly

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated megalithic
construction we see anywhere

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:84%
in the world, telling us that
it was from this time period

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.580 align:middle line:90%
before the Younger Dryas.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the seven levels
of the Tomb of the General,

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:84%
is that supposed to
represent the seven

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
levels of higher consciousness,
the seven chakras?

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.240 align:middle line:84%
It seems to represent these
higher states of consciousness.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:84%
So we must reevaluate all
of these ancient structures,

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:84%
like the Tomb of the General,
to give it an entirely different

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
purpose in light,
to understand what

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.780 align:middle line:90%
its true purpose was long ago.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.140 align:middle line:10%
>> As the relics scattered
throughout China point

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:10%
to a time of sophisticated
masonry and architecture,

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.000 align:middle line:10%
the question remains--

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:10%
when were these relics
created, and how advanced

00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:10%
was this ancient civilization?

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient ancestors,
once upon a time,

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.320 align:middle line:84%
how technologically and
scientifically advanced were

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:90%
they?

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:11.970 align:middle line:10%
Do we assume that they were all
basically just nomadic hunter

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.570 align:middle line:10%
gatherers for 200,000 years?

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
after the Younger Dryas,

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:84%
we invent urban complexes,
domestication of animals,

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.240 align:middle line:90%
we create all these languages.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Did all of that just happen
within that millennia or two

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
after the last
global catastrophe?

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And then for 200,000
years before that,

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:84%
we never advanced
beyond hunter gatherers?

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And if we did advance,
how far did we advanced?

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we advanced
scientifically

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and technologically, do we
assume that it looked just

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:90%
like what we've done?

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we're looking for a
mirror of our own civilization

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
in the past, we may not
find it because it may not

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
have looked anything like
our own civilization.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.220 align:middle line:10%
See, this opens up all kinds
of interesting possibilities

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:10%
that, I think, are
worth exploring.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:10%
I think it was William Davis,
the founder of geomorphology,

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:10%
back in the early 20th century
was castigating his colleagues.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Because he said, you guys
need to expand your thinking

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and quit being so
afraid of what he called

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.430 align:middle line:90%
the outrageous hypothesis.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Because, sometimes, maybe
that outrageous hypothesis

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
may explain things better
than the more normal stuff.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's mind-boggling,
the precision,

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:84%
the way that they
could cut stones,

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:90%
these ancient civilizations.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
They could smooth stone,
shape stone, and move stone.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
But in a time period
that, according

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
to traditional
archeology, they shouldn't

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:90%
have been able to do that.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Or they couldn't have
done it with the tools

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:84%
that we have in the
archeological record.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So it really points to the
idea that these guys had

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:90%
a skill set that we've lost.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It was lost at some point
between then and now.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.800 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:84%
We cannot replicate and move
stones in the same way that

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
these civilizations could.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So to me, it really highlights
and points to an idea

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:84%
that we have lost
something in time.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Something happened that
stopped the progression

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:90%
of that technology.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.067 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't know everything yet.

00:26:22.067 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
We're still-- there's
whole areas of science

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're only just
beginning to explore,

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's certainly
possible to me

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.090 align:middle line:84%
that ancient civilizations
may have progressed down

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:84%
an entirely different
field of technology,

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:84%
an entirely different
field of science, something

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.420 align:middle line:90%
that we don't fully understand.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:10%
So when we look at
the past, and we

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.250 align:middle line:10%
look at these puzzles
that are presented

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.310 align:middle line:10%
to us in the form of
megalithic architecture

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.540 align:middle line:10%
or precision-made
massive stone objects,

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:10%
we have to be open-minded
enough to consider

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:10%
the fact that the
solutions to these problems

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:10%
may exist outside of our current
sphere of reference or outside

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.020 align:middle line:10%
of our current
field of technology.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And doing it that way
is really the only way

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're ever going to
learn something about it.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.520 align:middle line:84%
If we just dismiss it
and say, no, no, this

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:84%
was all done by hand, and it
was done with copper chisels,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
then we're not going
to get anywhere.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But if we take an
open-minded approach,

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and we analyze these
objects, we might actually

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.440 align:middle line:84%
stand to learn
something and develop

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:84%
some skills for our own
civilization in the process.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.760 align:middle line:10%
>> As the discoveries from
China continue to challenge

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:10%
the mainstream timeline for
the rise of civilization,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:10%
what other evidence will be
discovered to link the ancient

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:10%
inhabitants of this mysterious
land to the powerful

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:48.820 align:middle line:10%
pre-diluvian civilizations
of Mu and Atlantis that were

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:10%
destroyed but not forgotten?

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:90%
