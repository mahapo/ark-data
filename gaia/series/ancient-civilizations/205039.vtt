00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> The Giza Plateau--

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
this infamous,
rectangular-shaped area

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:84%
overlooks the Nile Valley and
is only 5 miles from Cairo.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Here, people come from
all over the world

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
to gaze upon the
pyramids and the Sphinx.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But below these magnificent
structures lies a slew

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.640 align:middle line:84%
of myths, legends, and
documented evidence

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
of an underworld so vast
the human mind cannot even

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:90%
conceptualize its existence.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.660 align:middle line:84%
What could lie below
the Giza Plateau?

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:90%
Could it be an ancient city?

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:90%
A military base?

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Or the remnants of the gods?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
that whatever could

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
be buried below the surface
of this ancient area

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.690 align:middle line:84%
is the key to understanding
the very beginnings of humanity

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:90%
on this planet?

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden points to
the first documented

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:90%
source of its existence.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Some of the earliest credible
accounts of the Giza Plateau

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:10%
and what could be underneath
the Giza Plateau come from

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.880 align:middle line:10%
the Greek historian Herodotus.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It was during his life
in the 4th century--

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:90%
approximately 4th century BCE--

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
when he compiled a record
that he called "The Histories"

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.190 align:middle line:84%
of ancient civilizations,
ancient cultures,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
ancient technologies
that predate his time

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
by thousands and
thousands of years.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was in his volume, "The
Histories," that Herodotus

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:90%
began to talk about Giza.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And underneath Giza,
beyond what the eye

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
can see with the pyramids and
the Sphinx and the temples

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:84%
during his time, he speculated
that there were passages.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:90%
There were chambers.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:90%
There were pathways.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were natural,
created by fast-moving water

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:84%
under the limestone
of the Giza Plateau.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were enhanced
by humans at a time

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
when this part of the world had
a very, very different climate

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:90%
than what we have right now.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus believed that it
was in this location that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:84%
the remnants of the
ancient civilization--

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:90%
such as Atlantis--

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:84%
were able to store the records,
the histories, the writings,

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and the examples of technologies
from their time that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.330 align:middle line:84%
would be preserved for
future generations following

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Herodotus.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Up until the 20th century, there
were additional speculations.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Maps were drawn.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:10%
Images were created
of what was believed

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:10%
to be underneath the
plateau without actually

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.950 align:middle line:10%
seeing these chambers
and these temples.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:10%
Two men, Henry
Salt and Giovanni,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:10%
were able to survey the area
with the technology that

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.840 align:middle line:10%
was available in their time.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the geographic
anomalies, the topology,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
it led them to a place
not at the plateau,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
not directly where
the pyramids are,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:84%
not directly where
the Sphinx is,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
but on the edge of the plateau
to a little known site that

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
is now called the
Tomb of the Birds.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this be one of the
entrances to the underworld?

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:10%
>> We know that the Tomb
of the Birds was venerated

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:10%
as the place of a bird god.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:10%
We don't know what god, but
it was most likely Thoth,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:10%
the keeper of the
hidden records,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that this is the
entrance that will eventually

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.270 align:middle line:10%
take us to the Hall
of Records themself.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:10%
But what we do know is that
overhead radar images that

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:10%
were taken by satellites
very clearly tell us

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:10%
that there is a
passage that goes

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:10%
all the way from the northeast
corner of the plateau,

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:10%
in the area of the
Tomb of the Birds,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:10%
all the way to the
second pyramid.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Although there seems to be
documented evidence of the Tomb

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:10%
of the Birds, the actual
location of its entrance was

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:10%
lost to the curious until April
2008 when author and researcher

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Collins picked up the
breadcrumbs of Henry Salt.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Myself and a Egyptological
researcher by the name of Nigel

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Skinner Simpson decided that we
would try and find Giza's cave

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:90%
underworld.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And it took a while,
but finally we

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
found two vital
pieces of evidence.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:10%
One related to the
Colonel Howard Vyse,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:10%
who, with his engineer
friend, John Shae Perring,

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:10%
investigated a previously
unknown tomb in the exact area

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:10%
that we were
interested in, which

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:10%
was the northwest
corner of the plateau.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So we investigated
this site in 2007.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it wasn't
easy to get in there.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But we investigated it
and couldn't find anything

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:90%
initially.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, shortly after
I returned from Egypt,

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
we found these old
diary notes that

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
had been written in 1817 by
the British Consul-General

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
at the time, who was Henry
Salt. And he employed

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:90%
the services of explorers.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of these was the
Italian Giovanni Caviglia.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And Caviglia, for
instance, worked with Salt

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:84%
uncovering the sand
around these things.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
But they also
investigated the very area

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:90%
that we were interested in.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:10%
And these diary notes
talked about them,

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:10%
going into a cave system
and penetrating it

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:10%
for several hundred yards
and finding in there hidden

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:10%
chambers.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And we realized that
this was exactly

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
the same location that
we'd previously been to,

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
that we were beginning to
refer to under the name

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:90%
the Tomb of Birds.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So we went back
there in April 2008.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:10%
And this time, we looked harder,
and we found a small crack

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:10%
leading into this cave chamber,
this huge, massive cave

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:10%
chamber.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:10%
And we then began to
explore and realized

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:10%
that this was leading
into a cave system that

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:10%
led towards the second pyramid.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:10%
But this was a very hazardous,
very dangerous place.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:10%
Not only could you
fall down crevasses,

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:10%
there were rocks everywhere,
but there were also

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:10%
bats, thousands
of them, and also

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:10%
spiders, including some that
were very clearly poisonous.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.910 align:middle line:10%
And we penetrated deeper and
deeper into this cave system

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:10%
until the air became so bad
that it started to affect us.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:10%
And at this point, we came out.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:10%
And I wrote everything up,
but we reported it immediately

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:10%
to the Egyptian
authorities so that they

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:10%
were aware of everything
that was happening.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was a strange
story, because not only

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
did they initially deny that
there was a cave system there

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and claimed that we'd simply
gone into somewhere that

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:22.270 align:middle line:84%
was already known about, but
just a few months after this,

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:84%
the head of the Supreme Council
of Antiquities, Dr. Zahi

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Hawass, was seen going
into the site archives

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and saying that it was the
best experience that he'd

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.060 align:middle line:90%
had at Giza.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
caves that we discovered

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
is just the beginning of a huge,
great underground system that

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:50.270 align:middle line:84%
permeates a large part
of the Plateau at Giza.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, why haven't
there been any more discoveries

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:90%
since 2008?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
note, in 2010, just two

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
years after its discovery,
access to the tomb

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.750 align:middle line:90%
became blocked by a metal gate.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:10%
Could authorities
be trying to hide

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:10%
what seems to be a massive
underground system?

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> The one thing that we know
about Giza is that there is

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
a huge cave system there that
obviously has been rediscovered

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:90%
only recently.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:10%
But radar images taken
overhead from satellites

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:34.290 align:middle line:10%
show us that these caves go
beneath the second pyramid

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:10%
and that they likely go into
other parts of the plateau,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.570 align:middle line:10%
as well, possibly even
beneath the Great Pyramids.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And that tells us
that somewhere here

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:84%
could be a series
of hidden chambers

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:84%
that were actually hewn by
either the domestic Egyptians

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps even from
a much earlier age,

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
by the so-called elder
civilization that may well

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:84%
have existed at Giza
as early as 10,500 BC.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>> If what Andrew stumbled
upon was indeed an entrance

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:84%
to the underworld, could
there be other entrances?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Some experts believe that the
Sphinx might hold the key.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:10%
>> The hunt for some kind
of hidden chamber beneath

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:10%
the Plateau at Giza really went
into extra drive, if you like,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:10%
with the psychic
readings of Edgar Cayce.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, he is known as
America's sleeping prophet.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:44.280 align:middle line:10%
He was born in
1877, died in 1945.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.450 align:middle line:10%
And essentially
what he would do is

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:10%
he would give
these readings that

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.290 align:middle line:10%
would help diagnose
people's illnesses,

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:10%
and often these past lives
took place in ancient Egypt.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:84%
In 1933, he started
talking about something

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.015 align:middle line:90%
called the Hall of Records.

00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And what he said was that
this was the repository of all

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge and wisdom
that had been brought

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:84%
from the lost
continent of Atlantis

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
by the survivors, the
Atlantean survivors,

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
been brought into
Egypt and stored

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:84%
within this hidden chamber and
that this was located somewhere

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:90%
beneath the Plateau at Giza.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
He thought it was
accessed via an entrance

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the region
of the Great Sphinx.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> When Edgar Cayce's
foundation, the ARE,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
were exploring, it happened
that they were actually doing

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:84%
the seismic exploration during
a time that I was there with

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:90%
another group.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had the
opportunity to see.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:84%
In that time, it was a
relatively primitive form

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:90%
of seismic exploration.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
They took a very large man
with a very large sledgehammer,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and he literally pounded
onto a steel plate that

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:84%
was on the surface
of the desert,

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:84%
creating the shockwaves that
would go into the Earth.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And as they came
back up, if they

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.120 align:middle line:84%
went through an empty space,
they would travel faster.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:84%
If they went through solid
rock, they would travel slower.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:84%
That was registered on a
graph, and the graph clearly

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:84%
showed that there is a chamber
where Edgar Cayce had predicted

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:84%
it would be found under
the paws of the Sphinx.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Where this gets
really interesting

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:84%
is that the chamber appeared
to have stuff in it.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
What is unknown
is whether or not

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
that stuff is the collapse of
the ceiling into the chamber

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:84%
itself or if the
chamber, in fact,

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
is intact and is
full of artifacts

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.943 align:middle line:84%
from an ancient, highly advanced
civilization that Cayce talked

00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:90%
about in his readings.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:10%
>> We all have heard about the
explanations of Edgar Cayce

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:10%
talking about the Hall of
Records underground the Sphinx.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But we usually take the
explanations of the visions

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.280 align:middle line:90%
that we all have very literally.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But when we are
talking about halls,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
it's not about a big hall like
in our times or in Roman times.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
For the Atlantean
civilization, it

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.960 align:middle line:84%
was about how to
manage the information.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It was not only
about construction.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:90%
It's also about being concrete.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
They are the halls and
the past of records,

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:90%
and those records are water.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And all you have
underground the Giza Plateau

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:09.210 align:middle line:84%
is water, which is the tool that
they used to have the records.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever might
be below the Sphinx,

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
is it possible the foundation
ARE has found a hidden chamber

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.010 align:middle line:90%
under the Sphinx?

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Or could this just
be another entrance

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to what lies below
the Giza Plateau,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
possibly even connecting back
to a massive water system?

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Another mysterious possible
entrance on the plateau

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:90%
is the Osiris Shaft.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:10%
>> The Greek historian Herodotus
visited the Giza Plateau

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:10%
in around 450 BC.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And he clearly spoke to
the priests and the elders

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:84%
who were looking after
the different tombs

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and the pyramids.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And according to
his story, he said

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that the builder of
the Great Pyramid

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:84%
was Cheops, who we
know today as Khufu.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:10%
And what he said was that the
pharaoh himself wasn't actually

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:10%
buried inside the pyramid
but that he was actually

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:10%
placed within a tomb that
was located on an island

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.700 align:middle line:10%
deep beneath the plateau and
that, around this island,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:10%
water would flow in from
the Nile to surround it.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But what is so interesting
about this account

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
is that the place
that he describes

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:84%
matches almost exactly the
so-called Osiris Shaft.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a very mysterious
underground structure

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that's accessed from an entrance
beneath the causeway linked

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to the second pyramid that's
on three different levels.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom,
the lowest level,

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:84%
is an island where water
would come in from the Nile,

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and there is a tomb and
a sarcophagus set down

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:90%
into that rocky island.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And it matches exactly
what Herodotus tells us.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.290 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
>> If Herodotus was the first
account of an underground

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
labyrinth below the Giza Plateau
and his depiction of the tomb

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:84%
happens to exist, what
else can be verified?

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:10%
In 1997, Gregg Braden was
allowed special access

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.730 align:middle line:10%
to the Osiris Shaft after
a letter was provided

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.425 align:middle line:10%
by the President Hosni Mubarak.

00:16:42.425 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:10%
>> And one of the first places
that I was allowed to go was

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:10%
under the causeway between the
Great Sphinx and the middle

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:10%
pyramid into an area
that, at that time,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:10%
was only recently opened
and was the subject of a lot

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:10%
of speculation-- the
tomb of the Osiris.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:10%
And it was said
that this tomb was

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.569 align:middle line:10%
one of the passageways that led
to this underground labyrinth.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:19.016 align:middle line:84%
We were led to a
locked iron gate.

00:17:19.016 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:90%
The gate was opened.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:90%
We went inside.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had the
opportunity to climb

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
down through a series
of ladders, for me,

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:31.370 align:middle line:84%
only down to the third level
under the surface of the Giza

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Plateau.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that level that
the water table prevented us

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:90%
from going any further.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a
sarcophagus that is there.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And many people believe that
that was the end of the tomb

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and that sarcophagus underwater
was holding the body of Osiris.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But what our guides told us
that their grandfather had told

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
them was that that sarcophagus
is a false sarcophagus.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't hold a body.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
When you open the
sarcophagus, it

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
reveals the ladder
that goes down

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.650 align:middle line:84%
into the deeper levels of
this complex underneath Giza.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a geologist, I find
this really interesting,

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:84%
because when we talk
about this complex,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:84%
was it built before the
pyramids and the Sphinx or were

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids and the Sphinx
built and then these tunnels

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:90%
were carved later?

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how
would that be done?

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The geology of the Giza Plateau
is primarily sedimentary--

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:90%
a lot of limestone and dolomite.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:84%
These are sedimentary--
relatively soft sedimentary

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:84%
deposits that are the
result of a lot of water.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And the water also can carve
the tunnels and the chambers.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this
is what we're seeing

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
is a natural system of
tunnels and chambers

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
that nature has
created that have

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:04.970 align:middle line:84%
been enhanced by humans in
times of antiquity, in the past.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Although Gregg couldn't
go beyond the third level,

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Sonja Grace was able
to go beyond the veil.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And she explains
that the Osiris Shaft

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
has many more layers and rooms
that have yet to be discovered.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:10%
>> When I spirit traveled back
to Egypt and there were these

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:10%
guards standing there in
front of Osiris' Shaft,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:10%
they allowed us to pass, and
we started descending down

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:10%
the ladder.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.860 align:middle line:84%
There's standing water
in that third chamber.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
But when I was there, it
was ornately decorated.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It was very beautiful
with all kinds

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.690 align:middle line:90%
of hieroglyphs and statues.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.930 align:middle line:84%
There were actually
carved statues down there.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:84%
We went through
this hallway, and we

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:90%
went into this huge room.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.040 align:middle line:90%
And it was filled with gold.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was spectacular.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.250 align:middle line:84%
It was huge, high ceilings,
and there were statues

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:90%
of all the Egyptian gods.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
There was gold and
vases and statues,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:84%
all these things
filling the room.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.610 align:middle line:10%
And there were papyrus
rolls, all kinds

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:10%
of rolls of papyrus
that had ancient text.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And they told me it was the
ancient text of Atlantis

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and that this was the library
that's underneath the Sphinx.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we went up a shaft,
climbing up the ladder.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up in
the cavern that's

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
at the base in the back of
the Sphinx, underground.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything is reflected above
ground that is underground.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason the
pyramids were built

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
is to reflect that there is,
in fact, pyramids underground.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
The second chamber is the seven
sarcophagi and the seven deaths

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.190 align:middle line:90%
that you go through.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The third chamber is the
chamber of the initiates.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:90%
It's down further.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Then we have the fourth chamber.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the great
hall, the library.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the
fifth chamber, which

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.460 align:middle line:84%
is the first cavern
under the Sphinx.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.400 align:middle line:90%
The sixth is the second cavern.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And the seventh is the
pyramid that's underground.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Could there really be seven
levels underneath the Osiris

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.235 align:middle line:90%
Shaft and the Sphinx?

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:10%
>> In July 1911, archaeologist
George Reisner launched

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:10%
excavations and spoke
about them to the press.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:10%
He was very reputable
and had been working

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:10%
on the Giza Plateau for years.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to focus on and
dig around the Sphinx.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
In March of the
following year, 1912,

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
he claimed to have
discovered a hole

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:11.600 align:middle line:84%
in the Sphinx's head, a
passage which he went through.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.780 align:middle line:84%
He always communicated
via the American press

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and used them to announce that
the passages went much further

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:90%
away and may harbor treasure.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:84%
March of the following year
is when the story really

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:90%
takes off.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:84%
In March 1913, several magazines
covered Reisner's discoveries,

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.360 align:middle line:84%
explaining that he went
much deeper into the Sphinx

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and discovered a millennia-old
city buried underground

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and a solar temple that was
at least 6,000 years old.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.770 align:middle line:10%
This temple was said to have the
link to the Temple of Solomon.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
It was extraordinary,
and many magazines

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.850 align:middle line:84%
spoke of his
discoveries in 1913.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.340 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
that Reisner spoke

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:84%
of an underground city
beneath the Giza Plateau,

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.895 align:middle line:84%
of a buried solar temple,
even of small pyramids.

00:23:04.895 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Reisner wasn't the only
one to publish such work.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:10%
A journalist, Paul White,
published an expedition

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:10%
that happened in 1978 on the
Giza Plateau using SIRA radar.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Chambers were found, and
a crew with a film camera

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:90%
explored its depths.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
White explains that the
film was shown in Australia

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.260 align:middle line:84%
to a few people
and featured what

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.020 align:middle line:84%
looked to be complete
with hydraulic underground

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.070 align:middle line:84%
waterways, massive chambers,
and a large cathedral

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.690 align:middle line:90%
with enormous statues.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:84%
The video, however, has
since been suppressed.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
If this is true that
buried cities, passageways,

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and possibly
pyramids and temples

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:84%
existed below the surface of the
Sphinx, what was their purpose?

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible these
discoveries are

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:84%
just the beginning of
something even more mysterious?

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:10%
>> So, basically, the picture
of how this works is like

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.710 align:middle line:10%
the place where a computer
stores information.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like this green
with the copper

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:90%
and gold and these shiny dots.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Basically the pyramids
are like those shiny dots,

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and all the grid around through
where the information goes

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:90%
through is the water below.

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So, basically, the water
below and all the chambers

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%
below the pyramids
and the temples,

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
they are the ones
sharing the information,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
bringing the information,
channeling the information.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramids are
like the computers

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.300 align:middle line:90%
that spread that information.

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:84%
This is why every
pyramid is connected

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.220 align:middle line:90%
to the grid in the underground.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And as you have shaft
for the water below,

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:06.230 align:middle line:84%
you have shafts in the
chambers above to connect

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
with the invisible
links in the sky,

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.080 align:middle line:84%
which is the connection
with the stars.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.780 align:middle line:90%
That would be the ether.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So water and ether would
be the two different ways

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.550 align:middle line:84%
of information that are stored
in the center of the pyramid

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:90%
so you could create the grid.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:90%
So they work together.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like a whole
system, like a computer.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:84%
From Giza Plateau, they started
to build the whole network,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
not only in the
invisible connection

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
through the atmosphere
and to the magnetic field,

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:90%
but also in the underground.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So they started to build
this whole big network

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:84%
in the underground with tunnels
that go from here to Israel,

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:90%
from there to Iraq to Turkey.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And from Turkey, which is the
head of the snake, the most

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
important place from where all
the energy spreads physically

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:84%
around the world, they started
to create all this grid

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.270 align:middle line:90%
towards Europe and India.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So, for sure, all the
tunnels that some people know

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.770 align:middle line:84%
in Romania and some
other parts of Europe,

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
they're all linked and
connected because it

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:90%
was all a great grid.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.530 align:middle line:90%


00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Could there be a massive
underground grid that spans

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:90%
across Egypt, India, and Europe?

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
It just so happens that, in the
Bucegi Mountains of Romania,

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:84%
there is what is referred
to as the Romanian Sphinx.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:84%
This monument faces
north, and legends

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:84%
of tunnels that hold evidence
of a different kind of Hall

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:84%
of Records have been
told here for decades.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Elders from this
region have talked

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:84%
about three tunnels, one
that goes to inner Earth,

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.810 align:middle line:84%
another that goes to
Tibet, and the third that

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:90%
goes all the way to Giza.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the connection
to the Giza Plateau?

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, who or
what might have built this?

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.015 align:middle line:84%
Anton Parks returns back to
the Sumerian and Edfu texts

00:27:33.015 --> 00:27:33.815 align:middle line:90%

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:10%
>> I am specialized in Sumer
and have translated texts that

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:10%
speak of an ancient war
between the Anunna, the Nungal,

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.400 align:middle line:10%
and beings from space.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:84%
The Anunna gods came
to Earth in the midst

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.370 align:middle line:84%
of a war against beings
from the universe.

00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Tablet AO4153 says
the exact same thing,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunna gods came to
Earth and were unable to leave.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:90%
They were blocked here.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
When you start digging in the
Egyptian and Sumerian texts,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.070 align:middle line:84%
both the Egyptian
and Sumerian gods

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:90%
were at war against other gods.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The war prevented
them from leaving.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.200 align:middle line:84%
The Urma, planner
gods whose mission

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
was to preserve life on Earth,
went to war against the Anunna

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.880 align:middle line:84%
when they came to Earth
as a belligerent force.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
The Urma, which means
great warriors in Sumerian,

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:84%
were lion-headed
extraterrestrials.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:84%
They can be
recognized in Sekhmet,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:84%
the lion-headed goddess, who
is the warrior form of Hathor.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:84%
The famous lion-headed
Sphinx could also

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:84%
be related to the Urma, who,
according to my research,

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.580 align:middle line:90%
lived on the Giza Plateau.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They lived there in
underground bases.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I think they themselves
built gigantic infrastructure

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:90%
in which to live.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:84%
They left when the
Anunna arrived and handed

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.970 align:middle line:84%
over the Giza Plateau
to Osiris' clan, which

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.920 align:middle line:90%
is why they settled there.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:84%
I noticed the potential
presence of the Urma

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.820 align:middle line:90%
in the Edfu text 329330.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.820 align:middle line:10%
It describes a battle
against Set during which

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.670 align:middle line:10%
he attacks Atlantis yet again.

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Among those helping
Osiris battle

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Set's forces are
lion-headed warriors.

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to see a
potential trace of the Urma

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.845 align:middle line:90%
in the Edfu text.

00:29:35.845 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:90%

in shaping that society.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And when Atlantis fell, Sekhmet
is the only one that remained.

The rest of them went
back to their home,

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and Sekhmet stayed
because she was

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:84%
so dedicated to her
magicians, to her offspring.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And the Egyptian
gods adopted her

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and made her a part
of their group.

Urma can, to a certain extent,

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:84%
be recognized in Sekhmet, the
warrior counterpart of Hathor,

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:84%
the goddess of love connected
to Osiris' sister wives,

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Isis and Nephthys.

Hathor's warrior
form is Sekhmet.

She is also connected
to the Great Flood.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:84%
It is absolutely possible

>> Cats are one of the oldest
animistic symbols in the world.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:84%
There are many tribal
peoples in Africa

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.710 align:middle line:84%
that still have cults
surrounding shapeshifting

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:04.730 align:middle line:84%
beings that can transform
from a cat into a human

and back into a cat again.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And very clearly, Egypt itself,
which is in Northeast Africa,

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.220 align:middle line:84%
was also very much influenced
by these African traditions.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And it is for this
reason that there

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:25.870 align:middle line:84%
are a large number of
goddesses, in particular,

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:84%

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And what was the purpose of the
underground structure at Giza?

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the purpose of
the underground Urma base was

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to hide great numbers
of warriors and vessels.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:02.680 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerian and
Egyptian texts explain

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that the gods used flying
ships or fire ships.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.270 align:middle line:84%
They needed a place to
hide them and did so

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.510 align:middle line:84%
in the numerous caves
of the Giza Plateau

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:84%
as well as in the mountains,
where ships are believed

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:90%
to have landed, and the desert.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The goal was to hide
as much equipment

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:90%
and as many people as possible.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
According to my research,
the Giza Plateau

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.290 align:middle line:84%
is made up of
approximately seven levels.

00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:36.130 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian funerary
texts give the same number.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:84%
For example, an
engraving at Karnak

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.520 align:middle line:84%
shows a door divided
into seven parts that

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.120 align:middle line:84%
would symbolize the different
levels of the underground kigal

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:46.985 align:middle line:90%
of the Giza Plateau.

00:32:46.985 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:90%


00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.710 align:middle line:84%
According to my research
in certain excerpts

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:84%
of the funerary texts, the
first level is for prisoners.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
The gods lived in the
kigal, and the first level

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.780 align:middle line:90%
was for prisoners.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.700 align:middle line:84%
People of the court also
lived on this level.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:10%
Some ships were
probably there, as well.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:13.650 align:middle line:84%
The second level housed
gardens in the god's flock.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Some parts bathed in the
underground Nile, which

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:84%
is regularly mentioned
in funerary texts,

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.440 align:middle line:90%
such as that of the Ambda Reed.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:84%
This portion of the
Nile runs underground,

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.800 align:middle line:84%
parallel to the main
river from the delta

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:90%
until Oshawa, at least.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.530 align:middle line:90%
It's huge and very long.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.280 align:middle line:84%
From the north to Oshawa it
is said to be full of caves.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:90%


00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:10%
The third level housed
the hybrids, Egyptian gods

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:10%
coupled with humans.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.980 align:middle line:10%
And this level was dedicated
to their offspring, the hybrids

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.860 align:middle line:10%
that were half god, half human.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.190 align:middle line:10%
Humans may also
have lived there.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:00.250 align:middle line:84%
The fourth housed the
Egyptian god royalty.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:04.690 align:middle line:10%
The entire royal court
lived on the fourth level.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:10%
There is something important
to remember about the seven

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:10%
levels of the kigal.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.670 align:middle line:84%
They weren't organized like
the floors of a building.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.739 align:middle line:90%
Some levels intermingled.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Some bathed in the
underground Nile.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.159 align:middle line:10%
They are not organized
homogeneously and cannot be

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.310 align:middle line:10%
compared to those of a building.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:90%
The underground was huge.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:84%
The caves were originally
sculpted by water

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.310 align:middle line:84%
from the Mediterranean, which
engulfed Egypt and the plateau

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:90%
on several occasions.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
The technology that allowed
all the levels to breathe

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.050 align:middle line:84%
was on the fifth
level of the kigal.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:84%
There must have been a
technology that created

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:90%
an artificial atmosphere.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.540 align:middle line:84%
The deeper you go
into Earth, the harder

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:51.940 align:middle line:90%
it becomes to breathe.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Engineers in charge of running
the system also lived there.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.570 align:middle line:90%


00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.360 align:middle line:10%
The sixth level housed
the arsenal and probably

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.860 align:middle line:10%
the gods' vessels.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:84%
The last level, the
seventh, was not very big

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.530 align:middle line:90%
and housed the power generator.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It supplied the different levels
with all the power they needed.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the
artificial atmosphere,

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:20.790 align:middle line:84%
there was light streaming in
from the ceiling of each level.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.510 align:middle line:84%
The generator on the sixth level
allowed the simulation of a sky

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.350 align:middle line:90%
on each level.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:90%

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.340 align:middle line:84%
have left behind traps and
sealed certain structures.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:84%
There might also be
pockets of gas, which would

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.850 align:middle line:90%
seem likely the deeper you go.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So much could be
found if we were

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.930 align:middle line:90%
allowed to explore the site.

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.360 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's very
clear that there

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.760 align:middle line:84%
must be monumental
infrastructure

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
with tremendous stones
like those of the Osirion.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There might also be
unknown equipment

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial origin.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.530 align:middle line:84%
This is what could
probably be found.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that below
the Giza Plateau is an ancient

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:41.890 align:middle line:84%
military base with
unfathomable technology created

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:46.360 align:middle line:84%
by a forgotten race whose face
seems to grace our presence

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:84%
in the form of the Sphinx,
reminding us daily that below

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:84%
its feet lies not only
the secrets of Atlantis

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.150 align:middle line:84%
but the origins of
the universe itself?

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:84%
With so many entrances
to this labyrinth,

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.400 align:middle line:84%
will we ever be
able to dig deeper?

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Will we ever be able to
go beyond the first level

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.560 align:middle line:90%
of the Tomb of the Birds?

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And will the tomb of Osiris
ever be explored enough

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.700 align:middle line:90%
to reach the Sphinx?

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Only time will tell
when a piece of our past

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.710 align:middle line:84%
will reveal itself and
invite us into its womb,

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:30.370 align:middle line:84%
into the Earth, where history
keeps all her secrets.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:40.363 align:middle line:90%
