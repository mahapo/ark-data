>> The recent discovery of
megalithic blocks submerged off

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:10%
the coast of Japan further
suggests that there was

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:10%
an extensive complex of
civilization that existed

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:10%
before the deluge,
before the flood,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:10%
before the sea levels rose to
the level that they are today.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And if that is
the case, it means

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
we're talking Ice
Age civilizations,

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
a time that traditional history
is reluctant to acknowledge,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and a civilization that
traditional historians are

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:90%
reluctant to acknowledge.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
The evidence, up until recently,
has been called anomalous.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So when discoveries are made,
such as the Gulf of Khambhat

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:84%
or the megalithic blocks
off the coast of Japan,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
when they are found and they
don't fit into the story,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
they're put into a pile
that is called an anomaly.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And they say we'll come
back and study them later.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
What's happening right
now is that the anomalies

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
are so great that they're
telling their own story.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Japan is a big part of this.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
The stones that we see submerged
off the coast of Japan,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
the precision of the way
these stones were created,

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.430 align:middle line:84%
is reminiscent of what we
see in places like Tiahuanaco

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and even the Giza
Plateau in Egypt.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.770 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about the
smoothness, just the way

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
it is inside the Great
Pyramid, over a 20-foot area

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
less than 1/1000 of
an inch deviance,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:84%
that is a sign of
remarkable workmanship

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and of craftsmanship using
tools that we have today.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Where did those kinds
of tools come from?

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And how did the people
in the Pleistocene

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:90%
create something like that?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And if these stone
blocks date to the age

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that the evidence suggests,
this is precisely what

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
That there was the
technologically advanced

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.060 align:middle line:84%
civilization just off
the coast of Japan

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:90%
when the sea levels were lower.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And when those sea levels
rose at the end of the Younger

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.110 align:middle line:90%
Dryas, the city was inundated.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think we owe
it to ourselves

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
these cities are,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
who the people were, what
it means to us in our past

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
to help us understand our
relationship to the world

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:90%
today and even our future.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Whenever you go around
Japan you get the sense that

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:10%
something much older is going
on than is publicly accepted.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is look at
the foundation of, for example,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:84%
the Imperial Palace or
the major temple in Osaka.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And even if you go a little
bit further south of Japan

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:84%
underwater, the steps
that form this platform

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
called Yonaguni,
which actually happen

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
to mark the exact position
of the Tropic of Cancer,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:90%
where it was back in 12,000 BC.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it's been
submerged since then.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:10%
>> In the Kansai region roughly
in the center of the main

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.740 align:middle line:10%
island of Japan, Osaka Castle
is a site built of massive

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:10%
polygonal, cyclopean blocks
that resemble similar stones

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:10%
in Peru, Bolivia, and Egypt.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The massive platform, which
was built long before,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.350 align:middle line:84%
serves as the foundation
for the castle,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:84%
resembling the ancient
platforms on Easter Island

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and in Tiahuanaco
leaving more clues

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.860 align:middle line:84%
around the possible
pre-diluvian link

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
between Japan and the
ancient Mu empire.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So the fact, is we're
finding this polygonal,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
cyclopean style in Japan, just
like we find partly on Easter

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Island, in Peru and
Bolivia, in ancient Egypt,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:90%
and many other places.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:90%
So what is going on here?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Is this proof of an advanced
ancient civilization

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:90%
on a global scale?

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:10%
One of the most interesting
sites in Japan to me

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.255 align:middle line:10%
is Osaka Castle.

00:06:00.255 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:10%
Now this is one of
these sites that

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:10%
has these massive cyclopean
blocks, precision-carved,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:10%
and polygonal masonry
involved with it as well.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.665 align:middle line:84%
One of the stones weighs up
to something like 800 tons.

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:16.193 align:middle line:84%
They're absolutely
huge some of them.

00:06:16.193 --> 00:06:17.610 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
about Osaka Castle

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:84%
there's extreme
weathering and kind

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
of damage of many of the stones
suggesting it is actually

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:84%
much older than when the castle
was claimed to have been built.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Now this is intriguing because
polygonal style, the kind

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
of cyclopean construction where
the jigsaw stones are placed

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
together, has been proved to
work really well in earthquake

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.510 align:middle line:84%
zones where they just don't fall
down when earthquakes occur.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And we know this area
is an earthquake zone.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And so, potentially, it
could have been standing

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:90%
for like thousands of years.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:84%
You know and can
we also speculate

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that there's some other strange
features on the stones that

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.090 align:middle line:84%
appear to be vitrification
like they've been superheated

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:90%
by some kind of cataclysm.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, could they be
even 12,000 years old?

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Could they have been witness
to the Younger Dryas impact

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
event that decimated the
planet this long ago?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that you
find in Japanese architecture

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:10%
are these megalithic
constructions.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:10%
Now one of the things
that I find fascinating

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.350 align:middle line:10%
is that when you look at some
of what I consider the oldest

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:10%
construction is you have
these bizarre shaped stones,

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:10%
and all of them have
very beveled edges.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:10%
And you find that same
kind of architecture

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:10%
in South America, in Machu
Picchu, in Sacsayhuaman.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
You find it on Easter Island,
in the Imperial Palace in Japan.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just a
very consistent style.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Where if you look at what I
consider later construction,

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:84%
instead of having these
beveled edges and very tight

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:84%
fitting stones, we still
have odd shaped stones,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.532 align:middle line:84%
but they're not as
well placed together.

00:08:03.532 --> 00:08:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that's

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
very consistent about all
megalithic construction is

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.210 align:middle line:90%
that it's very tight fitting.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:90%
It is clean and exact.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you move forward in
time, the level of workmanship

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and the quality
of the workmanship

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:90%
really disintegrates.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:10%
>> The culture that is most
strongly associated with these

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:10%
incredible megalithic stone
blocks found in Japan is that

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:10%
of the Jomon.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Now who exactly are these?

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Well they would seem to have
started out as hunter gatherers

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.410 align:middle line:90%
as much as 16,000 years ago.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But they would seem by
about 12,000 years ago

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:84%
to have created the earliest
pottery, some of which

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
has been found in
the caves of Japan.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:84%
This is very distinctive and it
shows that they, by this time,

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
had reached a certain
stage of development.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
They go on to be high culture
that exists across Japan

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:90%
through to around 400 BC.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:90%
And then they disappear.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.990 align:middle line:84%
They just vanish basically
around the same time

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:28.570 align:middle line:84%
that we know Japan with its
whole institution of emperors

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.400 align:middle line:90%
begins to rise up.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And quite clearly
they almost certainly

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
have some kind of
basis in the fact

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
that the Jomon were
there in the past.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And out of their ashes, almost
like the rising phoenix,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:84%
comes the whole institution
of the emperors of Japan.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> There are several mysterious
stone structures and carvings

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
found in South America that
resemble masonry styles

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.910 align:middle line:90%
in Japan.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
A lesser known site around Lake
Titicaca is named Amaru Muru.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:84%
The function of this
site is highly debated,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
but the flattened mountain
and precise carvings

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
hold very interesting
ties to the pillar shape

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
from Gobekli Tepe in
the Fertile Crescent.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And an awe-inspiring megalith
in the Kansai region of Japan.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Ishi No Hoden, or the
Stone of the Heirloom,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:10%
is one of the most
interesting sites in Japan.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.910 align:middle line:10%
It's located in the
center of the country.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:10%
So it could be like
an omphalos stone.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It could have marked the
sacred center of ancient Japan.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:90%
It's got this very odd design.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like part
of a huge machine.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like a cube with a
pointed end on one side.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And so who created
this, we don't know,

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and how they could
have actually carved

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
such a beautiful
piece of stone art.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Ishi no Hoden, which is a
massive cyclopean stone that

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.360 align:middle line:84%
weighs 500 tons, something
like 15 feet tall on each side

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:90%
and 15 feet deep.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.510 align:middle line:10%
The stone cube that's referred
to as a floating ship.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:10%
It's called a floating
ship because it literally

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.930 align:middle line:10%
appears to float on water.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The water actually gushes
up from underneath the earth

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.150 align:middle line:90%
in a continuous stream.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I think Floating Rock in
Japan is an extraordinary

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:10%
megalith.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:84%
It's associated
with ground water.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
That's rainwater that fell
from the sky, often coined

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
yang water.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's also associated
with the female water

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:90%
called yin water.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So you've got groundwater
feeding the pond

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
making it look like
it floats, plus

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
you have sea water
feeding into that as well,

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:90%
it has been suggested.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.090 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a rock placed
on all of that kind of energy

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
to do with water like
geographic stress, like energy,

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.640 align:middle line:84%
it can rise up the ground
about 30 or 40 feet

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.390 align:middle line:84%
imbuing the site
with healing energy.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why it became
associated with healing

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:90%
ailments and diseases.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But whether that
was its first use,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't think so because it's
such a strange shaped monolith.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:10%
>> It sort of suggests that
it has something to do with

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:10%
the metaphoric idea
of rejuvenation,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:10%
the spring of life from
where everything comes from.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.140 align:middle line:10%
And the story goes the
gods when they first

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.880 align:middle line:10%
arrived in Japan, they got there
by the assistance of sky rock

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:10%
boats.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:10%
And Ishi no Hoden
is also said to be

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:10%
one of the representation
of these boats of the gods

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:10%
that used to fly from
the Korean Peninsula

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:10%
all the way to Japan when it
was still attached to the Korean

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:10%
Peninsula.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
entire structure,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
it's been hollowed
out like a big bowl.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like the bowl
is it's collecting something.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty obvious
that it's drawing

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
in the power of some star
or something on the horizon.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.960 align:middle line:90%
A date?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, the best
example that I've been

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:84%
able to come up with
so far is that exactly

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:84%
on the winter
solstice of 8600 BC,

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:84%
the sun rises exactly
facing that stone, which

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.800 align:middle line:84%
is a very momentous occasion
because it is exactly

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
the same moment around
the face of the earth

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.720 align:middle line:84%
where humans suddenly,
mysteriously,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:84%
discovered civilization
thanks to a group of gods

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that show up in
groups of seven led

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.700 align:middle line:84%
by a charismatic leader
at strategic locations

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So the dating of the
alignment of the stone

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
relative to
archeological discoveries

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
of the sudden discovery of
civilization around the world

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
actually matches and overlaps
mythology at the same time.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:10%
>> It seems to have no obvious
function other than it looks

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:10%
like it should have formed
a piece of architecture that

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:10%
simply doesn't exist.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And the importance
about these stones

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and several others in
Japan is that they are

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.650 align:middle line:90%
many thousands of years old.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:10%
They are clearly not
part of any tradition

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:10%
that we can associate
with Japan over,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:10%
let's say, the last
2,000 to 3,000 years

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:10%
of recorded history.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Southeast of Ishi no Hoden
the landscape holds several

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:84%
stone relics that deepen the
pre-diluvian mystery in Japan.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>> In Japan there's a
village named Asuka.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And in this village,
there are literally

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:84%
dozens of super
megalithic stones.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.210 align:middle line:10%
But not just any
megalithic stones,

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:10%
these stones are cut
with advanced technology.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:84%
There's even evidence of tool
marks on some of these stones.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And these stones are interesting
because they actually

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:84%
resemble similar stones
in Pumapunku half way

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:84%
around the world
on a mountaintop.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The inlays, the
cuts, the smoothness

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:84%
of some of the interior
of some of these cuts,

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
it really matches the
same cuts at Pumapunku.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other amazing
pieces of stone work in Japan

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:90%
is near Asuka.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Now this is what's
called the Rock Ship.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strange, anomalous,
artistic, almost abstract piece

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.650 align:middle line:90%
of stone art.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a multi-ton block.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's got grooves
carved out of it.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
It almost looks like some
kind of spaceship or UFO

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:90%
has kind of landed there.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And so this is another one of
these obscure pieces of stone

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:90%
art that we find in Japan.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And, again, no one
knows who put it there.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.670 align:middle line:90%
No one knows who carved it.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:43.122 align:middle line:84%
And yet it shows extremely
high levels of sophistication.

00:15:43.122 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
question who actually

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:84%
built these amazing sites
that we find in Japan?

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a monolith that is
perhaps 500 tons in weight.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's been carved
out in such a way as

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to look, quite literally, almost
like a sort of crashed UFO

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.390 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the only
way to describe it.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.260 align:middle line:10%
And the type of
machining that seems

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:10%
to have gone on to
create its bizarre shape

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.415 align:middle line:10%
is something which
is unnecessary.

00:16:20.415 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:10%
Unnecessary from
the point of view

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:10%
that we have no
idea why they would

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:10%
have created a
monolith like this

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:10%
and just left it on what is
today the edge of a forest.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
that this particular stone

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:90%
has a legend about it.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that one of the
celestial beings that founded

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese
culture was actually

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:84%
flying through the air in
a vehicle, a Rock Ship,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and that it did actually
crash, and that this

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:90%
was the result of that.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Now that celestial
being in question

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
is a part of mythology
in Japan, and it's

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.239 align:middle line:84%
become associated with
this particular monolith.

00:17:09.239 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the legendary tales of
gods flying through the air be

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
connecting this ancient culture
to India where similar Vimana

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
craft were depicted
in the Mahabharata?

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:10%
Were these ancient
stone masons trying

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:10%
to recreate what they
observed in the ancient sky

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:10%
around the same time as the
epic battles in the Mahabharata?

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
What other clues point
alternative researchers

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to look deeper into the
spiritual texts and traditions

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
from Japan to answer questions
about their ancient connection

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.770 align:middle line:90%
to the stars?

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:10%
>> According to the
Japanese traditions,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:10%
the Shinto traditions of Japan,
people have been present there

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:10%
since the very beginning
of Japan when it was first

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:10%
manifested.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:84%
They have the idea in
their origins accounts

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:14.390 align:middle line:84%
that there were
higher beings, gods,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
who manifested the
Japanese islands.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
They were on a bridge that
led from the heavens to Earth.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And they dipped a spear
into the ocean waters,

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and some salt
crystals crystallized

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:90%
from the tip of the spear.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And those formed the
eight principal islands

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
of Japan, which were
populated by these gods

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:90%
with human beings.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.880 align:middle line:84%
And then they decided
the human beings on Earth

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:90%
should have an emperor.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:10%
So a descendant
of the sun goddess

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.020 align:middle line:10%
became the first emperor.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
Japanese Shinto traditions,

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
the islands of Japan
have been inhabited

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
by civilized human beings
from the very beginning

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.970 align:middle line:90%
of those islands.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So Shinto is one of the
most fascinating religions

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the earth.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.045 align:middle line:90%
It means the way of the gods.

00:19:23.045 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And that that
phrase alone places

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
the original understanding of it
and when it appeared in Japan.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So at the time of
creation of Japan

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
when the Japan rises out
of the waters of chaos

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
and you have the gods
Izanami and Izanagi,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:84%
they bring in what's
called 17 ways.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Each of these ways
is a sacred esoteric

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.640 align:middle line:84%
teaching how to perfect yourself
in this particular lifetime.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's from this
many thousands of years

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:90%
later that Shinto is born.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing is
that these 17 ways are found

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.950 align:middle line:90%
in other parts of the world.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And they have exactly
the same point of origin.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're attributed
to the same people.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:10%
So for example, in Peru,
which also features

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.920 align:middle line:10%
some of the exact same rock
carvings as they find in Japan,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:10%
you'll find around this
little temple called Qenqo,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:10%
on the outskirts of the city
of Cusco, the 17 alcoves.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:10%
Each one had one of the 17
ways or teachings of the gods.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So it puts Shinto into the
same tradition and point

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:84%
of origin as a time
when the gods suddenly

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
reappear on the
face of the earth,

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and they're teaching humans the
accouterments of civilization.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And the accouterments really
go down to the laws of civics,

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:84%
civilization, well-being,
how to show respect

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
for others, megalithic
temple building, and all

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the other things
that we seem to find

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
are the foundations for
leading a very orderly life.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's very interesting
that Japan is perhaps the only

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.570 align:middle line:84%
civilization that their origins
come from the sun goddess.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Amaterasu.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And this tells us
that, one, they

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.110 align:middle line:84%
believed in
extraterrestrial beings,

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.490 align:middle line:84%
that they're
ultimately descended

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:90%
from extraterrestrials.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
All of the Japanese emperors
up until World War II believed

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that they were incarnations
of the sun god and goddess,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that they were literally
incarnations of this divine

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:12.710 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And they had this divine
right to rule as emperors.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It was the General MacArthur
after the Japanese surrender

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that told the Japanese emperors
that they would no longer be

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:90%
able to make that claim.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And even to this day now,
the Japanese emperors

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:84%
are not allowed
to speak in public

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.610 align:middle line:84%
about their ultimate connection
to these divine beings.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these
gods and goddesses,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.040 align:middle line:84%
known as the kami in
the Shinto traditions,

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:84%
be the same group of gods that
influenced ancient cultures

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:84%
around the planet leading
to the royal bloodlines?

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Or were they connected
to the other groups

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of pre-diluvian
gods and goddesses

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
that appeared nearly
38,000 years ago

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.880 align:middle line:90%
around the time of Zep Tepi?

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
Were these wise ones
connected to the Shemsu Hor

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Egypt, the Anunna
from the Fertile Crescent,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.915 align:middle line:84%
or the ancient beings
depicted on Easter Island?

00:22:08.915 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
A discovery in the 1930s
deepened the mystery

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:84%
around the true
history of Japan.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Kiyomaro
Takeuchi, the youngest

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
in a long line of
Shinto priests,

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
discovered a set of documents
in his family library.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:10%
These documents
further confirmed

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:10%
a unique lineage of
the Japanese people

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:39.570 align:middle line:10%
and the mixing of human DNA long
before the great cataclysms.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The Takeuchi documents
supposedly go back many,

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
many thousands of years and
were preserved by the Imperial

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:84%
ancestral shrine along
with a number of treasures

00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.570 align:middle line:84%
by the Takeuchi family after
they were given to them to be

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
preserved at a time
of unrest in Japan.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And it is claimed that
they contain the foundation

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.130 align:middle line:84%
point, not only
of the human race,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
but also of the cosmos,
the universe, the world,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
how everything came
into being and how

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
there were countless
generations until the rise

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
of the first Japanese
Emperor Jimmu who reigned

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:90%
in around 500 to 600 BC.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
The Takeuchi documents claim
that before Emperor Jimmu

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
reigned, there were
73 other emperors

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:90%
from the so-called Divine Era.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
were almost like demigods

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that had ruled right the way
through to the prehistoric age.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But before then, it is suggested
that the very first emperor was

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:84%
the result of a divine
union between the sun

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.700 align:middle line:90%
goddess and a mortal being.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
the emperors truly believed,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that they were descended
from this celestial being

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:84%
that had come down
from the stars itself.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Can these documents be
compared to the Sumerian Kings

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:37.650 align:middle line:10%
List in the Fertile Crescent
and the Turin papyrus in Egypt,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:10%
serving as evidence of an
advanced group of wise ones

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:10%
that were on the earth long
before Homo sapien sapiens

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:10%
became the dominant species?

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:53.350 align:middle line:84%
As with most mythology, the
tales get taller as they age.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
But the stone relics on
this mysterious island chain

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.870 align:middle line:84%
point to a much stronger
foundational connection

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:90%
to the Mu civilization.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Japan feels different because
Atlantean civilization never

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.160 align:middle line:90%
got to the island.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:90%
This is the Mu territory.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And Japan was one
of the main paths

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.440 align:middle line:84%
that they had to go
to the Gobi Desert.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So they used this island
as a place of connection.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And as you see, the shape of
the island is also the dragon.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So it was like the
holy land for them

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
where they would prepare the
people to have all the wisdom

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.540 align:middle line:90%
before they left.

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Like in South America, we
had Machu Picchu as a school

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.990 align:middle line:84%
because it was the
important place there.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So for the Mu in
Asia, it was Japan.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> As the submerged Yonaguni
Monument gives us a clue

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.380 align:middle line:84%
to the presence of the
Mu empire in Japan,

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
the archeological connections
to other sites on lands that

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
surround the mighty Pacific
Ocean are hard to deny.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Huge tombs, unique
structures, castle walls

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.480 align:middle line:84%
that date back to 12,000
years, and stone carvings

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:90%
resembling flying craft--

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:84%
do these ancient
artifacts in Japan

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:84%
not only represent a lost
civilization but also

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and concepts of a
world we can barely fathom?

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
A world preserved in the
documents and religion

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.660 align:middle line:84%
that have been banned
since World War II.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:84%
As the tales of gods and
goddesses throughout mythology

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:84%
have taught us, as we wind
down the road, the trials

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and tests that we must endure
as a species are not designed

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
to be easy, they are designed
to help us understand

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.370 align:middle line:84%
that we have the
power within to become

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:05.470 align:middle line:84%
these wise ones from which
fables are written around.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:84%
We, too, one day, will
become the ancient ancestors

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.100 align:middle line:90%
of Earth's inhabitants.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
When humanity
unites as a species,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:84%
we can return this
majestic planet

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
to a way of life
connected to the cosmos

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
like the gods and goddesses did
before the end of the world.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.520 align:middle line:90%
