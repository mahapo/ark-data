>> Historical legends from
around the planet speak of two

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:90%
great civilizations--

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Mu and Atlantis-- that rose
to prominence and power

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
and were completely destroyed
by catastrophes that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:90%
are beyond our comprehension.

Megalithic relics aligned
to the ancient sky

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%
provide evidence that these
civilizations harnessed

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:84%
a knowledge of the
cosmos, mathematics,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and architecture that
completely defies

modern human understanding.

Who taught these
great civilizations

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
how to manipulate matter and
bend the laws of gravity?

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.690 align:middle line:84%
How advanced did
their technology

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.030 align:middle line:90%
become before their world ended?

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
What happened to these
great civilizations?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:10%
When the Earth was drastically
changed between roughly 12,800

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.370 align:middle line:10%
and 11,600 years ago, in a
chaotic period of time named

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:10%
the Younger Dryas, blending
science with mythology

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:10%
provides a geological glimpse
into the ancient record, when

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:10%
the legends were born,
and the world abruptly

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.890 align:middle line:10%
ended for many species
on planet Earth.

of the Pacific Ocean
about a civilization

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that began roughly
50,000 years ago

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and understood the principles
of nature and the elements.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:10%
From the tales of the
great sun God, Maui,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:10%
to the mysterious past of

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:10%

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:10%
to the planet and the
stars, are scattered

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:10%
throughout this
legendary region,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.690 align:middle line:10%
providing clues to a
time when the empire we

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:10%
have come to know as Mu
was a thriving civilization

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:10%
in the Pacific.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Throughout history, there
have always been references

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:10%
to an ancient motherland,
a land that pre-existed,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:10%
long before civilization
as we know it today.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:10%
We find in the oral
traditions of the Indigenous

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:10%
peoples of the world,
memories and stories

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:10%
of this ancient land.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.180 align:middle line:84%
All the way from the Aboriginals
in Australia through the Andes

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
of Southern Peru, Bolivian
Altiplano, all the way

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
into Tibet and Nepal
and India, and all

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
through the American
desert Southwest and more.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
The story that is told from
this ancient continent of Mu

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
is the story that predates all
of the other civilizations.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Everybody has
heard about Atlantis.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:10%
This island continent in the
Atlantic Ocean, obviously.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:10%
But there is an equal version
of that in the Pacific Ocean,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:10%
and this is the island
continent of Mu.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are various cultures
that exist all over the Pacific

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that talk about the destruction
of this island continent.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Mu or Mu-u, as they tend
to call it for the Pacific

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:10%
and South America is
a fascinating story.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:10%
Because if you see the
story from multiple angles

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:10%
around the Pacific,
you begin to them

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:10%
a picture of what
it actually was.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
This country, this continent,
or series of islands

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:84%
was actually the center
of a civilization.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And we have evidence from
the people around the Pacific

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.368 align:middle line:84%
that talk about a time when
a great catastrophe inundated

00:04:44.368 --> 00:04:45.410 align:middle line:90%
the whole of the Pacific.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.660 align:middle line:84%
There were all kinds of
objects coming out of the sky,

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:90%
destroying their homeland.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:10%
>> There are a number of
cultures that talk about these

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:10%
events.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:10%
On Easter Island,
the natives claim

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:10%
that they came from a
sunken land that once

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:10%
had a very advanced culture.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:84%
In the Madrid Codex, it talks
about a land that was shaken up

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and fell beneath the waters
and was never seen again.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
It goes on to tell us that 64
million people died that day.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:10%
>> There are legends about
Mu, especially in the Pacific

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:10%
Northwest, the area around
Mount Shasta, for example,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:10%
has amazing stories about a
pre-flood civilization on Mu,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:10%
which was very near
the California coast.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
What they tell us
in these stories

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is that the California
coast originally

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
extended 2 to 5 miles out
from where it presently is.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And that having foreknowledge
of this impending cataclysm

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.760 align:middle line:84%
that there were survivors
that left and came over

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
to California and settled
in the area around

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.620 align:middle line:90%
and even within Mount Shasta.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Several relics from this
ancient civilization can be

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
found throughout
the mighty Pacific.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
From the mysterious megaliths
to the tribal cultures

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and practices
throughout, many agree

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient
civilization of Mu

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:90%
influenced countless cultures.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:90%
But the question remains--

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
where was this
legendary motherland?

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If you just look at
the Pacific from space,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
for example, and you compare
it to the rest of the Earth,

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.290 align:middle line:84%
there's this unmistakable
idea that there's a big piece

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:90%
of land missing.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like what
you're seeing today,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:84%
the little dots of the
islands around the Pacific

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
are the tops of the
mountains from where

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.430 align:middle line:90%
a land mass used to be.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And that certainly is
still in the memory

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of Pacific
Islanders today.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.350 align:middle line:10%
>> My personal belief is that
what we call Mu was ancient

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:10%
Hawaii.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.390 align:middle line:84%
If you looked at a
topographical map of Hawaii,

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and lower the sea level by
400 feet, all of the islands

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:90%
connect.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are conflicting
stories about Mu as a landmass.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And once you start piecing
these things together,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize
it was a concept.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Mu was an idea that
actually brought together

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.840 align:middle line:84%
many cultures and many
fragments together in what was

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:90%
essentially a group of islands.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So it was more like
an archipelago.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Various cultures say that
this is where they came from

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:90%
originally.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.930 align:middle line:84%
This is where their ancestors
came from many thousands

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:90%
of years earlier.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And this was said to have
been destroyed in a cataclysm.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The inundation is what
essentially made people escape

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
this landmass and start
spreading the colonization

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas
around the Pacific.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Evidence from Tibet sparked
alternative researchers

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.350 align:middle line:10%
to explore the validity and
power of this once thriving

00:07:54.350 --> 00:08:00.350 align:middle line:10%
civilization in the center of
the Pacific Ocean, known as Mu.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The story of Mu begins
in the 1900s with a British

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:10%
archaeologist named
Sir Marc Aurel Stein,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:10%
who was traveling through
Asia, and specifically Tibet,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:10%
when he met a Taoist monk.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
The Taoist monk
went on to tell him

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
this incredible story
about the set of caves

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:84%
high in the cliffs, known as
the caves of a thousand Buddhas.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
In this story, the
Taoist monk describes

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:84%
how they were doing
restoration work

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:90%
on a number of these caves.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And near cave number 16, they
discovered a hidden chamber

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:84%
that opened up to a library
that had not been seen

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:90%
by humans in over 800 years.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:84%
As Stein was going
through the library,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
he found pieces
of an ancient map

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that described the lost
civilizations of Mu

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:90%
and Atlantis.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
It also gave us descriptions
of this volatile time period,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
showing inland flooding
throughout North and South

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:84%
America, showing these
catastrophes that were ongoing

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth at the time.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And this map seems to give us
a snapshot into a lost time

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
period in history,
showing that the Mu

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
civilization in this
entire landmass that

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
had existed in the Pacific
was in the process of being

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.370 align:middle line:90%
destroyed.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.700 align:middle line:10%
And this map gives us
a window into the past

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.250 align:middle line:10%
to understand this
forgotten civilization

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:10%
and gives us the proof
that it truly existed.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
After Sir Marc Aurel Stein
obtained this ancient map

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.840 align:middle line:84%
from the Taoist monk, he
brought it back with him,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.180 align:middle line:84%
along with a number of
other ancient texts.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:10%
And that's when he got the
attention of another writer,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:10%
James Churchward.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most prolific
writers on Mu was James

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Churchward.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
What Churchward said was
that the survivors of Mu

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:84%
actually came onto the Asian
continent and are the Uyghurs,

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
the people that occupy what
is today the extreme West

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:84%
of China, much persecuted
people, as we know,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that they were actually
the final remnants

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.230 align:middle line:90%
of the inhabitants of Mu.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> James Churchward, really,
was the father of the evidence

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and the theories regarding
the civilization of Mu.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
story building off

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
of the discoveries in the Tao's
cave of this map really began.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.143 align:middle line:10%
Because it was when
James Churchward found

00:10:18.143 --> 00:10:20.060 align:middle line:10%
some of the evidence
that was being discovered

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:10%
outside of Mexico City by
a man named William Niven,

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:10%
who discovered over 100
andesite tablets that were

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.820 align:middle line:10%
very mysterious at the time.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
It was when James Churchward
got a hold of those rubbings,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:84%
of those tablets that the whole
story really came together.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Because according to James
Churchward in his book,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:84%
he describes how
the tablets gave

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:84%
the context of the descriptions
of the civilization of Mu.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the map gave the
location and the details

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:90%
of how it was destroyed.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Coupled together with the
map and this new information,

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
James Churchward formulated
this entire set of new theories

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that we now build off of
for the civilization of Mu

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and where it existed
and when it existed.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Geologists do acknowledge
that there was a land mass

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:84%
called Sundaland, an
ancient land mass precisely

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
in the location in the Pacific
where the ancient traditions

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:84%
say that this
motherland existed.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:84%
This land was exposed during a
time in geologic history, when

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
the temperatures are much
colder, during the ice ages.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Geologists actually
look at this land bridge

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
as the route for the
migration from people

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
from New Guinea, for example,
and New Zealand into Australia.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.660 align:middle line:84%
They were able to go
across these land bridges

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
because the water
levels were low.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.150 align:middle line:10%
According to Churchward,
there was a continent

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:10%
that stretched all the
way from what today we

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.880 align:middle line:10%
call the Hawaiian islands
down into Easter Island

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:10%
over into the Indonesian
islands to the West,

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.810 align:middle line:10%
if you can imagine
in the Pacific Ocean

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.070 align:middle line:10%
a massive continent of
that size in place of what

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:10%
we see is as water today.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.770 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1864, zoologist Philip
Sclater noticed the presence

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:10%
of lemur monkey fossils
near Madagascar,

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.310 align:middle line:10%
but not in Africa or Australia.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:10%
He questioned if there was a
land mass connecting Madagascar

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:10%
to India that once allowed
these monkeys to migrate

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:10%
further than we once thought.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:10%
This area became
referred to as Lemuria.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Throughout modern history,
Mu has, sometimes, gone

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:90%
by the name Lemuria.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.140 align:middle line:10%
In the early 1900s, Russian
occultist Helena Blavatsky

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:10%
studied throughout
the world and wrote

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:10%
about early human ancestors
named the Lemurians.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Though there are vast
differences between the lives

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:84%
of ancient humans and how our
modern civilization has been

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:90%
built, one thing is certain--

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:84%
divine wisdom comes in many
different disciplines, shapes,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:90%
and sizes.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:10%
>> So let's take a different
view at some of these things.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at some
alternate information

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.850 align:middle line:10%
as to the origin
of human history,

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:10%
a different point of view and
why we want to look to these,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:10%
let's say, channeled texts to
the information that they have.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we go back and look
at some of the ancient writings

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
that we still have today,
they are channeled texts

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:90%
in one form or another.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.350 align:middle line:84%
They were considered
sacred documents.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.070 align:middle line:10%
And when we look to the
works of Madame Blavatsky,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:10%
she tells us that the people
of Mu, Lemuria, Atlantis

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:10%
were guided by
higher level beings.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And this guidance
came in the form

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:84%
of telepathic
communication rather than

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:90%
verbal communication.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we find fascinating
is that the little pieces

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and parts that come
from the channel

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:84%
texts of the modern world
and the ancient world

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.640 align:middle line:84%
can be validated
and verified through

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:90%
archaeological evidence.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
missing pieces?

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.485 align:middle line:84%
What about the blanks
that we can't fill in?

00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where
we go to the channel

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
text that gets those little
pieces and parts that

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:90%
can be validated.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Then we explore
those texts and go,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.227 align:middle line:84%
oh, this may be the motivations
of how they did things.

00:14:14.227 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:90%
This may be why they did things.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:10%
This may be how they did things.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most popular
channelers in the 20th century

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:10%
was Edgar Cayce, also known
as "The Sleeping Prophet."

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:10%
Throughout the
early 1900s, Cayce

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:10%
performed over 14,000
psychic readings,

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:10%
speaking at length about
Earth's ancient history.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:10%
Then, in the early
1980s, L/L Research

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:10%
in Louisville,
Kentucky, conducted over

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:10%
100 channeling sessions with
a consciousness known as Ra.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:10%
Ra expressed a knowledge
and understanding

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:10%
of the universe and
our ancient past

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:10%
which drastically exceeds
modern scientific understanding.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.110 align:middle line:10%
These powerful
sessions were gathered

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:10%
into a five-book collection
named, "The Law of One."

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Now when Ra was speaking
through Carla Rueckert to tell

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:10%
us about Mu, they tell
us that the people of Mu,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.990 align:middle line:10%
at that time period,
around 50,000 years ago,

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:10%
they were still
somewhat primitive,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:10%
but they had advanced
spiritual distortions.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And these advanced
spiritual distortions

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
helped them to connect
to higher level beings

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that could teach them
about building with stone

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and how to create their
culture that they did.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:10%
And the culture
that they created

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.220 align:middle line:10%
was a helpful,
harmless civilization,

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:10%
as Ra calls it, that
survived for quite a while

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:10%
until it finally became
inundated where the land sank.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:10%
And the people fled
throughout the world

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:10%
to far off places, most notably
to South America and North

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:10%
America, the Polynesian
Islands, Melanesia, New Zealand,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:10%
these various places.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we find butt
up against the works of Madame

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Blavatsky who says
the exact same thing

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:90%
for the exact same time period.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The survivors of
Mu where did they go?

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:10%
That is probably a very big
question and theories abound.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
But what I sense
about these people

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:84%
through different
disciplines, so we

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
can look through the
discipline of archaeology

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:90%
through dating systems.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
We can look through the
disciplines of spiritualism

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
with Madame Blavatsky,
for instance.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can even
look at disciplines,

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:90%
like past life regression.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And if we combine
all of those together

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to find out some kind
of Holy history, then

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:84%
the latter suggests that
the survivors were not just

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:84%
to the locality of the islands
nearby which makes sense,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.090 align:middle line:84%
like the South islands
and Easter Island.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But they went much further
afield and colonized and sent

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:84%
their civilization and
their understanding

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
of their texts, their
mathematics and astronomy

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
to further afield, even
to the Western world.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So I don't see
the survivors just

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:90%
being in one part of the world.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.470 align:middle line:90%
They went everywhere.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>> As the legendary
myths remind us,

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
divine intervention has
helped many heroes throughout

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:90%
their journeys.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Along with the
tales of triumph are

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:84%
the legends of
absolute destruction,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:84%
when these powerful gods
out there, beyond the stars,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.650 align:middle line:90%
began fighting.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Sumerian text,
the "Enuma Elish," as well as

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:10%
several other sources,
refer to a previous planet

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:49.460 align:middle line:10%
in our solar system between Mars
and Jupiter that was destroyed

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:10%
and is now the asteroid belt.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Phaeton, Tiamat, and Maldek
are some of the names

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.640 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.710 align:middle line:10%
In 1976, the book, "The 12th
Planet," by Zecharia Sitchin

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:10%
was published.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.500 align:middle line:10%
In this polarizing book, he
refers to this exploded planet

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:10%
as Nibiru.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Sitchin's interpretation
of this exploding planet is

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:90%
it's very sci-fi.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It's very fanciful, in
some people's opinion.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
about it is

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:84%
the way he expands our
vision in terms of the way

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:90%
we look at these ancient myths.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
He puts it into
the celestial realm

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and puts it into flesh
and blood beings that are

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:90%
in conflict with one another.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
The asteroid belt
is plainly there.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a former planet
in our solar system.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And the Sumerian myth
in the "Enuma Elish,"

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to come to
terms with what happened

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and presenting a way
of looking at our past.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:10%
And Sitchin, when he
comes in, is looking at it

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:10%
from a technological
perspective.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not to say he's wrong.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not to say he's right.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just an interesting
way of looking at this.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We know, definitely,
in mythology that

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials were here.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:90%
This is not just an invention.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:10%
We know it because
they say it themselves.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:10%
They say their fathers, the
gods traveled to outer space.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
They mentioned
gigantic spaceships.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:90%
They mentioned wars.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:84%
They mentioned that
they went to Mars,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:90%
that they went to the moon.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:84%
They definitely
went to outer space.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:middle line:10%
This is all mentioned
in the old Mahabharata.

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Another source that we
need to reference to have

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:84%
an open-minded skepticism when
we look to the ancient world is

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Swaruu.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Swaruu of Erra claims to
be a Pleiadian being that

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:90%
is in orbit around the Earth.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Swaruu described Tiamat as a
mostly water-based planet that

00:19:54.110 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
was in orbit around between Mars
and Jupiter, thinking about 80%

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:90%
the size of Neptune.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking a very
large water-sized planet

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:84%
with an advanced civilization
on it-- advanced by our terms.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the time period,
where all of this was going

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:84%
on, 13,000-plus years ago, there
was a major conflict between

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:84%
humanoid species and
reptilian species.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:84%
The humanoid species were
aligned with something called

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.310 align:middle line:84%
the Galactic Federation,
and the reptilian

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.560 align:middle line:84%
had their Orion
Council, the Dracos,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.820 align:middle line:84%
were all fighting
with each other.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:84%
One of the pivotal points
that they were in conflict

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.030 align:middle line:90%
was around this planet Tiamat.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And as part of this war,
this continuing war,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:84%
this huge watery
planet was destroyed,

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
the result of which is
the asteroid belt that we

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.290 align:middle line:90%
know about today.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
This caused devastation
through our whole solar system,

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
including putting
Venus into a closer

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.093 align:middle line:84%
orbit towards the sun which
we find in ancient texts

00:20:56.093 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:84%
all over the place
telling us that Venus

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:90%
had a different position.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, it became this
fiery super hot planet

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:90%
where it is now.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And so this destruction, which
we can hardly fathom today,

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.630 align:middle line:90%
how do you destroy a planet?

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> In Greek mythology, Tiamat
was renamed as Phaeton,

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
the son of Helios, suffers
a similar destruction.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.130 align:middle line:84%
There's gods flying
around in chariots,

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:90%
crashing into the Earth.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a very similar
story that opens up

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:84%
the imagination to thinking
about flesh and blood

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.600 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial beings
or spiritual beings that

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.430 align:middle line:84%
are traveling in
some sort of chariots

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, some kind of
craft that are, somehow, still

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:90%
impacting the Earth.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:10%
And that is an explanation
of our origins.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.200 align:middle line:84%
When you read these
stories about Tiamat

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and interpret it as a possible
planetary conflict between two

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
rival cultures,
you wonder, well,

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.140 align:middle line:84%
how could it ultimately
get to that point?

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't there be a
group, a governing body,

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:84%
like a galactic federation
that could intervene to prevent

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:90%
such a terrible occurrence?

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
answer to that is it's

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:84%
somewhat disconcerting,
when you look at,

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:90%
even the flood myth on Earth.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The gods who dwell in heaven
and are part of a divine council

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:84%
that you could interpret
as a galactic federation

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
knew this cataclysm
that destroyed

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:84%
an ancient civilization
was going to happen,

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:90%
and they let it happen anyway.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
They, perhaps, couldn't
intervene or perhaps

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
weren't allowed to intervene
for whatever reason.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very,
very interesting

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.770 align:middle line:84%
to look at this idea of a divine
council or galactic federation

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and what their limits
might have been

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.490 align:middle line:84%
in terms of saving
a civilization

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:90%
or actually intervening.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The planet Earth
is hurt and was hurt.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.440 align:middle line:84%
We have hundreds of
thousands of craters.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of them may be
natural, but others not.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Might be the result
of a catastrophe.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Definitely in old holy
books, the few which exist,

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.040 align:middle line:90%
we have the war in heaven.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It is described the gods were
fighting against each other.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.820 align:middle line:90%
With atomic bombs, no way out.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:90%
So we have this description.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When combining
the myths, legends,

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:84%
and lore of the ancient
civilization of Mu,

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:84%
we discover the same
recurring theme--

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:84%
water was a powerful
element in the destruction

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.320 align:middle line:90%
of the motherland.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:84%
As scientists
search for evidence

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
about Earth's violent
history, there's

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
a powerful piece of the story
that remains unanswered.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the
scientific community,

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:84%
they are asking where
did the ice come from.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
They are asking this
question-- where did the water

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:90%
come from our planet?

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is a question where
the scientific community

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.880 align:middle line:90%
has no answer.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is believed to have
happened is that the sea levels

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:84%
rose very, very quickly from a
mysterious event that still is

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
not well understood
by modern science.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.290 align:middle line:84%
This mysterious event that
caused a tremendous rise

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:13.400 align:middle line:84%
in the sea levels rapidly
burying everything underwater,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
submerging everything
underwater.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:84%
In a way, that left
only remnants today.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And we see flat top remnants
of these mountaintops,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that if they were
above sea level

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.120 align:middle line:84%
would exceed anything that
we see above sea level today.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:84%
That's how deep the
water would have

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:84%
to be to cover this
mysterious continent.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:84%
From a geologic
perspective, there

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:84%
is resistance in
traditional geology

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that such a thing could happen
for a number of reasons.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
is the geology

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and the activity
around the geology

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:90%
is based upon computer models.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:10%
And the computer models show
that for this kind of event

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:10%
to happen, so much water would
have to be present so quickly

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:10%
in such a short period of time
and the upheavals that would be

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:10%
required on the sea floor to
allow this kind of submerging

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.670 align:middle line:10%
of an entire continent are
something that the models

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:10%
simply cannot account
for at this time.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Science holds that
there was never a flood,

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
but 12,800 years ago, there
was a major cosmic impact.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:27.000 align:middle line:84%
The object has many names,
one of which is Phaeton.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Phaeton impacted the Earth.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Its remnants are found
in the Southern Ocean,

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.690 align:middle line:90%
southeast of Madagascar.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Geologists know there
was a cosmic impact.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
You can see that there was
a very dense central core,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:90%
so you can see this scrape.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It's 1,000-mile long scrape
emanating from the center

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
of the impact to where the
central core came to rest.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.250 align:middle line:10%
And it is almost unimaginable.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:10%
It completely
changed the planet.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:58.980 align:middle line:10%
James Churchward, he has some
very interesting paintings

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:10%
on the destruction of the Mu.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.930 align:middle line:10%
In one of them, it
shows inhabitants being

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:10%
overcome by a wave of water.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And in another one that
I find most intriguing,

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.730 align:middle line:84%
he shows the waters,
but now these waters

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:90%
have icebergs in them.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
When this object hit, it was ice
and some huge icebergs or ice

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.430 align:middle line:90%
chunks--

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.690 align:middle line:90%
didn't melt initially.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.213 align:middle line:84%
They got coursed
as the courser made

00:26:24.213 --> 00:26:25.380 align:middle line:90%
their way around the planet.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to know is how
did Churchward know that.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Where did he get
his information?

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And does that information
currently exist?

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the area we have come
to know as the mighty Pacific

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:90%
have once been mostly land.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Roughly 12,900 years ago?

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of the journey, Earth
has become the watery planet

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:90%
of this majestic solar system.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:84%
As alternative
researchers search

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:84%
beneath the surface
for more evidence

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.710 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient
civilization in the Pacific,

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.880 align:middle line:84%
the stories survived through
the sacred teachings, practices,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and relics found throughout
this infamous territory known

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.680 align:middle line:90%
as Mu, the ancient motherland.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
