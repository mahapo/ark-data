00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:10%
>> 2,500 miles off
the coast of Peru,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the
South Pacific Ocean,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:10%
is one of the most
mysterious prediluvian sites

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:10%
Easter Island, also
referred to as Rapa Nui.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
In 2017, a team of researchers
dug up Moai monoliths

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
on Easter Island and
were stunned to find

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the statues bodies buried
below the Earth some 33 feet.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
While excavating these
statues, the team

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
found etched
petroglyphs on the backs

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:84%
of the figures, most commonly
in the shape of crescents,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
as well as hands that wrapped
across the figure's waists.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:84%
They also discovered
red dye on the monoliths

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
that scientists
determined was created

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
by heating a mixture of
magnetite and hematite.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream understanding is
that the ancient inhabitants

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
of Easter Island were
only 800 years old

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and that the Moai
monoliths reflect this age.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
But alternative
researchers point out

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:84%
that this discovery
uncovers a much older truth.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:84%
One that brings back
the timeline of humanity

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:90%
before the Great Deluge.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:10%
>> So 2017, finally, the year
archeologists had a chance

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:10%
to dig deep into Easter Islands
and look at the Moai who,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:10%
we tend to think of these
beautiful little faces looking

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:10%
at the sky.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine to their
surprise that they

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
dig 40 feet into
the volcanic tuff

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and, well, they have a body,
and that the resemblance

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
of legs and the hands nicely
positioned around the navel.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And on top of it, they found
some lovely inscriptions

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
on the back of the
statues, like tattoos.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Even with a little bit of
the red ocher still attached

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to it suggesting
that the statues

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
themselves had been painted
in the earlier times.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:84%
This is very important for
a whole bunch of reasons.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
For once, we can actually get
to the bottom of the statue,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.290 align:middle line:84%
literally, put a
probe under the statue

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and extricate some
organic material

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
to find out how old the
statues have been there.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in touch with the
lead archeologist at the site.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, we've
found some organic material.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we can now do some DNA.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:84%
We can actually tell when
the statues were put there.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, four years
later, the information

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.610 align:middle line:90%
still hasn't been made public.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a
conspiracy theorist,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:84%
but I'm beginning to
suspect that the dates are

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:84%
going to be very uncomfortable
for mainstream archeology.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And having spoken to geologists
on the subject, that 40-feet

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
of material covering
a very long body

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.093 align:middle line:84%
does not account for
800 years of erosion

00:03:09.093 --> 00:03:10.510 align:middle line:84%
on Easter Island,
especially given

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:90%
the climate in Easter Islands.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
a dating which is going

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.160 align:middle line:90%
to be very, very inconvenient.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> At Easter Island, we
have these great Moai heads.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thought that
just stopped at the chest.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:10%
Actually, when they
started digging,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:10%
they discovered that these
Moai had full bodies,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.433 align:middle line:10%
super megalithic bodies.

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Now when you look
at these bodies,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.180 align:middle line:84%
they had all this
ornate carving on them.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the same
thing at Gobekli Tepe,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:84%
where they dug out this area
and found these pillars,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
they have these same
ornate drawings on them.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
You can see the similar
birds, similar animals.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And what's incredible
is the animals and birds

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and the other objects
carved are not

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
from the region, neither from
Gobekli Tepe nor Easter Island.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:90%
So what is this?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:10%
How can we have two of the
very similar carvings of things

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.410 align:middle line:10%
not from those regions,
halfway across the world.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So Easter Island was an
eye opener for a lot of us

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.950 align:middle line:84%
to make us say, well obviously,
these civilizations were

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:90%
linked in some way.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:10%
>> So there are similarities
between the styles of carving,

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:10%
the 3D relief carving on Easter
Island as there are places like

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:10%
Gobekli Tepe.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Now people think there's no
connection between these two

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.187 align:middle line:84%
ancient cultures, but there
really looks like there is.

00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the
most obvious things

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that they have
these hands, very long fingers

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
pointing towards the navel.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Now not only do we get that
design on the Gobekli Tepe T

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
pillars, in these abstract human
forms, we get it on the Moai.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But also we must remember that
in tradition, Easter Island

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
was traditionally called
the navel of the world.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, Gobekli Tepe
was called Potbelly Hill.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Again, referencing the navel.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is all about the
omphalos, the sacred center,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and building your
civilization around this kind

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:90%
of sacred point.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And both of these had
the same tradition

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.860 align:middle line:90%
which is very, very strange.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
A site called Nevali Cori
in Southeast Turkey, which

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.510 align:middle line:84%
dates to around 10,000
to 11,000 years old,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:90%
it's now been destroyed.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the sister sites
to Gobekli Tepe and Karahan

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Tepe.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And here, they have
multiple statues, again,

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
like Easter Island, with these
hands going towards the navel.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:84%
But one of the statues
has an identical design

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
to what we find on
one of the bases

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that Moai stand on
in Easter Island.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to
be like two dancing,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:90%
standing up human forms.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:10%
And this is on one
of the statues,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.880 align:middle line:10%
and it's partly ceramic
that we find at Nevali Cori.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:10%
But it's also on one of
the foundation blocks

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.318 align:middle line:10%
of the Moais in Easter Island.

00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at them,
I couldn't believe it.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:90%
They're almost identical.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Several ancient traditions
speak of specific energy

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
centers, or chakras,
within the human body.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Could the posture of these
megalithic prediluvian statues

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:84%
be pointing future
civilizations to the importance

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
of these sacred
areas in the body?

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:10%
>> When we consider the
possibility that ancient

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.860 align:middle line:10%
civilizations,
prediluvian civilizations,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:10%
could have developed in a
cyclic manner and that there is

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:10%
a continuity of knowledge
and information, tradition,

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.770 align:middle line:10%
that is carried
from cycle to cycle,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:10%
one of the key places that
we begin to see some of these

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:10%
traditions is with the
depictions of the people who

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:10%
lived during these times.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:90%
The people themselves.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
How are they depicted, what
are their body postures, what

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
are they showing
us about themselves

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and their relationship
to the world.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island is a
fascinating example of this.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.270 align:middle line:84%
As the excavations have
revealed more to the statues

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
in the Easter Island than were
known to exist in the past,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:84%
as the excavations have
taken below ground level

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and shown that there are
entire bodies that accompany

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
the heads, it's
the hand positions

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:90%
that are intriguing scholars.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.630 align:middle line:84%
The way the hands are
placed on the body.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
They're not simply
at their sides,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
but they're showing a
particular part of the body.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, do we
see that in other places?

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:90%
The answer is, we do.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And we see it in a
very interesting way.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:10%
In Peru, for example,
there is the legend

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:10%
that lake Titicaca of how
the Peruvian people began.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.450 align:middle line:84%
When a being from another
world came to this world,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and the being that came
is named Tumi, T-U-M-I.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And Tumi's hands are
always placed also in front

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
of the body, to the very
particular part of the body,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.390 align:middle line:90%
on the heart chakra.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one of the
most fascinating

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
is with Gobekli Tepe, where
we see the representations

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
of the humans, and their hands
are placed on the solar plexus

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have two
cultures hands placed

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:90%
precisely the same place.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we begin looking at
other cultures, what we find

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
is that their hands are placed
on other chakras as well.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In Easter Island, they
are lower energy centers

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.730 align:middle line:90%
or lower chakras.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Peru, middle chakras.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we look
into Egypt, we begin

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:84%
seeing that the hands are placed
over the solar plexus chakra.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Each of these has very
particular significance

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:90%
within the culture itself.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:84%
With Peru being a very
feminine, very heart

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.070 align:middle line:90%
based culture, for example.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:84%
In Easter Island,
what we find is

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
that it is that
energy of survival

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and being able to transcend
the elements whatever hardships

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:84%
and challenges face
the people, that

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.110 align:middle line:84%
is derived from those lower
energy centers, precisely where

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:84%
the hands are placed
from the statues that

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:90%
are being excavated today.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that the Moai are
sharing the same period of time

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:10%
or the same age
when the hardships

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth and the
challenges the people faced

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.280 align:middle line:10%
were so great that
they had to draw

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:10%
upon this aspect of
themselves just to survive?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We also have now the idea
that the statues themselves

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.650 align:middle line:84%
with their hands
pointing at the belly.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.200 align:middle line:84%
These are found all the
way throughout Polynesia.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
They're found in the Korean
Peninsula, found in South

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:90%
America, and Gobekli Tepe.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.090 align:middle line:90%
So here's the connection.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:84%
If the earliest carbon-14
dating of Gobekli Tepe

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
is now at 10,200 BC,
we have a problem.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the same image of
the pillar with the hands

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
clutching the belly is also
found in Easter Island,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and the debris on Easter Island
is much old than 800 years.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Now we begin to
realize that whoever

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
put the statues on
Easter Island and carved

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
the statues in
Gobekli Tepe, they

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:84%
had to be bore in
from the same manual.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:84%
They may have been ostensibly
the same people, or at least

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
the same groups of people
belonging to the same academy.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And not just that, but
different academies

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
around the world who are bore
in from exactly the same manual,

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're all following
the same procedure.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It opens up the whole
story of humanity.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these monoliths connect
with the ancient structures

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:90%
of Gobekli Tepe?

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And if so, does that
mean they could have been

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:90%
carved over 12,000 years ago?

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:84%
An ancient carving
has been found

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:90%
on the back of these heads.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
How does this connect the
inhabitants of Easter Island

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.170 align:middle line:84%
to the Middle East,
Turkey, or even Egypt?

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1864, we find a Roman
Catholic friar was exploring

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:10%
the villages in Easter Island.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:10%
And what he noticed is in many
of the homes of the Rapa Nui

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:10%
people, the Native
people of Easter Island,

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:10%
he would find various
sticks or tablets

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.885 align:middle line:10%
that had these strange
etchings on them.

00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And as he looked
at the etchings,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
he noticed that they were in
the shape of humans or animals,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.298 align:middle line:90%
or other geometric forms.

00:11:01.298 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:10%
And when he asked the
people what they are,

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:10%
they would say, oh,
it's Rongorongo.

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:10%
And when we go into the Rapa
Nui language, the language

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.260 align:middle line:10%
of the Native
Easter Islanders, we

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.410 align:middle line:10%
find that Rongorongo means
to speak out or to cite.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So it suggests that
it's a form of language.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But what does this
language mean?

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, we don't know.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't have enough
examples of it.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have enough
way of correlating it

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:90%
to other languages.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So we can't quite translate
what this language is.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And even when we were to
ask native Rapa Nui people,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.743 align:middle line:90%
we get some mixed messages here.

00:11:34.743 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people seem to
suggest that they know it,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:84%
but they're not going to let
outsiders know what these mean.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And other people
suggest, no, we don't

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:90%
know what this is all about.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, the
language of Rongorongo

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:90%
continues to be undeciphered.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But what we find very
interesting is in Pakistan,

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:55.620 align:middle line:84%
thousands of miles
away, Mohenjo-daro

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.200 align:middle line:84%
has almost the exact
same form of writing.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:90%
So what does that suggest?

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Rongorongo is a mysterious
script that is found

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:10%
on tablets, wooden tablets,
that were discovered at Easter

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:10%
Island and created by
the Easter Islanders.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.920 align:middle line:10%
And for a long time, nobody
could decipher this script.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It has these very
strange figures.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
These humanoid figures
with dots beside them,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.560 align:middle line:84%
or bird-headed humans,
or these circular images

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.350 align:middle line:90%
that made no sense to anybody.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.560 align:middle line:10%
Then recently, Dr.
Robert Schoch was

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.240 align:middle line:10%
investigating Easter Island.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:10%
And his wife, Catherine Ulissey,
made an important discovery.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
She looked at the Rongorongo
script and said, wait a minute,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:84%
this looks exactly like what
Dr. Anthony Peratt from Texas

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.080 align:middle line:84%
is investigating
with plasma forms.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
When solar storms occur, we
see these very strange images

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:90%
that can form in the sky.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, Catherine Ulissey
looks at these images

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and compares it to
the Rongorongo script

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and realizes they're
virtually identical,

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
and puts forward the
hypothesis that what

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
we could be looking at
with the Rongorongo script

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
are ancient records of what
the Easter Islanders saw

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:84%
in the night sky or during this
time of intense solar flare

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:84%
The thing is this
solar flare activity

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:90%
is dated to around 10,000 BC.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening here
with the Rongorongo script

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
is that they are repeating
over and over these imagery

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.232 align:middle line:84%
and they might have lost
the original meaning.

00:13:32.232 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they didn't realize

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
it referred to what they
were seeing in the sky.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:84%
However, it is a
faithful reproduction

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.750 align:middle line:84%
of what one could have seen
during a high plasma event

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:84%
as recorded in
the ancient world.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Investigators have been
comparing the symbols

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:84%
that we see on
the Moai with what

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
we see at places
like Gobekli Tepe

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and finding a very
important correspondence.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:10%
This is important
because, once again,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:10%
if the Easter
Islanders are recording

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:10%
what they saw in a plasma
event around 10,000 BC,

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:10%
this aligns with the time
period in which Gobekli Tepe is

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.500 align:middle line:10%
constructed as well.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's suggesting that
both of these cultures

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:84%
are seeing the same
thing in the sky

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and recording the same symbols.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>> What's interesting about
Rongorongo is that they're like

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.695 align:middle line:84%
hieroglyphs, very similar
to Egyptian hieroglyphs even

00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:23.070 align:middle line:84%
though they're
totally different.

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And all attempts to
decipher them have actually

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:90%
been unsuccessful.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But again, how did they get
there, who put them there,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and what is the connection
between Rongorongo

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.630 align:middle line:90%
and the Indus Valley?

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the great enigmas
of Easter Island is a written

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
This is known to us as
the Rongorongo language.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Rongorongo would
seem to have been

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:84%
part of the culture of
Easter Island which involved

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:90%
the symbolism of the birdman.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
This would seem to have
been very, very important.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And we find this
bird man imagery

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
within the different
picture graphs

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:90%
of the Rongorongo language.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.090 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
we can't decipher it,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:15.650 align:middle line:84%
nor can they, the Easter
Island peoples of today.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
But as early as
1936, it was realized

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that there was some similarity
between the Rongorongo script

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and a similar script found
in the Indus Valley, of what

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.640 align:middle line:90%
is today Pakistan.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was realized
that there may well

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:43.010 align:middle line:84%
have been some cross contact
between the Indus Valley

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:48.350 align:middle line:84%
civilization all the way out
into the Pacific and Polynesia,

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
all the way across
to Easter Island.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:10%
That would suggest that
there was some common source

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:10%
of this written language
that links the Indus Valley

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:10%
culture with this lost
script at Easter Island.

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:90%
So what is the link?

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is the
greatest mystery.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Because what it could suggest is
that peoples coming all the way

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.040 align:middle line:84%
from what is today
Pakistan and India,

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:84%
actually went all the
way out into the Pacific

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and reached as far
as Easter Island.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these ancient
civilizations be using these

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
monuments to tell us something
they collectively witnessed

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.980 align:middle line:84%
in the sky thousands
of years ago?

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Were these massive statues
depictions of the prediluvian

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
gods during the time
of the Mu civilization?

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:84%
What other clues around
these megalithic marvels

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.542 align:middle line:84%
point to the interconnection
of prediluvian civilizations?

00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some really
interesting structures

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
on Easter Island and
they are called the ahu,

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and it literally means
a sacred platform.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:90%
There's quite a number of them.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
newer than others.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:10%
And you can tell the
older ones because they A,

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.000 align:middle line:10%
built with much bigger
stone, and also they're

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:10%
made out of really
hard stone as if you

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:10%
want to make life really
easy for yourself.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:10%
Go for the hardest rock and
make it as big as possible.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:10%
And it's funny how we
go forward in time,

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:10%
the work gets smaller
and much more decrepit.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:10%
So if we look at
the oldest ahu, it's

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:10%
a great word because
it's actually a variation

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.760 align:middle line:10%
of an Egyptian word called aha.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:10%
And an aha was the nickname
for a group of gods,

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:10%
who were pre-flood gods,
called the Acu Shemsu Hor,

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:10%
literally the shining
ones, followers of Horus.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
Egyptian word that

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
is describing the
gods of Egypt doing

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:84%
on an island in the
middle of the Pacific?

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.805 align:middle line:84%
Well, you find the rest of that
story in South America, where

00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
the same people are known by
a completely different name.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
understand Aymara language

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:90%
in that connection.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So the connection is if you
look at these platforms,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the sacred platforms of
the gods in Easter Island,

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:84%
you'd also find the same
method of construction

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
in Sacsayhuaman,
at Machu Picchu,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and also at the base of
the pyramid attributed

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:84%
to Menkaure in Giza plateau,
also at the Osireion in Abydos.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:90%
So now we have a problem here.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the same
method of construction

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
on a tiny island 19 miles by 3
in the middle of the Pacific,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
which is found in South
America and also in Egypt.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, the connecting
point to all of this

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:84%
is the name of the platform,
which is the word that's

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle line:90%
only found in Egypt.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.503 align:middle line:84%
And it defines the
very people who

00:18:36.503 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:84%
were the gods, who
used to travel around

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
the world in canoes, who
are master astronomers.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
They all appear
in groups of seven

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.400 align:middle line:84%
led by one charismatic
leader, no matter

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:90%
which continent you're in.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:10%
>> These Moai statues were
placed on these platforms

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:10%
called ahu.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And these were to support them.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But there is one of
them known as Vinapu,

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's constructed of
massive polygonal blocks that

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.880 align:middle line:90%
perfectly fit together.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can hardly fit
a banknote between them.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And when this was first
discovered in the 19th century,

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
the Vinapu Ahu, with its
polygon or stone wall,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
was absolutely in
perfect condition.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, a certain amount
of very crude excavations

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:90%
has destroyed part of it today.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's still there and
it can still be viewed.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:10%
But what's so
significant about this

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:10%
is that it is very, very similar
to megalithic polygonal stone

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:10%
walls in places like the
complex of Sacsayhuaman,

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:10%
which is just on the edge of
the city of Cuzco in Peru.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.860 align:middle line:10%
And it was the great
explorer, Thor Heyerdahl,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:10%
in the 1960s who
proposed that there

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.820 align:middle line:10%
may have been a link between
the peoples of Easter

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:21.220 align:middle line:10%
Island and the Peruvian
civilizations, maybe the Incas.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And he believed
that Peru was Hiva,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.620 align:middle line:84%
the actual point of foundation
of the people of Easter Island.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Having said this,
there is good evidence

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:84%
that Hiva was
actually a lost land

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:90%
to the west of Easter Island.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Because firstly, it would seem
that the earliest founders

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of the Rapa Nui
culture may well have

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:84%
come from an island group
known as the Marquesas islands.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they brought
this huge spherical stone

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:84%
from which now represents the
navel of the world on Easter

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:90%
Island.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:84%
But that was not
their start point.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.280 align:middle line:84%
It would seem as if they
came from much further west.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And if we are looking
for some kind of landmass

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that could have
constituted Hiva,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
then the most obvious place
of foundation is Sundaland.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Sundaland was the
huge island landmass

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that is now today
Indonesia, which

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:84%
was once linked via peninsula
to mainland Southeast Asia,

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and would seem to have had
high culture there going back

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:84%
possibly as much as 20,000
to 25,000 years ago.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible that the
earliest settlers on Easter

00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Island started their
journey as far West as what

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:90%
is today Indonesia.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Was there an ancient
civilization that spaned

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:90%
the entire globe?

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
And if so, who
were they, and why

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:84%
were remnants of
their culture left

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:90%
scattered across the planet?

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:10%
>> So first of all,
Easter Island, Rapa Nui,

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:10%
is one of the three main spots
of the Pacific Ocean protecting

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:10%
the territory of Mu.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember also that
for the ancient civilizations,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:84%
the power that they discovered
about themselves was according

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.170 align:middle line:90%
to special spots in the planet.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
So they would take care of those
special spots on the planet,

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:90%
protecting them.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So the main territory
of the Pacific Ocean

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.250 align:middle line:84%
was protected between Hawaii,
Easter Island, Rapa Nui,

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:90%
and North Island in New Zealand.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So this triangle were protecting
the main paths and doors

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Mu civilization
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:10%
So Rapa Nui was
the last connection

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.200 align:middle line:10%
to go to South
America and to connect

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:10%
with all information there,
as also for North America,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:10%
in some cases, in
Central America, mostly.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So it was like one
of the sacred spots

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to connect with the Andes.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, South
America was trying

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:84%
to be protected by
the Mu civilization

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.690 align:middle line:84%
so the Atlantis
civilization wouldn't

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.500 align:middle line:84%
get the last part of the
snake of the planet, which

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:84%
was the root chakra of
the snake going down.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And that would allow
any civilization

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that would control that to
manifest around the world.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they were taking
care of the Andes in that time.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And that island there,
which is one of the greatest

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.670 align:middle line:84%
portals of the network,
was the guardian

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:90%
of the Andes and the Pacific.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So they were not heads,
they were entire bodies.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But they would be the guardians
of the whole territory,

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:90%
the guardians of everything.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:10%
So they would be protecting
the main connection

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:10%
that they had with other
dimensions down-up.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:10%
So that's why they would
be position in a way

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.770 align:middle line:10%
that they would
protect the main portal

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.120 align:middle line:10%
of the whole territories.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The Andes and the Pacific
relies on the power of Rapa Nui

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.500 align:middle line:90%
to connect to the skies.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:10%
That was their thing in
that part of the world.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So the huge statues would be
like the Sphinx of the Pacific

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Ocean taking care, that
anyone from outside

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:84%
would be able to
go to those portals

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
or to go through this special
portal of the entire Pacific.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So just a few of them were
looking towards the skies, that

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.620 align:middle line:84%
were the guardians that
received information from above,

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
and the other ones were
spreading the information

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:90%
and protecting the information.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.780 align:middle line:10%
So those people
standing there were

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:10%
like a symbol to manifest
all the guardians of Mu.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:31.320 align:middle line:84%
All the wise people of Mu
manifested there for eternity.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.340 align:middle line:84%
It's like in Egyptian
tradition, carving the shapes

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:90%
of the kings and the queens.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So they did the same,
but with the wise ones

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that would take care forever of
those portals in the Pacific.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> If the megaliths on this
island are part of an ancient

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Mu civilization, did the
inhabitants of this island also

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.750 align:middle line:84%
understand how to use the
energetic properties within

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:90%
these massive stones?

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:10%
>> The Moai that we find on
Easter Island are actually very

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:10%
consistent with other standing
stones that we find around

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.570 align:middle line:10%
the world.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So these standing
stones were often

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:84%
thought of as being
representations of the gods.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.530 align:middle line:84%
It was like a signal
out to the gods.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And these stones, many
times, had, I'm going to say,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:84%
crystalline properties or some
kind of vibrational properties

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:90%
of their own.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were often
placed in areas

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.200 align:middle line:84%
where there was a high
vibrational energy, often

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:90%
considered telluric energy.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:39.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I think Easter Island was
part of the ancient Mu empire

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.250 align:middle line:10%
because it does one particular
thing that ancient sites

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:10%
worldwide don't.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So Easter Island has its own
unique energetic properties.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Mainly down to Earth energies,
but the shape of the Easter

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Island statues as well.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the 1930, you had
two very famous master dowsers

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:90%
called Chaumery and de Belizal.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And they looked into the
shape of Easter Island statues

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and made models to the, near
enough the same size but much

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:90%
smaller, a harmonic of it.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And what they found
and discovered

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.120 align:middle line:84%
about these harmonic
statues that they created

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.870 align:middle line:84%
is that they could generate
such a strong energy field.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:10%
And they researched
it and found that

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:10%
within three days using these
models of the Easter Island

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.310 align:middle line:10%
statues, that they
could preserve meat.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:90%
They could make energy travel.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting to
know that on Easter Island,

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.990 align:middle line:84%
all of the statues
are facing outwards.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
All of them are generating
a force field that

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
is exceptionally powerful that
can regenerate and push out

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
what some would say is
such an immense force,

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.810 align:middle line:90%
it could be tapped into.

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was a component
of their ancient civilization

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
to generate that
particular frequency.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.565 align:middle line:84%
It's not generated on that level
anywhere else in the world.

00:28:13.565 --> 00:28:16.100 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Could Easter Island be the
last remaining key of an even

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.660 align:middle line:84%
older network on the planet,
spanning thousands of years

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:84%
before the known
civilizations on this planet?

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.410 align:middle line:84%
If this is the case,
could their existence

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:84%
have been one in connection with
the Earth on a deeper level?

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.870 align:middle line:84%
A cataclysm might have destroyed
a great advanced civilization

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.960 align:middle line:84%
but one thing
remains, ancient stone

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.080 align:middle line:84%
heads with bodies
providing evidence

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.450 align:middle line:84%
that scientists have
barely scratched

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:90%
the surface of understanding.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Evidence of an
ancient prediluvian

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.160 align:middle line:90%
time we can barely fathom.
