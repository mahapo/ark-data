biggest mystery of all

is the impracticality
of its construction.

We're talking about
a huge complex that

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
was constructed during Roman

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.050 align:middle line:84%

the hell created those stones

superhuman how these massive

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:90%
It could be done.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It could be done with
rollers, block and tackle.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:10%
It would be quite an effort.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.153 align:middle line:10%
And there was a reason to do it.

00:02:58.153 --> 00:02:59.540 align:middle line:10%
The temple is on a hill.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:10%
You would need very, very
strong retaining walls.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Huge pieces of stone are
useful in that regard.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:90%
So there is a practical answer.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
But the more magical
speculation is

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:84%
there must have been
some special purpose

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
to this location and
these massive stones that

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
is beyond our current
understanding.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
The reason for them would be to
build very powerful retaining

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
walls so that this temple
would last forever.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:84%

the size of the stones,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:10%

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:10%

And here are these
stones that apparently

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
were constructed in
such a way, and just

as to create
incredible strength.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just one of the most

say, or a fort of

Graham Hancock believes
the larger stones

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.910 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the temple
pre-date the Roman Empire.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Archaeologists have one thing
that they regard as a killer

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:10%
argument for why the Romans must
have made the megalithic wall

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:10%
as well as the temple.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
in the foundations

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
of the megalithic wall,
visible, but in the foundations,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:90%
is a Roman--

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:90%
a bit of a Roman temple column.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the
foundations of the walls.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Come around the corner onto
the west side of the wall,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
and there you find
the famous Trilithon,

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
which is curious, freestanding,
unconnected, megalithic wall.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Which doesn't look much like
other Roman stuff actually.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the three giant
blocks that surrounds

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:90%
the Temple of Jupiter.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And each of those blocks
weighs more than 900 tons.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And they are placed so perfectly
into position that you cannot

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
get a sheet of paper
into the joints.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.388 align:middle line:10%
And they're 20 feet
above the ground.

00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So the archaeologists
will say, look,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:84%
we've got a Temple
of Jupiter up on top.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
We've got a Roman
column drum being

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.440 align:middle line:84%
used as a block in the
foundations of the wall.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.906 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the whole thing
was made by the Romans.

00:05:57.906 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But what they're not
taking account of

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that Baalbeck was
used as a fortress for hundreds

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:90%
and hundreds of years.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm very strongly of the
view that that Roman column

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.125 align:middle line:84%
drum in the foundations
of the megalithic wall

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the
Temple of Jupiter

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:84%
is a later repair, rather
than an original block.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
They found Roman columns lying
around all over the place,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and they stuffed that
in there and used

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:90%
it to repair that wall.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that that column

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:84%
drum proves that the
megalithic wall was

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.160 align:middle line:90%
the work of the Romans.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
another thing, which

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:84%
is if you go to the supposed
quarry from which the Baalbeck

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
stones were taken, you find
three really humongous blocks

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:90%
of stone.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.705 align:middle line:84%
Two of them have been well known
for the last 100 years or so.

00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:48.080 align:middle line:84%
One's called-- I
don't know why--

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:84%
it's called the stone
of the pregnant woman.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.460 align:middle line:90%
I stood on top of it.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:84%
When you're on top of
it, you are dwarfed

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:90%
by the scale of the thing.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
This block weighs 1,000 tons.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
It's sticking up
at a kind of angle.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
It's been cleanly separated
from the bedrock underneath.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:90%
There's a cut.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:90%
And it's just sitting there.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Across the road is a
second giant block.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
That one is calculated
to weigh 1,460 tons,

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:84%
still sitting there in
place in the quarry,

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and only discovered
by the archaeologists

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
in 2014 because it was
covered by sediment.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So the archaeologists say
the Romans did everything.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.375 align:middle line:84%
The Romans made those
megalithic blocks.

00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me this is just a
very un-Roman thing to do.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
The Romans were extremely
pragmatic people.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
If they had quarried
those blocks,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:84%
even if they had found
they couldn't move them,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
they would not have
left them there.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
The Romans were never
involved with those blocks.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even know
those blocks were there.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I think we are looking
at, if you like,

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
an antediluvian
presence at Baalbeck.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think in some way
the Romans tapped into that

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and honored that
with their 54 columns

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:90%
around the Temple of Jupiter.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it really possible that
a megalithic structure was

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:10%
standing at Baalbek years before
the time of the great deluge?

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Were these massive
stones constructed

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
with the same mathematical codes
as the Great Pyramids at Giza?

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And if so, where does
this knowledge come from?

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:10%
>> That system of numbers as
a sacred system of numbers is

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.910 align:middle line:10%
found in virtually
every culture on Earth,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.789 align:middle line:10%
whether they know
that it comes--

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:10%
that it's generated by a
key motion of the Earth

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:10%
itself is another
question, but that it

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.470 align:middle line:10%
was part of a sacred system
of numbers that had come down

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.577 align:middle line:10%
from remotest antiquity.

00:08:44.577 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I think the Romans were the
inheritors of that knowledge

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.952 align:middle line:90%
as much as anything else.

00:08:47.952 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
Temple of Jupiter

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
was placed where it
is placed precisely

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.645 align:middle line:84%
because of that
megalithic U shaped

00:08:54.645 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:84%
wall that surrounds the temple
of Jupiter on three sides.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
I think they nestled it in to
the pre-existing structure.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Temple of Jupiter was built
upon older Canaanite temples,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.360 align:middle line:10%
which were built
on earlier temples,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:10%
which were built on
earlier structures.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:84%
There is a sect of
Maronite Christians

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:90%
that live in Lebanon.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And they say that the original
structure, whatever it was,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:84%
was built by Cain, who
was the son of Adam.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So that means that whatever
original structure had

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.270 align:middle line:84%
been built there was built
very close to the beginning

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:90%
of human life on this planet.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But as far as I'm
concerned, the beginning

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:84%
of human life on
this planet dates

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.550 align:middle line:84%
back to the very beginnings
of the history of life

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, many millions
or billions of years ago.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If Baalbek was indeed
built on earlier structures,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
could this be a location that
was built by Sumerian gods.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:10%
>> What's so interesting
about it is when you look

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.610 align:middle line:10%
at the original gods
from Mesopotamia,

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:10%
how the figures
of Enki and Enlil,

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:10%
how they all came to basically
take different names in Greece.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years later you
get Prometheus and you get Zeus.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at what
they were said to do,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
they were said to have done the
same things as Enki and Enlil.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Then you got the Roman gods,
which then grew out of that.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So you may be talking about
the same gods over a very

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:90%
long period of time.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
They may be all the
same story ultimately.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.342 align:middle line:90%


00:10:44.342 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> There does appear to have
been a civilization from

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
our solar system that landed
and set up shop in this area

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:90%
of Lebanon, as well as in Sumer.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Baalbeck very nicely
fits in with reports

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
that we see from the
Sumerian cuneiform tablets

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that Baalbeck had to be one
of the central locations were

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Enlil and Enki were
actually working.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But was Baalbeck also
the location for some kind

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:90%
of powerful ancient weaponry?

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:10%
And is it more
than a coincidence

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:10%
that many of the ancient
megalithic structures

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:10%
nearby look to bear the
scars of some great battle?

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the state
of how Baalbeck is today,

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:84%
it's obviously a site that
has suffered an incredible,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:90%
catastrophic level of damage.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did that damage
actually take place?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
One potential theory is that
some sort of cataclysmic Earth

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.120 align:middle line:90%
change activity happened.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.612 align:middle line:84%
But if that was
true, wouldn't it

00:11:39.612 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
make sense that the flood
waters or earthquakes

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.640 align:middle line:84%
would have damaged the
base of the building?

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Instead what we appear to see
is that the top of the building

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.900 align:middle line:84%
has been smashed
off or scattered,

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:90%
but the bottom is actually OK.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
This may be a result
of a battle that

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:84%
involved much more of a manmade
or extraterrestrial made

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:90%
weaponry.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:10%
This structure clearly
was built with stones

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:10%
that were so heavy
that it was meant

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:10%
to withstand enormous,
enormous amount of attack.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And that again would
suggest that it

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.680 align:middle line:84%
could have been built by
people who were at war,

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and that now we're seeing
the shattered remnant of what

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:90%
was left behind.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible this is the
remnants of an ancient battle?

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:10%
And could this ancient battle
have perpetuated more battles

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:10%
between good and evil?

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The name Baalbek is derived
from the Canaanite god Baal.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Canaanites
in and of themselves

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.345 align:middle line:84%
are also called the
bloodline of Cain,

00:12:30.345 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:84%
which goes all the way back
to the biblical story of Adam

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and Eve, where in the
secret religion of the elite

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:84%
they believed that Cain was
Lucifer's child, that they were

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:84%
all descendants of the bloodline
of Cain, and for the elite,

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.360 align:middle line:84%
this is their religion, and
they take it very seriously.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
I think Baal was highly
feared and worshipped

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:90%
when he came to Earth.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what happens in
the Roman history tradition,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:84%
we have Rome that was at war
with the other big superpower

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.430 align:middle line:84%
of that era, which we now
don't even hear about.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a country
called Carthage.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Carthage was a Phoenician
civilization on the African

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:90%
coast of the Mediterranean.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting to note
that in the first Millennium

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:84%
before Christ it was the
only empire to rival Rome.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But during the Punic Wars, Rome
quickly overpowered Carthage,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.690 align:middle line:90%
claiming the city as its own.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Was this because
the Roman Empire

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:84%
ascended from a force more
powerful than mortal man?

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:10%
And if so, could the
Temple of Jupiter

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:10%
had been founded on some kind
of extraterrestrial culture?

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Around the Temple of Jupiter
there used to be 54 columns.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
54, what's the
significance of that?

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Remember I mentioned
that the heartbeat

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
of the processional
cycle is the number 72?

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:84%
For one degree of procession,
72 years must pass.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:57.610 align:middle line:84%
If you take 72 and add to
it half of 72, which is 36,

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:90%
you get 108.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Divide 108 by 2 and you get 54.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
That links the
number 54 directly

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:90%
to the processional cycle.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, these permutations
of the number 72,

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
these developments and
elaborations out of the number

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:84%
72, these multiples and
divisors of the number 72

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.192 align:middle line:84%
are also found all around the
world in ancient mythology.

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:27.542 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.542 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> When the Romans built
the Temple of Jupiter,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.320 align:middle line:84%
they realized that they were
looking at the ruins that had

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
been built by
pre-Adamite survivors.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.917 align:middle line:90%
They took this seriously.

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
They saw that this awesome stone
site, which clearly could not

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.930 align:middle line:84%
be built by conventional
means, was an embodiment

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:90%
of their religion.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> But what could the Romans
have realized at Baalbeck that

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:84%
moved them to
build on top of it?

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I became very interested
in ancient civilizations.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I was reading about
various stone architectures

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The Baalbek stone structure
is pretty interesting

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.488 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:15:01.488 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
The estimates of the
weight of these stones

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:90%
is literally 1,650 tons.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to have in our
conventional way, a crane,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:84%
in order to move
something 50 tons.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
The crane has to weigh
more than 50 tons or else

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.530 align:middle line:90%
the crane is going to tip over.

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So how in the world
do you move something

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:90%
with that much weight?

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.090 align:middle line:10%
You'd have to have a crane that
weighed more than 1,650 tons.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:10%
Who in the world would build
that, and where would it be?

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.770 align:middle line:10%
Then not only
that, but the crane

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.470 align:middle line:10%
would have to be able to elevate
these slabs more than 50 feet

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:10%
up.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way
we can do that.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So what in the world is
going on in Baalbeck?

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
What in the world is
going on with this ruin?

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.890 align:middle line:84%
What seems to be more
likely is that there

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, a
portal type of energy

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that was created at Baalbek by
virtue of how the stones were

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:90%
built and aligned.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.587 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.587 --> 00:15:49.170 align:middle line:84%
There was something
about these stones

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.295 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand
where they function almost

00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
like tuning forks to capture
these natural portals that

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.703 align:middle line:90%
come from inside the Earth.

00:15:55.703 --> 00:15:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Baalbek may be one
of these places

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.620 align:middle line:84%
where these normally
uncontrollable,

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:84%
natural portal events were
harnessed then, perhaps

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
by the power of
these three stones.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
When you go inside of
one of these portals

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.105 align:middle line:84%
you can actually travel
through space and time.

00:16:10.105 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I don't know
if they actually--

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:10%
if the stones at Baalbeck
possess the quartz crystal,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:10%
which would be necessary in
order to have an operational

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:10%
stargate.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:90%
They could very well.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I do know that they found
huge basins in Egypt that

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
on the outside looked like
normal stone, but on the inside

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:90%
were pure quartz crystal.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And so what you might
have at this site

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
is something very
similar to that.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Those electromagnetic fields
that are being generated

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:84%
will interact with the
electromagnetic field

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:90%
of a human body.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And with the laws of
harmonic resonance,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:84%
you could literally cause
change within the body,

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
maybe even down
to the DNA level.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Baalbeck may have been a
place to alter creation.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, Baalbeck is one of the
classic navels of the Earth.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
This is where you allow
yourself to escape

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.350 align:middle line:84%
from the limitations
of the physical world,

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.095 align:middle line:90%
connect with another world.

00:17:04.095 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:10%
And I do believe that the
stones themselves, they

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.019 align:middle line:10%
are highly piezoelectric,
because, A, they

00:17:10.019 --> 00:17:11.738 align:middle line:10%
have a special type of quartz.

00:17:11.738 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:10%
When you put all that
stuff under pressure,

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:10%
it creates a
piezoelectric effect.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:10%
You're walking into an
electromagnetic environment,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:10%
and these stones
themselves are already

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:10%
marking the intersecting
lines of the Earth's

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:10%
telluric currents.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
So they're anchoring the
actual energy of the Earth

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
to this place so it
never, never goes away.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.850 align:middle line:84%
That's why we keep
going back there.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.030 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
the energy of place.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's a truly sacred
site of enormous antiquity

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
that basically
survives like a living

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:90%
organism from age to age.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:84%
It just gets rebuilt,
and rebuilt, and rebuilt,

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:90%
and rebuilt.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> If Baalbek was able to tap
into an electromagnetic field,

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.460 align:middle line:84%
who then could have built
the first structure?

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Sonja Grace uses her alternative
research to dive deeper.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> My guides took
me in the night,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and we stood there at the edge
of this ancient site waiting.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:10%
A woman appeared
tall and slender

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:10%
with jewelry around her
neck and a skin, a fox

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:10%
around her shoulders.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.310 align:middle line:10%
She said her name was Meg.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:10%
She told me she was a
descendant of Sekhmet.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:10%
She told me that the Savroc,
the ancient ant people,

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:10%
saved her people beneath this
temple in a great cavern that

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:10%
connected to the underground
chambers where the people hid

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:10%
and survived the impact of
the comet and all the floods

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:10%
that happened
throughout the region.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
She told me that this place
and all of these places

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
were connected with the
tunnels of the Savroc

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and that the giants came
back to Earth after they

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.970 align:middle line:90%
left when Atlantis fell.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:55.965 align:middle line:90%
And they helped the people.

00:18:55.965 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
They landed their
ship at Baalbek,

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and the giants went on
to help build this site.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:10%
So what happened
with this woman Meg--

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:10%
and she had a whole group of
people standing there with me.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I want to show
you who built this site.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.630 align:middle line:10%
And she said, but
you have to trust me.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:10%
She said, I want you to
get on your hands and knees

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:10%
on the ground.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.890 align:middle line:90%
I trusted her.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I want you to put
your forehead on the ground.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I want you to say
the words, I am one with Mu.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up, and all
these giants were standing,

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:90%
surrounding the site.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It was really amazing.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
looking at these giants.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones that
said, we built this site.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.940 align:middle line:84%
We built it a long
time ago, but we helped

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:90%
this group of magicians--

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:90%
and they used that word--

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:84%
this group of
magicians from Atlantis

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to not only hide under
this sacred temple

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:84%
that we had built,
but we also helped

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:24.750 align:middle line:84%
them create places in the temple
that they could return to.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And these giants
told me that that's

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:84%
why these carvings of all
these animals were in the site.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Not only did they correlate
with the constellations

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and the stars of
that time, but they

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
were, in fact, the very
places this group of magicians

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:90%
returned to.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It was like they evaporated
and just went, (BLOWS)

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:90%
right back into the stone.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that
when the Annunaki came,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
they would take this temple,
and they would disguise it.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:84%
They would literally cloak
it like it was a lake.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:84%
So they would
reflect like a mirror

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.460 align:middle line:84%
so that they would
never see this site,

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and they would not be
able to steal their magic.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Could magic
exist at Baalbeck?

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And could civilizations before
the Annunaki have disguised it?

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, could
its main function

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
had been a device
that could help

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:90%
transform our consciousness?

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that what it comes
down to is that when the bigger

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:84%
picture emerges, I do believe
that it's going to tell us

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.990 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate purpose of these
ancient codes that our origins

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:84%
lie within the stars, and that
what we call the ancient wisdom

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:56.540 align:middle line:84%
is a legacy that was received
intuitively as downloads from

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:90%
a non terrestrial source.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not talking
here necessarily

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:10%
about spacemen coming
down in spaceships

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:10%
and just telling us
something, but that evolution

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:10%
itself has possibly
gone hand in hand

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:10%
with some kind of communion with
non terrestrial intelligences,

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:10%
which has given us some
kind of master code,

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:10%
some kind of mathematical
formula, which we know we

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:10%
probably already have,
and we almost certainly

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.660 align:middle line:10%
use it on a regular basis.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But that that same
code will eventually

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:84%
be shown to exist in the
cosmos, and that when

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:84%
we've made that link, it will
give us that first contact.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think Baalbeck and
other places like it I believe

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:10%
was seen as a sacred art where
we're trying to replicate

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:10%
and reproduce the perfection
of the pleroma or heaven here

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:10%
on Earth.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.805 align:middle line:84%
And by emulating the principles,
like using sacred geometry,

00:23:02.805 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:84%
the golden mean,
and stuff, we're

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to mimic and replicate
what already exists in heaven.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.750 align:middle line:84%
It's known as kind
of a mythopoetic.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
When you emulate the
creator by creating,

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:90%
it's seen as a very good thing.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.950 align:middle line:84%
You're mimicking
the act of creation

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.490 align:middle line:84%
yourself, which is
almost seen as a way

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.660 align:middle line:84%
to reach back into the divine
as a reflection of creation,

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:90%
cause you're sort of--

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.010 align:middle line:84%
by creating yourself, you're
almost reflecting it back

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
into the divine, and then
creating a bridge or a conduit

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
to infuse with those
energies through sympathy.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And the more we do that,
both within ourselves,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and our civilization,
our architecture,

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and the way we live, we're able
to open a conduit to heaven.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to rejoin
heaven and Earth, which

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.132 align:middle line:90%
have been separated.

00:23:51.132 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And then once we've
done that, we kind of

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
enter the kingdom of light,
which isn't somewhere else.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:90%
It's right here, right now.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:10%
It's just we have to enter it.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:10%
We have to live
it, and reproduce,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.585 align:middle line:10%
and live our lives by divine
guidance, and by principles.

00:24:03.585 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Like in alchemy, you get
heaven and Earth are often

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:84%
represented by the eagle and the
dragon, who struggle and fight

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
in this terrible battle
until they finally-- they

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.590 align:middle line:90%
end up defeating each other.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:10%
And then from their
own ashes, the phoenix

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:10%
rises, of which is the
transcendental consciousness

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:10%
from which we emerge.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Basically that's the story
of almost every religion

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:90%
is what it's about.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>> If Baalbek was built to tap
into the human consciousness

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
of the world, could it have
been decommissioned before

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:90%
the Anunnaki arrived?

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Could the constant use of
Baalbek by many civilizations

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:84%
afterwards have been an attempt
to figure out its power?

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, what
kind of civilization

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:84%
would have been moved to
change the consciousness

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.530 align:middle line:90%
of the planet?

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
what beings

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
came later that they wanted
to protect its message from?

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The king lists go
back 266,000 years.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:84%
