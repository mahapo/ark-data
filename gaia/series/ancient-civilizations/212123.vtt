of the Younger Dryas destroyed
the Atlantean and Mu Empires?

It's actually in
the Amazon basin.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It's on the equator,
and that's what the word

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Ecuador means is equator.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:10%
It's almost perfectly
situated right

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:10%
in between where we think
Atlantis was located

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:10%

of advanced engineering that we

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.810 align:middle line:84%
find in South America
is the Inca Trail.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:10%
The Inca Trail connected
all of their major sites

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:10%
together, thus
identifying that they

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:10%
were all part of the same
culture at one point in time.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really important to
remember that it's all part

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
of a similar region along
the Western side of the South

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.620 align:middle line:90%
American continent.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:10%
And I think when you
look at the evidence

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:10%
for megalithic
construction in that area,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:10%
then I think certainly
there's evidence

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:10%
for megalithic sites
stretching far back in time

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.510 align:middle line:10%
to pre-diluvian times.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
You can go all
the way South down

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
into Bolivia with sites like
Tiwanaku and Puma Punku,

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
up around the Lake
Titicaca region,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:84%
right through the
Sacred Valley of Peru

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
with sites like Ollantaytambo,
Machu Picchu, Cusco itself.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:10%
We also have ancient sites that
stretch back far beyond any

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:10%
of those cultures in places
like Chavin de Huantar which

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:10%
is in the North of Peru.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I think you pretty much
have to consider places

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
like Ecuador all part
of the same region

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:84%
because we certainly
see a similar technique,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.640 align:middle line:84%
a similar style of
megalithic buildings

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
in sites across what today
is three separate countries.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Ecuador today
we call it Ecuador.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And we call the neighbor
land we call Peru.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:90%
It's all linked.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Forget today's
national frontiers,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:10%
it was all one thing.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:84%
The Highlands of today's
Peru was the place

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
where the gods were, was the
place where they had their base

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
camp, was the place where
they teach the humans.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Also we've got to remember
this is towards the coast

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.920 align:middle line:90%
of the Pacific as well.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:10%
And so we have much
more possibilities

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:10%
going on here to make it more
ancient than people realize.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:10%
It could have been one of the
outposts of the whole Mu era.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
We've got to consider
things like this.

alternative researchers have

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
speculated that the Inca
Empire built their temples

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:84%
on ceremonial sites they
discovered from a much older

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Their most famous temple
complex Machu Picchu in Peru

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
contains the Temple
of the Sun that

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
is believed to be an ancient
ceremonial site aligned

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:90%
with the Pleiades star cluster.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
The lesser known Inca Site
located in Northern Ecuador

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:90%
is known as Ingapirca.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
This Temple of the Sun was also
built upon foundation stones

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
that are thought to have been
used for ancient solstice

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.730 align:middle line:90%

throughout South America

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:90%
long before the Inca?

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:10%
As the sites that comprise
the Inca Trail help

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:10%
alternative researchers
understand the ancient sky,

what happened when the earlier
inhabitants of this region

that there was a concerted

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:84%
move large populations of
people into what are effectively

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:84%

That's a massive

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that could have housed tens
of thousands of people.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a little known fact,
but there are miles and miles

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
of tunnels and chambers beneath
places like Saqqara, Egypt,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.133 align:middle line:90%
also at Giza.

00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I've had the chance to
explore some of these myself,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you
that there is just

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
extensive underground
work that also

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:90%
happened in places like Egypt.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
One thing we know for
sure about South America

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
is that it was intensely
affected by the Younger Dryas.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
In some places, almost
80% of megafauna

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:90%
died off in South America.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
There was tremendous
climate change

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that occurred during
the Younger Dryas.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So at some point,
it definitely seems

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:84%
like there was a real effort
to move underground potentially

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
to protect themselves from what
was happening on the surface

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
or protect themselves
from the sun.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't really know,
but at some point

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
there was a real effort
to go underground

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and to get away from
whatever was happening

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the planet.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.680 align:middle line:10%

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.050 align:middle line:10%
in the Pacific that our

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:10%
underground during a
period of darkness.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:10%
And when that darkness
went away, we came out,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:10%
and we created the
world around us today.

there is a major swarm of stuff

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
breaking up on an orbital
pathway that intersects that

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:10%
And sooner or later
within the next,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:10%
say few decades
to hundreds years,

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.160 align:middle line:10%
Earth is going to
encounter the byproducts

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:10%
of this disintegrating

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what would we
do as a civilization

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:90%
to respond to that?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's how we have
to think about previous events.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:90%
What would we do?

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:84%

to inner Ecuador.

in anthropology in Milan.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%

strange kind of gold
artifacts, tablets,

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:84%
different things like this
that he starts collecting.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And he starts to
realize that there's

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
some real enigmas attached to
this collection of artifacts.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And some of
them are wonderful.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
They are miniature carved
versions of local idols.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:90%
They are there's pottery.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:90%
There's human heads.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:90%
There's shrunken heads.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And then incredibly, there
are miniature versions

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of the statues
that you find in Babylon.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, what is that doing on the
opposite side of the world?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the biggest
mysteries we don't know.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.190 align:middle line:10%
And they're beautiful,
beautiful carvings.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at the photos
of Father Crespi's collection,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
they look like they
came from cultures,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.580 align:middle line:84%
such as the Sumerians,
the Africans, the Asians,

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:90%
as well as Europeans.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:10%
And some of the pieces
are so finely done,

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.700 align:middle line:10%
they appear as if they
came out of a museum

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:10%
somewhere around the world,
except somehow ended up

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.620 align:middle line:10%
in this remote
location in the Andes.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Over the course of time,
local people brought him

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:10%
artifacts from the jungle.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
The early ones looked physically
very similar to artifacts

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.870 align:middle line:90%
found in ancient Sumeria.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.440 align:middle line:84%
But as time went on, the
quality of the workmanship

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:90%
became more and more crude.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:10%
And so what's likely is that the
original artifacts were found,

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:10%
but then later the local people
in order to appease and please

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:10%
Father Crespi began to
manufacture artifacts.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And being a very kind
priest, he accepted

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:84%
all of the pieces that were
brought to him, which wound up

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:90%
being several thousand.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And this, of course, has
caused a lot of confusion

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
because you look at the
artifacts and you're not sure

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
which ones are the original
old ones and which ones were

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.750 align:middle line:84%
manufactured by the Indigenous
people simply to say thank you

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:84%
to him for what he was doing,
the mission that he had

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:90%
created.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But of course, questions
then arose, well,

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:84%
where do these
artifacts come from?

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And location that kept coming
up was the Cueva de los Tayos,

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.180 align:middle line:90%
the Cave of the Oilbird.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very
remote location

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:84%
in the rainforests
of Ecuador, which

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
it was said contained
incredible treasures of the past

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
as well as a library recording
evidence of some kind of lost

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:84%
civilization that
had existed in South

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:84%
America in the distant
past and may well

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:84%
have been linked with an island
continent perhaps even Mayan.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course,
this is something that

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:90%
started to interest Europeans.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:10%
Juan Moricz, a
Hungarian explorer

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:10%
started to see if he could
get in with the local Shuar

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:10%
tribe that were the
custodians of the Tayos Cave.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And in 1969, he was said to
have gone down into the cave,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
descended down this huge great
vertical shaft to get there

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:84%
hundreds and hundreds of
feet, very, very dangerous,

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
and that he then
explored the caves

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and saw what he referred
to as this metal

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.920 align:middle line:84%
library or this gold
library, which was these rows

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and rows of these tablets
in this strange script

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:84%
with these tablets looked as if
they were actually made of gold

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:84%
themselves plus many, many
other different artifacts that

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:90%
were down there.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
intrigued the world.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Every explorer of this period
wanted to be an Indiana Jones

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and go down there and try
and find this metal library.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I read a small article
about Ecuadorian caves,

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and they were artificial.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.690 align:middle line:84%
There was a man mentioned
with the name Juan Moricz,

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and I was fascinated.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote to El Telégrafo.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:90%
I never received an answer.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I simply jump in
the air in the aircraft

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:90%
and fly to Ecuador.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.560 align:middle line:90%
They were very friendly.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:90%
They knew some of my books.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them,
"hey, you published this,

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and you are about
subterranean caves in Ecuador.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Is this all true?

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Can I meet this
man, Juan Moricz?"

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
We had the connection
with Juan Moricz.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, I learned he originally
comes from Hungary.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And he speaks German.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
He brought me up
first to Carlo Crespi.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I visited Father
Crespi several times.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
He had rooms, not small
rooms, rooms and rooms

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
full of figures out of stone,
copper, silver, and gold.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:90%
And he showed me these rooms.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And Father Crespi over here--

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Eric, it's all oral.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:90%
It's all gold.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Today, I know it
was not pure gold.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:90%
It was parts of gold in it.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, where do
these figures come from?

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, the natives
gave it to me.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.500 align:middle line:10%
>> So here we have this Italian
monk with as many as 50,000

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:10%
artifacts coming from
this mysterious source,

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:10%
this Tayos Cave.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:10%
And Erich Von Däniken
writes his book in 1973,

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.450 align:middle line:10%
"The Gold of the Gods,"
and suddenly the story

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:10%
explodes all over the world.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It's an enormously
significant discovery.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Inspired by the
groundbreaking book "The Gold

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:10%
of the Gods" in 1976, Stan
Hall, a Scottish engineer

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:10%
and conservationist led a major
scientific expedition deep

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.240 align:middle line:10%
into the Amazon jungle to map
this mysterious cave system.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The landmark expedition
included a dozen institutions,

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:84%
joint special forces, and
one of the most famous men

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.700 align:middle line:84%
>> One person that took a great
interest in the metal library

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:84%
of the Tayos Caves was the
astronaut Neil Armstrong.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:10%
Presumably, he'd
heard the stories

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:10%
and wanted to come on board
and be a part of the expedition

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:10%
to go down into those caves,
which he did just seven

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:10%
years after being the first
person to step on the moon.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:10%
And along with a team
that was put together

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:10%
by Stan Hall, which
included other engineers,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:10%
it included officials,
it included members

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:10%
of Special services both
from Ecuador and from Britain

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:10%
and from other countries as well
creating this huge great team

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:10%
of about 100 people, one of the
biggest exploration teams that

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:10%
had ever been seen,
descended down

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:10%
into the Tayos
Cave in August 1976

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:10%
looking for these
lost treasures.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a major
story in the 1970s.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Neil Armstrong believes
he can find the Tayos Cave

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and reveal this lost
civilization or this lost

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:90%
history to all of humanity.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:10%
>> The journey to get to
the Tayos Cave is an entire

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:10%
expedition in itself, let
alone even getting down

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.380 align:middle line:10%
into the subterranean chambers.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:10%
You have to first travel up
deep remote rivers in the Amazon

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:10%
jungle, climb through
tangled mountains

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:10%
to get to a cave entrance
that's a 200-foot vertical drop

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:10%
into a subterranean cave system
that supposedly goes miles

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:22.220 align:middle line:10%
and has never been fully
excavated or understood.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The Tayos caves in Ecuador
are located in a very remote

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:90%
region.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.040 align:middle line:84%
They're tough to get to,
but they're absolutely

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:90%
gigantic when you get in there.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.488 align:middle line:10%
These are huge open spaces,
massive galleries where

00:17:34.488 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:10%
you could-- essentially,
they've been

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:10%
described as you could
have whole buildings that

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:10%
have laid down on
their side exist

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:10%
inside some of these caverns.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kilometers
and kilometers long.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:90%
They do exist.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I was at least in a small
part of these tunnels.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
They are definitely cut out
of the rock artificially.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.210 align:middle line:90%
The walls are polished, smooth.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan Hall's team surveyed
possibly about 3 miles

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:90%
of caves.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is invaluable in
itself to actually create

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
a map that's been of
use to expeditions

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.260 align:middle line:90%
that have gone down since.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, unfortunately,
they weren't

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:90%
able to find the metal library.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:21.520 align:middle line:84%
What they did find, however, was
a quite remarkable human burial

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.180 align:middle line:84%
that dated back to about
1,500 BC surrounded

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:84%
by grave goods in
such a position

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that the sun came down through
the opening into the caves only

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
summer solstice

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and hit that actual spot
where the burial had

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:84%
been found telling
us that whoever this

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:90%
was a very important person.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And that these caves,
therefore, meant a lot

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to the Indigenous Shuar people,
the tribal peoples that were

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:90%
the custodians to the caves.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I was writing about these
subterranean caves in one

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:04.900 align:middle line:90%
of my books.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.120 align:middle line:10%
And of course, I was attacked.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Some critics say this is all
rubbish. this is all invention,

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:90%
or I'm a liar, et cetera.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And later I read an article
in a German magazine

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
that Mr. Neal Armstrong, the
first man on the moon in one

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:84%
of these subterranean
caves in Ecuador

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and he said, "This is
absolutely nothing.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing artificial.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Quasi Erich Von
Däniken is a liar."

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "This is impossible.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.730 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.170 align:middle line:90%
I made my photos.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Where was Neil Armstrong?"

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote him a nice letter,
"Dear Professor Armstrong."

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
He's professor at the
university --or he

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.010 align:middle line:84%
was- at the University
of Cincinnati.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And he knew me because of my
books that's why he answered.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I received a
wonderful letter from him.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I have it still in my
archive where he tells me,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.790 align:middle line:90%
"I'm originally from Scotland.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And with this group of
Scottish cave explorers,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:90%
we went to Ecuador.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Our exploring had nothing
to do with your tunnels."

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:84%
He wrote me, he has been
misquoted completely

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:90%
by the press.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
That's sometimes the sorry you
suffer when somebody just makes

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
out a sensation in the press
and tells a story like,

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Neil Armstrong disproved
Erich Von Däniken

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.190 align:middle line:84%
while Neil Armstrong
said, "I'm sorry.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I was never at that place."

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan Hall spent years
studying the Tayos Caves.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
his life, he actually

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:42.710 align:middle line:84%
figured out that he was
looking at the wrong location.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The Indigenous people state
that Neil Armstrong and those

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
groups that have explored the
caves never made it to the true

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
entrance and that the
subterranean cave is so vast

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.090 align:middle line:84%
that the true entrance where
the actual treasure from these

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:84%
ancient cultures around the
world is still being hidden

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:84%
today by those
Indigenous cultures.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The people of that
Amazon region are still

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.790 align:middle line:84%
protecting the true entrance
of that cave and the treasures

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and the secrets within
that cave today.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So those treasures, that gold
library, that metallic library,

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:84%
that evidence of the lost
civilization is still there

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:90%
waiting to be found to this day.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And we need to get back there.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.870 align:middle line:84%
We need to continue to make
this search because this could

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
reveal evidence of the lost
continent of Mu, the lost

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
continent of Atlantis, and
exactly what was going on

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
in our world before we
lost our memory at the time

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.820 align:middle line:90%
of the Younger Dryas.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:10%
>> After Father Crespi's death,
it is said that these treasures

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:10%
were stolen.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
However, the central
bank of Ecuador

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
claims to have all of
Father Crespi's pieces.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What's interesting about
the Father Crespi collection is

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:84%
the story around what
potentially happened to it

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:90%
after Father Crespi passed away.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.080 align:middle line:84%
He had collected a huge
amount of artifacts.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
After his time, this
collection doesn't

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
seem to include some of the more
interesting artifacts, let's

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:84%
say, that have shown
up in photographs that

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:84%
were taken when people visited
his collection while he

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.860 align:middle line:90%
was alive.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.920 align:middle line:10%
>> The unfortunate thing is
that upon the death of Father

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.760 align:middle line:10%
Crespi, his entire
collection was divided up.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it was stolen
by different people.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.380 align:middle line:84%
The most important
artifacts are now

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
located in one or two of the
largest banks in Ecuador.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I had the opportunity
to go to Cuenca in 2015.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
We managed to get access to
two or three different places

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
that had some hidden
in their basements.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:84%
One of them was the
Central Bank of Cuenca.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.340 align:middle line:10%
Another one was in the
basement of the library

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:10%
where they have
hundreds of artifacts

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.800 align:middle line:10%
that were collected and
given to Father Crespi going

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:10%
over the last few decades.

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.700 align:middle line:84%
These actually include elongated
skulls, giant stone pots,

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
you can think of.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.740 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't believe our eyes
that all these stories that

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.840 align:middle line:84%
had been written about
saying all these libraries

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:84%
had been lost, we actually
saw them for ourselves.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
It was incredibly hard to
determine if these were ancient

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:84%
or these were modern fakes,
but the stories and the myths

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:84%
that I know people like
Erich Von Däniken and others

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.200 align:middle line:84%
have looked into over
the years suggest

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.910 align:middle line:84%
there was something much
more profound going on here.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.747 align:middle line:84%
And so people think they're
all lost, but they're not.

00:23:36.747 --> 00:23:37.830 align:middle line:90%
You can actually go there.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you make the
right inquiries,

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:41.235 align:middle line:90%
you can see them for yourself.

00:23:41.235 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Does this collection of
relics preserved by Father

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Crespi point to an even larger
ancient library still within

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:90%
this subterranean wonder?

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And is this the
legendary place where

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
survivors from Mu and
Atlantis congregated

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
to endure one of
the most anomalous

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and turbulent times
in geological history?

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
What other evidence
will be discovered

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:84%
beneath the jungles of Ecuador
to cement this majestic land

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
permanently into the
historical record as one

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:30.380 align:middle line:84%
of the legendary locations
of Inner Earth that allowed

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:84%
our ancient ancestors to
keep the sacred knowledge

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.450 align:middle line:84%
alive to help humanity
rebuild and thrive

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.890 align:middle line:90%
after the Younger Dryas?

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:84%
As mainstream searches for
answers to our most puzzling

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.530 align:middle line:84%
questions, what
other evidence will

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:84%
be uncovered that can
unite all ancient cultures

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and drastically
alter the mainstream

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:04.050 align:middle line:84%
timeline for the rise
of human civilizations?

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:05.838 align:middle line:84%
Looking into the
Lore of the region,

00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it's the
Indigenous people of the Amazon

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
or the ancient Peruvian people
of that region, what we find

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
is that the area of Ecuador
where Incapirca was built

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
location of Tayos Cave

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
was a major meeting
ground for civilizations

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:84%
around the world
as a place to bring

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:84%
ancient artifacts, ancient
texts, and knowledge to one

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.290 align:middle line:84%
single place it could be
preserved so that it can never

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:90%
be lost again.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.360 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Incan as well
as the ancient Atlanteans,

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Mu people,
and all of these

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.730 align:middle line:84%
civilizations that existed
long before the Younger Dryas,

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
they had known
that the Tayos Cave

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most
extensive subterranean caves

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And because of its high
elevation in the Andes

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.780 align:middle line:84%
mountains, it would be protected
from great catastrophes

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:90%
like floods.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.430 align:middle line:84%
This led the ancient
people to take artifacts

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and ancient writings
and bring them

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:84%
to this cave as well as a
place to reside and survive

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.940 align:middle line:90%
these catastrophes.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my thoughts about
this region altogether

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and the connections that comes
from megalithic building is

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.030 align:middle line:84%
that, I think, there
was a builder culture.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So whether this is Mu or
Atlantis or something else,

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
the people that built these
megalithic installations all

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.910 align:middle line:90%
around the world were connected.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
They may not have been
tightly coupled and connected.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It might have been outposts of
a similar civilization almost

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
like cousins because there are
little differences in style

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
from place to place.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's certainly
existed a mechanism

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:42.340 align:middle line:84%
for moving goods around and for
moving styles and iconography

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:90%
from place to place.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And the stuff that we see in the
evidence from Father Crespi's

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.160 align:middle line:84%
collection might be evidence
of just such a thing occurring

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.050 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole story about Father
Crespi and these enigmatic

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
artifacts that start to appear
from within a subterranean

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.210 align:middle line:84%
complex, perhaps a repository
lost from some previous

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:84%
civilization is totally
romantic in many ways,

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:13.150 align:middle line:84%
but it's also very important
for all of us to pay attention

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:84%
to because we're right on
the cusp of making tremendous

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.370 align:middle line:84%
discoveries about
our ancient past.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And it could well be
that the Tayos Cave

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.570 align:middle line:90%
could become a ground zero.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It could be not just one of many
repositories around the world.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
It could, in fact,
be the repository

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
where it's a crossroads
of the East and the West,

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's a place, a
meeting place of the above.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.660 align:middle line:90%
and the below and East and West.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of ancient
history and modern history

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:90%
converge on this one place.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And now we have an
opportunity to open it up.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> What other treasures remain
hidden beneath the subterranean

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:84%
chambers of the Tayos Cave and
the ancient lands of Ecuador

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and may contain the keys we have
to all the lost civilizations

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that existed before
the Younger Dryas?

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We had a prehistoric past,
which was high technology.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can prove it, but
the mainstream science simply

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.050 align:middle line:90%
don't want to know it.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:90%
They don't look at it.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And if they look at it,
it's all speculation.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.970 align:middle line:84%
They find explanations of
it, which are not true.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I am one of these
persons who have

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:84%
been traveling 10,000 kilometers
and 10,000 kilometers.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:84%
On every archaeological place
where I was, I was there.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:90%
I touched the stone.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:90%
I photographed it.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.380 align:middle line:90%
I smelled it.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I learned about the mythology.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the local
archaeology, what do they say.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I make the
combinations worldwide.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I make these comparisons
because I was there.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.727 align:middle line:90%
I saw it with my eyes.

00:28:42.727 --> 00:28:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's the difference.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So although I adore
archaeology they

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.635 align:middle line:84%
are in so many points
definitely wrong.

00:28:50.635 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:10%
>> When we take into
consideration the extraordinary

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.820 align:middle line:10%
artifacts that we find in
Ecuador and now beyond Ecuador

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:10%
and we look at all of the
science that is now revealing

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.670 align:middle line:10%
surprising discoveries
about our past,

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.920 align:middle line:10%
we have to say to ourselves, we
are not what we've been told.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.750 align:middle line:10%
We're so much more than
we've been led to believe.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And that as these
discoveries come to light,

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.780 align:middle line:84%
they tell us beyond any
differences of race, culture,

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:84%
belief, bloodlines,
heritage that we're family.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.450 align:middle line:90%
We're a global family.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And we have a history that we're
only beginning to understand.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's that history
that opens the door

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:90%
to the piece of our future.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.723 align:middle line:84%
And I think we owe it to
ourselves to give ourselves

00:29:38.723 --> 00:29:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and to give our
children the opportunity

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:90%
to know what that history is.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.420 align:middle line:90%
