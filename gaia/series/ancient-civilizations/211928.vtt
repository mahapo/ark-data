00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout modern history,
the moon has been woven

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:90%
into legend and lore.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Most have associated our
moon with strange anomalies,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
psychic phenomenon, and many
other tales from the dark side.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
This natural satellite is known
to control the Earth's tides,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:90%
cycles, and patterns.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:10%
But as the Younger Dryas
period came to an abrupt end,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:10%
and the mighty oceans
continued to rapidly grow,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:10%
many alternative
researchers have

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:10%
pointed to lunar
clues that reshape

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.270 align:middle line:10%
our understanding of
our perfectly sized

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:10%
and placed celestial partner.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Could the brightest and
largest object in our night sky

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:84%
play a much larger role
in creating a balance

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.050 align:middle line:84%
on this new watery planet of
this majestic solar system?

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the greatest mysteries
in our world and our solar

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:10%
system today, is a mystery that
is so obvious that some people

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:10%
simply take it for granted.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:10%
And that is the
existence of our moon.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Our moon is one of the
most mysterious moons

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
in the entire solar system
for a number of reasons.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to look at the
mathematics of our relationship

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
to the moon, what we
find is a precision

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:84%
that exceeds anything that we
would expect to see in nature.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, the distance
between the Earth and the moon

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
is exactly 108 moons, 108
diameters between the Earth

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and the moon.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
This number comes up very
frequently in the Hindu

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and the Buddhist 108 is the
number of beads on the mandalas

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:90%
that are used in the prayer.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And the number is used to honor
our relationship to the cosmos,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.650 align:middle line:90%
and in the cosmology.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're told
in these traditions.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Then you begin to
look even further.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
The distance between
the Earth and the sun

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
is exactly 108 Suns.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Can this be a coincidence, or
is this something that nature

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:90%
would do on its own?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a lot of
interesting facts and mysteries

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:90%
surrounding the moon.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:10%
It's a unique relationship we've
never observed anywhere else

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:10%
in the known
universe, as far as we

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:10%
can tell, a relationship
between a moon and a planet,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:10%
quite like what we
have on planet Earth

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:10%
with our moon today.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Of all of the planets
in our solar system,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
our moon is the largest moon
relative to the planet that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:84%
orbits than any other
planet in the solar system.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Our moon is fully a quarter
of the size of our planet.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a very anomalous object.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:10%
In fact, some of the quotes in
the early days of lunar studies

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.380 align:middle line:10%
was saying it's easier to
explain why the moon shouldn't

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:10%
exist than why it does exist.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:10%
Or all theories of the lunar
origin don't make sense.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And so we're still
confronted with that.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
We're still, I think,
struggling with this idea of how

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:90%
the moon came to be what it is.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:90%


00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
mainstream science,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
there are three prevailing
theories on the origin

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
of the moon.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The first proposes
that the moon and Earth

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.000 align:middle line:84%
were created around the same
time, when the solar system was

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:84%
forming, roughly 4 to
4.5 billion years ago.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The second theory
is that the moon

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
was created somewhere else, and
migrated into our solar system,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.885 align:middle line:84%
and was captured by the
gravitational forces

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:10.685 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.019 align:middle line:84%
The third, and most
controversial theory,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is that there was a
collision between Earth

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:90%
and a protoplanet named Theia.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:84%
The debris from this collision
eventually formed into the moon

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Since the late 1960s,
alternative researchers

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and skeptics of the
mainstream theories

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
remain focused on an
Apollo 12 misfortune that

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
sparked a string of new theories
about the origin, structure,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and purpose of this
strangely perfect sphere.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Apollo 12 astronauts, when
they were leaving the moon,

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
jettisoned their lunar
lander, causing it to impact

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:90%
on the surface.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
It caused the moon
to resonate and ring

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:90%
like a bell for over an hour.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:10%
This shocked NASA
scientists, and they

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:10%
try to replicate that
situation during Apollo 13.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:10%
And so they sent an intentional
impact down to the surface,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:10%
causing it to resonate
for over three hours.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So to put this in a
little bit of perspective,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:84%
if we have a seismic
event on the planet,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
those only last for a
few moments in time.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
>> When the Apollo astronauts
were doing the seismic

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
activity, they created
seismic waves on the surface,

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and the idea is to measure the
amount of time that those waves

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
take to travel from the surface
into the core and come back

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:90%
to the surface.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.670 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, seismic
waves typically

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.120 align:middle line:90%
take maybe two minutes.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.350 align:middle line:84%
When there's an impact,
the term is it will ring,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and it will ring for
maybe two minutes,

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:90%
and then the ringing stops.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:84%
On the moon, famously
the astronauts

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
said that it was
ringing like a bell,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
meaning that the ring continued
long beyond that two minutes,

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:84%
typically around 10
minutes, and in some cases,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:90%
it lasted for hours.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
That is only possible
if those seismic waves

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:84%
are moving through material
as well as empty space

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
or some space that is
less dense that allows

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.740 align:middle line:90%
the propagation of those waves.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
If the material is more dense,
it will soak up those waves.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.327 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the reasons it is

00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:40.910 align:middle line:84%
what is called the
ringing of the moon

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that leads to speculation that
the moon may not be solid.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
hollow, we don't

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
know if it means that it is
hollow like a sphere that

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
is empty inside,
but very possibly

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
beneath the surface,
deeply filled

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
with caverns or possibly
large spaces that are open

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and then other spaces that
become gradually more dense.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Studies from NASA and also
from other space agencies have

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
also shown that there seems
to be gravitational anomalies

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.830 align:middle line:90%
on the moon.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the density of
the moon may not be consistent.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And so potentially you could
theorize that a reason for this

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:84%
might be that there are
cavities in the moon.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.575 align:middle line:90%
It may not be entirely solid.

00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:10%
>> As the discoveries during
the space race surfaced,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.010 align:middle line:10%
writers began weaving
alternative scientific theories

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:10%
with fictional tales, cementing
the mystery of the moon

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:10%
into popular culture.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Four years after the
Apollo 12 mission,

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:84%
British rock band Pink Floyd
released their eighth studio

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
album, "The Dark
Side of the Moon."

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
This iconic album title
influenced millions

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to question why do we never
see the dark side of the moon?

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the ironies that we
see is what is called the tidal

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:90%
lock, T-I-D-A-L lock.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And what this means is that
the rotation of the moon

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:84%
exerts exactly equals one
orbit around the Earth,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:84%
which leads us to only
see one view of the moon.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:84%
No matter where we
are on Earth, we

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
will never see what is called
the dark side of the moon,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:84%
because that rotation
as it's moving

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
is exactly locked into
rotation of our planet.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.320 align:middle line:84%
It looks to us like
the moon is not moving.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.105 align:middle line:84%
No other moon in our solar
system has such a rotation.

00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:55.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The moon's total mass and its
assumed volume and its assumed

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:84%
mass and density are such that
it should have settled out

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:90%
to this form of a sphere.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that a sphere would

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:84%
have a single center of mass,
a single moment of inertia,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
which means that it would be
free to rotate on any axis,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
but that's not what's
happening, because the moon's

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:84%
rotation on its axis is
completely and precisely locked

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.880 align:middle line:84%
in to its period of
orbit around the Earth.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that imply?

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.800 align:middle line:84%
It implies that the
mass of the moon

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
is not distributed
radially symmetrical

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:90%
about its center of mass.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Right there, that's
a huge anomaly,

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
because the moon
should have settled out

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
to a spherical
shape, and then there

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
would be no coupling between the
moon's rotation and its orbit.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
But there is this coupling,
what's called a one-to-one spin

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:90%
orbit coupling.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:90%
So that in itself is anomalous.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:90%
Why has the moon not done it?

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:10%
Well, it implies that something
within the lunar crust

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:10%
is extremely rigid.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>> When the Apollo astronauts
began exploring the surface

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:84%
geologically, even they were
surprised at the results

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
of some of the tests
that they found.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
mysterious factors

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
is the moon obviously has
many craters around it

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:84%
of different sizes, presumably
from different impacts

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:90%
from objects of different sizes.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And you would
expect those impacts

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to go to varying depths because
of the velocity of the impact.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:84%
What the astronauts found
is, yes, the craters

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
vary in diameter, but they
all go to about the same depth

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:84%
as if they are hitting some kind
of a mysterious boundary that

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.188 align:middle line:84%
will not allow them
to go any deeper.

00:11:04.188 --> 00:11:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You can look up at
the face of the moon,

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and you see these gray
splotches on the moon.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Those are called the maria.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
The maria are sort
of like lava plains.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:90%
They're basaltic rock.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:90%
They're circular more or less.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are very
circular, almost certainly

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.250 align:middle line:90%
caused by impacts.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you have a crater
that's, say, 200 miles wide,

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.430 align:middle line:90%
it should be 20 miles deep.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
But on the moon, once you get
to about a three-mile depth,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.898 align:middle line:84%
they continue to get wider,
but they don't get any deeper.

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like you're
trying to throw something

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:10%
against like a
tank or something.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:10%
It's so hard and so resistant
that craters are not

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:10%
excavated to 20 miles deep.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle line:10%
So you've got this
extremely rigid crust,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:10%
which is inexplicable.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:84%
This is really
only the beginning.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
mass concentrations

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that were discovered when
the lunar orbiters back

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
in the early '70s were going
around the moon passing

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:90%
over the Great Maria.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:84%
They would pass over the center,
and as they're going along,

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.340 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden they
dip in their orbit

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:84%
because there was some
tremendous gravitational pull

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
that literally caused
them to deflect downward.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
It followed that
whatever was causing

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:84%
this extreme gravitational pull
had to be near the surface.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of an
object could do that?

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:10%
Well, they came up with
a hypothetical object

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:10%
that would be like
a piece of cast-iron

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.220 align:middle line:10%
like 100 miles in diameter.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:10%
So in other words,
again, it's more evidence

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:10%
that the crust of the moon is
extremely strong and extremely

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:10%
rigid.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:90%
What are these mascons?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> As astonishing
synchronicities around the size

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and orbit of the moon drive
alternative researchers deeper

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.960 align:middle line:84%
into the mystery, evidence is
mounting that this anomalous

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:84%
structure in our night sky is
even stranger than fiction.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The evidence now strongly
leads to the proposition that

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:21.355 align:middle line:84%
there is a fourth possibility
for the origin of our moon

00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:23.730 align:middle line:84%
in addition to the three that
are accepted in traditional

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
science and that is the
possibility that the moon is

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:84%
an artificial body intentionally
engineered either in place

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
or brought from somewhere
else a long time ago.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:84%
When we begin looking at the
mathematics of the moon itself,

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
this is where we know beyond any
shadow of a doubt that nature

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.040 align:middle line:84%
cannot provide for the
circumstances that we see

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:90%
in the moon today.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the orbit
of the moon itself,

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:84%
typically the moons
that orbit the planets

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system, they
orbit at the equator.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Our moon is offset
exactly 6.7 degrees

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.060 align:middle line:84%
from the equator, which
happens to be precisely

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
the location that is
required to stabilize

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the rotation of our Earth
so that it doesn't wobble,

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize the tides and
the rhythms that allow life

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to be as it is, both marine
and terrestrial life as it is.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:84%
If the moon were
not there, we would

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:90%
have a more erratic orbit.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:84%
We would have exceedingly
erratic tides, very high tides,

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
very low tides, and
differing times,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.505 align:middle line:84%
not the rhythms
that we see today.

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look up at the
moon, we really don't know what

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.450 align:middle line:10%
But when the ancients
looked up at the moon,

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:10%
they looked at it
as something that

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:10%
was brought here intentionally.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, what if we just
speculate and think, well,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.700 align:middle line:10%
what if the moon was brought
here with the intention

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:10%
to calm down the planet?

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think
about what happened

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.320 align:middle line:84%
during the Younger Dryas,
the cataclysmic beating

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:90%
that the Earth took.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:84%
It was going to
require something

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:84%
to calm down the seas, calm
down the volcanic activity.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:84%
What if that's what the
moon was brought here for,

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.370 align:middle line:84%
as this stabilizing force
so that civilization

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
could ultimately
come to a plateau

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
but then also
flourish afterward?

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> If there was a time of
no moon and then a moon was

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:84%
created to stabilize the
energies of the Earth,

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.960 align:middle line:84%
what we do know is the moon
not only controls the tides

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
but controls the
underground waters as well.

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And if they're going out
of control in an impact,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of end of
the world situation,

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to be jarred
from the inside out as well.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:10%
So if the moon was
placed there, it

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:10%
was to regulate not just the
surface waters but the waters

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:10%
beneath the Earth themselves.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I think they could
have been going out of control.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Imagine tidal waves from
the inside of the Earth

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.990 align:middle line:84%
as much as from the
outside of the Earth.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:10%
>> In our exploration
of the Younger Dryas,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:10%
we talked about how it could
have begun and what kind

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:10%
of catastrophes that
befell our planet.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:10%
But what about its end?

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:10%
What brought it to
such an abrupt end?

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's turn our eye back
to this Galactic Federation,

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
a force so powerful, that
had technology so strong

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
that it could destroy an
entire planet as big as Tiamat.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.840 align:middle line:84%
What if they looked
upon our planet,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
saw the destruction that had
been raging for over a thousand

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.400 align:middle line:84%
years and said, OK,
we need to stop this.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to bring some
peace back to this planet.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:90%
How would they intervene?

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
What would they do to
mitigate the catastrophes that

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
were happening upon our planet
during the Younger Dryas?

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And Swaruu tells
us that as a result

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:84%
of the explosion of Tiamat,
the whole solar system

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:90%
was thrown into disarray.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:84%
This caused an imbalance to the
Earth's orbit and axial tilt,

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
resulting in a great
number of catastrophes.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
help, the Federation

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:84%
placed one of their
artificial biospheres

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
into Earth's orbit right
into the perfect location

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to counterbalance the disarray
and stop the catastrophes.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Failure to stabilize
the Earth would

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
mean that our planet would
enter a more elliptical orbit,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:84%
creating a completely
uninhabitable environment.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Several traditions throughout
history after the Younger

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Dryas, like the druids in
Europe and the pagan practices

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in Rome, have legends
of moon ceremonies.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
These rituals aided
in locking the moon

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
into the misunderstood
categories of witchcraft

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.180 align:middle line:90%
and magic.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But what about the time when
the Atlantean empire was rapidly

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:84%
colonizing the planet
over 12,000 years ago?

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:84%
How different was this
planet, the rituals,

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:20.465 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient sky
before the Younger Dryas?

00:18:20.465 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
There is little doubt that the
moon has an extreme influence

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.130 align:middle line:84%
on the water of the
planet, but what

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:36.140 align:middle line:84%
if this planet wasn't completely
covered with water yet?

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:10%
Scientist and author
Hans Schindler Bellamy

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:10%
illuminated carvings
from Tiwanaku

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:10%
in Bolivia that were
believed to have been created

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:10%
before the Younger Dryas and
the current moon was in place.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we look at
structures in Tiwanaku,

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.550 align:middle line:84%
we see carvings that
talk about the moon.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.360 align:middle line:10%
On the calendar gate, we have
a very interesting inscription

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:10%
that seems to suggest that a
smaller planetary body once

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:10%
circled around the Earth
before the moon we see now

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:10%
was put into place.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We have cultural traditions
that speak to a time before

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:84%
the moon was in our orbit,
all the way from Indigenous

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:84%
traditions, even
biblical traditions.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of Job, Job
25:5 speaks to a time

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:84%
when the moon did
not shine, when

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:90%
the moon was not in the sky.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Other Indigenous traditions
tell the same thing.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Are they preserving a
memory from their ancestors

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that are telling
us in the only way

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
they know how, without the
writing on the pages of a book

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
per se, but they are
preserving a memory

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.675 align:middle line:84%
of some time in the Earth's
history when we had no moon?

00:19:51.675 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout ancient mythology,
there have been several lunar

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:90%
deities.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Greek poet Homer,

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the region now known as Greece
was once called Arcadia.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
The inhabitants of
that ancient land

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
are referred to as both the
Arcadians and Athenians.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Could the legends passed
down from this civilization

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:84%
provide more clues to
a time before our moon

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:27.500 align:middle line:84%
was in its current position
and a new goddess emerged?

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Selena is the name of the
moon that was given to it

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:10%
by the people in
classical times,

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:10%
by the Greeks and by the Romans.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
reference to the people

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
who were devoted to her, who
were said to have existed even

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:52.550 align:middle line:84%
before the time that the
moon existed in our sky.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And these were the Arcadians,
the people of Arcadia.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were said
to have been around

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
before the moon itself
actually rose into the skies.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.370 align:middle line:84%
We could be talking
about the peoples that

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
existed before the time
of a major cataclysm

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.750 align:middle line:84%
with the most obvious one
being the Younger Dryas.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.560 align:middle line:10%
And I think that this brings
us certainly in the right area

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:10%
that we should be
looking for answers to do

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:10%
with these pre-Selenite
people, in other words, those

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:10%
that existed before the
current moon shone in the sky.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:10%
>> In 43 BC, Ovid writes that
the Arcadians are older than

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:10%
the moon.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So now we're coming up
into the time of Jesus,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
where they're still talking
about this possibility

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
of a civilization, the
Arcadian civilization that

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
existed or is
older than the time

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
before the moon was
in Earth's orbit.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:84%
200 years after Aristotle,
we have Apollonius of Rhodes.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.170 align:middle line:10%
He's a librarian at the
Library of Alexandria.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:10%
He has access to all
the world's knowledge,

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.170 align:middle line:10%
including texts that were
supposed to exist from the time

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:10%
before the flood.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And he also believed that
the Arcadians lived in a time

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:90%
when there was no moon.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.700 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that
they are accepting this idea

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that the moon is something
new to human experience.

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at ancient
civilizations recording

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
the existence of the moon, one
of the earliest examples that

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
we see is what's called
the Disk of Nebra.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:10%
It's dated about 4000
BP, 4000 before present.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And it actually shows
the moon itself.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:90%
It shows the solstices.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the first
examples that we're seeing.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations before
this time do not

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
appear to be recording the
existence of the moon, at least

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.390 align:middle line:90%
as we know it today.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence as well
in these ancient traditions

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that the moon has not always
been at the location in space

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
as it is, that it
was actually closer

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
to our planet at one point and
now has moved further away.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:84%
All of this contributes
to the possibility

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:84%
that this is not
a natural object,

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that it is somehow an
ancient, engineered object.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In mythology, we have a
guy with the name of Enoch.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.190 align:middle line:10%
Enoch was taken away by
the extraterrestrials

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.900 align:middle line:10%
into their mother spaceship.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:10%
And there one of the
extraterrestrials

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:10%
says to the human, human,
look out at the window.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:10%
Do you see this little
light out there?

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:10%
You humans call it moon, but
the moon has no light by itself.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:84%
The moon receives his
light from the sun.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And then he explains
why the moon sometimes

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.780 align:middle line:90%
is full and half.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, simply this
statement, Stone Age time,

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.070 align:middle line:84%
is a proof of
scientific information

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:84%
because no human could
have known the moon has

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:90%
its light from the sun.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.730 align:middle line:84%
You can prove simply
by a few phrases

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that there was an
extraterrestrial influence.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Like the legends of the moon,
extraterrestrial influences

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
have also been mislabeled
and misunderstood.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But there are several
stories throughout the ages

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:84%
where those from the
stars helped humanity

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.830 align:middle line:90%
in various ways.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Swaruu tells us that the moon
is emitting a radiation field

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:90%
around our planet.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the scientists
will refer to this

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:84%
as the Van Allen
Belt. Scientists today

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:84%
will tell you that this
Van Allen Belt of radiation

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.930 align:middle line:84%
is caused through the
interplay of the sun

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and the magnetic
fields of the Earth,

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:46.630 align:middle line:84%
creating this electromagnetic
field around the Earth.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Swaruu gives us a
different perspective.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.710 align:middle line:84%
When we look to the moon as
part of a way of mitigating

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.160 align:middle line:84%
the catastrophes of
the Younger Dryas,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Swaruu tells us that the moon
is emitting the Van Allen

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Belt as a means of increasing
the density of the planet.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, regardless
of what you think

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.690 align:middle line:84%
about what the Van Allen Belt
is, it is a measurable field.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:90%
It is detectable.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:84%
It is proven by science
that it is there,

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
but what is it
really doing for us?

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>> When we think about all
that we know about the moon,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:84%
remember, when we
landed on the moon,

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.390 align:middle line:84%
it rang like a bell
for three hours.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And we went back to the
moon and intentionally

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:84%
crashed a spaceship
into the moon

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.570 align:middle line:90%
just so we could measure this.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:10%
That is a dramatic
moment in human history

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:10%
because it compels
us to look back

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:10%
at these ancient myths,
what Ovid was saying,

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.940 align:middle line:10%
what Anaxagoras, what
Aristotle, what Plutarch,

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.100 align:middle line:10%
what all these Greek
philosophers were saying

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.140 align:middle line:10%
about a previous
civilization that existed

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.290 align:middle line:10%
before the moon was
in place, and now we

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:10%
get this very technological
description of the moon.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
It's hollow like a spaceship,
like some kind of a Death Star

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:90%
perhaps even.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the picture that's
now being painted of the moon,

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and in one instance, you
look at that and you think,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:90%
this is terrifying.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking about,
what kind of a civilization

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.660 align:middle line:84%
has the power to bring the
moon and put it so perfectly

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:84%
in place, but then on the
other side, if you look at that

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and you think, wow, what
kind of a civilization

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:90%
has the power to do that?

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
They must love us
so much that they

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:84%
put the moon in the exact
place that it needed

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to be for Earth to
become stable once again,

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.285 align:middle line:84%
and we are the benefactors
of that action.

00:26:29.285 --> 00:26:33.640 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the moon has
played a significant role

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.610 align:middle line:84%
in our history, and I think it's
absolutely deserving of a lot

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:43.180 align:middle line:84%
more study and open-minded
interpretation of some

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient legends about it.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we owe it
to ourselves to go back

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:84%
to the moon and do the
experiments with the best

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.560 align:middle line:84%
science of the modern world
so that we can tell ourselves,

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
truthfully, honestly, factually,
is our moon a natural moon,

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:84%
or has it been created
artificially by an intelligence

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that placed it there
for our benefit?

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what does
that mean for us today?

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:90%
