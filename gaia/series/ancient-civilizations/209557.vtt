>> High in the Andes in South
America sits the majestic Lake

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:90%
Titicaca.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:84%
Embedded in myth,
this body of water

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
is unlike any other
on the planet.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:84%
This legendary lake is
12,507 feet above sea level

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and is 118 miles in
length, straddling

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.090 align:middle line:90%
the border of Bolivia and Peru.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:84%
According to mainstream,
before the Inca Empire,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
the Tiwanaku Empire
rose to power

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
around this area of South
America between 550 and 950 AD.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.810 align:middle line:84%
The sacred site, now
known as Tiwanaku,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
is considered one of the largest
ancient prediluvian sites

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Stretching over
two miles, this is

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:84%
home to several
mysterious structures

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
that have puzzled researchers
and archaeologists.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:84%
There are foundations
and carvings

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:84%
with powerful connections
to Easter Island.

Under the water
of Lake Titicaca,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
ancient ruins remain buried
under roughly 4 to 6 feet

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
of silt. Megalithic stones
are scattered around the lake

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
as if they were
thrown like pebbles.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
What was happening in
this mysterious area

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.250 align:middle line:84%
long before the lake began
rising from the never

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
ending storms and cataclysms
during the end of the world?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most mysterious
places in the Southern Andes

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:10%
of Peru is Lake Titicaca.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a mysterious
lake and geologically,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
it's fascinating because there
was a time that this lake was

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
at sea level and the
marine life, in the water,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
at the time, in the
lake, was from sea level.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And when the mountain-building
episode occurred and the Andes

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.180 align:middle line:90%
rose--

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:90%
and this lake rose with it--

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.400 align:middle line:84%
it captured whatever life was in
this area, made it into a lake,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and now that life, hundreds
of generations, thousands

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
of generations later,
have become unique life

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:84%
forms that you don't see
anywhere else in the world.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:84%
They're their own unique
genre of life forms.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So lake Titicaca today, it sits
at 12,000 feet above sea level.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest navigable
lake in the world today.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
It is a hotbed for
mysterious lights

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
in the skies that enter and
leave the water of the lake.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:84%
The Indigenous people say
it's their ancestors that

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
are coming and going.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not surprised
that it is near this lake

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:10%
that we find where the most
mysterious archaeological sites

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Tiwanaku-- it is a
large complex that

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
is made of essentially
three separate areas.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the largest of these
is a platform called Pumapunku.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And it is on this
site where we find

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
some of the most mysterious
aspects of Tiwanaku, itself.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Lake Titicaca is the
highest lake in the world

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:10%
and it's basically been off
limits to archaeologists.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:10%
I mean, diving in Lake Titicaca
is very dangerous business.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
until April of 2019

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
that divers were able to dive
to the bottom of Lake Titicaca

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and they made some
incredible discoveries.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:84%
They found some
pre-Inca artifacts

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that had been intricately
carved and they readily

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
recognized that
these were offerings

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:90%
that were given to the lake.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
To the Incas, Lake
Titicaca was supernatural.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:90%
It was mysterious.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:84%
It was a place where humans
could connect with the gods.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And the very fact that they
were ultimately and finally

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
able to dive down and
make this discovery

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
suggest that perhaps Lake
Titicaca has even more secrets

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.800 align:middle line:84%
to reveal and that maybe now
is the time for those secrets

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.195 align:middle line:90%
to start to unravel.

00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> In the center of the Tiwanaku
complex is the Kalasasaya,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.250 align:middle line:84%
which translates
to Stopped Stones.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Within these walls
stands a monument called

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Puerta del Sol, meaning
Gateway of the Sun.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.980 align:middle line:10%
The sophistication of design
around the prediluvian megalith

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:10%
further promotes a knowledge and
understanding of our universe

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:10%
far beyond our
current understanding.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:10%
Just in front of the Kalasasaya
is a subterranean temple named

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:10%
Kantatallita, also referred
to as Temple of the Moon.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Adding more mystery to the
Tiwanaku temple complex,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
the Akapana Stepped
Pyramid Mount

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
stands roughly 59
feet tall and appears

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to have been massively destroyed
from its original shape.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Another powerful ceremonial
site right next to Tiwanaku

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
is Pumapunku, which translates
to Gate of the Puma.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Modern legend from
Tiwanaku is full

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
of tales from the Inca Empire
and how it rose to power

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:90%
between 1438 to 1533.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But what about the cultures who
didn't desire to rise to power,

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.660 align:middle line:84%
didn't need to call
any land their own,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
the cultures who were
trying to connect

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.710 align:middle line:90%
the above with the below?

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
How many of those
cultures have inhabited

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.625 align:middle line:84%
these mysterious lands
before the Younger Dryas?

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Tiwanaku is a
huge city, complex,

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:10%
that consists of a number of
very important architectural

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:10%
features.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:84%
You have this massive courtyard
known as the Kalasasaya.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And next to the
Kalasasaya, you've

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:84%
got this sunken courtyard
that's orientated northwest

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
with these walls that have
these human heads carved

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
in stone as tenants, all of
them, all very different.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And this structure
is very clearly

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
the oldest of all
of them because it's

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
on a different alignment
to everything else

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
and may well have been present
hundreds, if not thousands,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.420 align:middle line:84%
of years before the rise of
the monuments that we see.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The problem with this is that
there was a much older culture

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
that occupied the site.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Their monuments are beneath
those of what we see today.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at Tiwanaku,
we can look at it from a couple

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:10%
of different perspectives,
from the architecture, itself,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:10%
and from the information
encoded into the architecture.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:84%
The architecture,
itself, is astounding.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:84%
What we find in
Tiwanaku and Pumapunku

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:84%
are stones that are created
with such precision,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
beyond what can be done
with machines today.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:84%
The mysterious H-shaped stones
that interlock like Legos--

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
each stone is created
with absolute precision.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was not done
with hammers and chisels,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:90%
we know this with certainty.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
We begin to find joints
of these stones that

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:84%
are carved or poured,
perhaps, with such precision

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that you can't even slip a piece
of paper in between the joints.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And the mysterious series of
perfect 6 millimeter diameter

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
holes, evenly spaced
all along the stones,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
suggest that these
stones may have

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
been used for something
even more than what we see

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:90%
and use today.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:84%
They were obviously
used for an astronomical

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:90%
site and astronomical marker.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:84%
And this comes into
play because when

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:90%
we ask, how old is Tiwanaku?

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:90%
There are many theories.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:10%
One of the theories
that was developed early

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:10%
in the 20th century is that
the site, different places

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:10%
within the site, are oriented
toward the sun and solstice

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:10%
markers.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.870 align:middle line:10%
The problem is that it
is slightly off based

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.240 align:middle line:10%
upon where the sun is today.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:10%
And if we were to realign
the sites with the sun

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:10%
to make these markings as
precise as everything else,

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:10%
it means that we
would have to go back

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.930 align:middle line:10%
in time between 12,000 and
17,000 years before present.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Now that's
controversial in terms

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle line:90%
of traditional archaeology.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:84%
However, it fits
perfectly into what

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in
other ancient sites,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:84%
from Egypt, and from
North America, from Caral,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:90%
in Northern Peru.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Many other sites we're talking
about prediluvian sites.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about sites that
were built during the Ice Age

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
or in the warming periods
within the Ice Age

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:84%
that were subject to the
conditions of the ice melting

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
or of the torrential rains that
happen from the weather pattern

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
changes at the melting
of the Ice Age.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Tiwanaku and Pumapunku
are located in the same place

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:10%
on the Altiplano of Bolivia.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.550 align:middle line:10%
They once stood right next to
Lake Titicaca, many thousands

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:10%
of years ago.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:10%
Now the thing is they've
raised in elevation, hugely,

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:10%
from where they probably were.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:10%
So how did this happen?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:10%
So there's a big
story that there

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:10%
was some kind of
cataclysm that took place

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.855 align:middle line:10%
at Tiwanaku and at Pumapunku.

00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:10%
And you can see this
when you go there.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:10%
You can literally
see stones are being

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:10%
flung around, many of
these multi-ton stones,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:10%
probably up to 100
tons, some of them.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
They'd just been
knocked out of place.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:90%
So what could have caused that?

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't know, but it looks like
it was some kind of tidal wave,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.470 align:middle line:84%
possibly in Lake
Titicaca when there

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:90%
was huge shifts in the land.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Viracocha, according
to local traditions,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.340 align:middle line:10%
he appears in Tiwanaku
after a global catastrophe.

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:10%
Now here's the problem
with this story.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:10%
The fact is that there
are different building

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:10%
methods in Tiwanaku and
it's very obvious for anyone

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.320 align:middle line:10%
who's been there.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
There is a very early
primordial period.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a second
building period.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a rebuilding period
as though the place has

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.970 align:middle line:84%
been completely devastated
by a catastrophe,

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:84%
like the whole of Lake
Titicaca just emptied

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
onto the city of Tiwanaku,
and someone came after it

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.490 align:middle line:90%
and rebuilt it.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my understanding,
that's the moment

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.680 align:middle line:84%
when Viracocha and his group
of people suddenly appear.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So he was coming back to rebuild
something that was already

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:90%
established in that era.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And according to some of the
archaeological discoveries

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:84%
at the area and
also the alignment

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
of the temple at Tiwanaku,
there is a suggestion

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
that the place is much,
much older than the flood.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Researchers of ancient
civilizations are enamored with

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:43.580 align:middle line:10%
the idea of a lost civilization
in the Pacific, Lemuria, or Mu,

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:10%
and then of course, Atlantis.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And they wonder, is it possible
that they met in Tiwanaku?

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
The reason for this
speculation comes

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
from a book published in
1945 by Arthur Posnansky,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.850 align:middle line:84%
from an archaeoastronomy
perspective.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:02.600 align:middle line:84%
This corresponds perfectly
with the time frame

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:90%
of Plato's Atlantis story--

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis was a civilization
that existed 9,000 years

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:90%
before Plato's time.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:10%
When we look around Tiwanaku, we
find incredible stone buildings

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:10%
that match other stone buildings
that researchers are dating

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.100 align:middle line:10%
to the Atlantean time period.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:10%
Plato expressly stated that
the Atlantean buildings were

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:10%
made of red, black,
and white stone,

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:10%
and that's exactly what we
find at Tiwanaku, confirming

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:10%
this possibility that Tiwanaku
is an Atlantean civilization,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:10%
possibly.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Now that opens up
again this idea

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that, perhaps,
the people from Mu

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
were able to then
travel over to Tiwanaku

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and meet the Atlanteans.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And we find, therefore, a
confluence of these two highly

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.750 align:middle line:90%
enigmatic civilizations.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Arthur Posnansky, known
for his strong personality

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.350 align:middle line:10%
and exotic ideas,
was a former officer

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:10%
for the Austro-Hungarian Navy,
who also worked nearly 50 years

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.150 align:middle line:10%
on his archaeological
quest to uncover the truth

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient Andes.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
His book, "Tihuanacu-- The
Cradle of American Man,"

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
dates the building of
Tiwanaku to 15,000 BC.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:10%
His controversial ideas
have opened the doors

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:10%
for alternative researchers
to explore the fringe

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:10%
of Andean archaeology.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Posnansky talks about
the Kalasasaya courtyard,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
in which is this very famous
monument which is known

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:90%
as the Gateway of the Sun.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And what he said is that
the Kalasasaya is orientated

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:90%
specifically east-west.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Nothing strange about that.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.280 align:middle line:10%
But that the corners
of the Kalasasaya

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:10%
were the rising
points of the sun

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:10%
at the time of the solstices.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:10%
So that's the summer solstice
and the winter solstice.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:10%
And the points that the
sun rises at solstice

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:10%
changed across a
period of 41,000 years,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:10%
only by a few degrees.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And although this
might not tell us

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
exactly how old the structure
is that we see today,

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.570 align:middle line:84%
what it tells us is
that there could well

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.960 align:middle line:84%
have been a foundation
on that spot,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and that's very, very important.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if that's
so, that's evidence

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:90%
of a lost civilization.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The work of Arthur
Posnansky, in the early 1900s,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.910 align:middle line:84%
put the date back
to 17,000 years.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Now this was dated on very
precise archaeoastronomy

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.460 align:middle line:90%
of the Kalasasaya Temple.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:10%
Basically, if you stand in the
specific spot of the temple--

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.520 align:middle line:10%
this is the huge
rectangular temple,

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.300 align:middle line:10%
which has the huge monoliths
that form this kind of almost

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:10%
like a square around it.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:10%
If you look towards
the east, you

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:10%
can actually
observe the movement

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.200 align:middle line:10%
of the sun over the
whole solar year, going

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:10%
from the extreme solstice to
the other extreme solstice,

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:10%
like the winter to the summer.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:10%
And in the middle, the middle
stone would mark the equinox.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Also if you just
look at the site,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:84%
you look at the
lichen on the stones,

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:84%
you look at the way they're
extremely weathered,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
the ones that have
been above the surface,

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.102 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the
destruction there,

00:15:23.102 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
it looks like something
that's been there

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:90%
for 20,000 or 30,000 years.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely incredible.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Posnansky said there's
something about these temples

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:10%
that suggests an even
older period, least of all,

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:10%
because the semisubterranean
temple nearby was not

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.840 align:middle line:10%
semisubterranean at all.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:10%
It's only semisubterranean
because the mud that's

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:10%
been built up around it--
because of the deposits laid

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.990 align:middle line:10%
by Lake Titicaca--
made it subterranean.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And for that, requires
over 10,000 years

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:90%
of flooding and reflooding.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And during my time there,
I've made the observation

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that the temples around
the Kalasasaya quadrangle

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
offset by 3 degrees, which means
that these three temples are

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.290 align:middle line:84%
looking at the horizon
in a completely

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:90%
different period of time.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:10%
So let's take Posnansky's
quadrangle measurement,

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:10%
15,000 BC as you benchmark.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:10%
You add 20,000 years to allow
for the tilt of the Earth

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:10%
to have moved 3 degrees.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:10%
That gives you 36,000 years.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.740 align:middle line:84%
And it fits into
the scheme of where

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
the Tiwanakun culture
and the Egyptian culture

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%
may have been forming
part of the same group

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:84%
of global civilization
at that particular time.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:10%
>> The evidence that Tiwanaku
is aligned with the stars is

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:10%
a powerful prediluvian clue,
but several other mathematical

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.600 align:middle line:10%
messages present an
even stronger connection

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:10%
to the god's technology.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So we talk about
the information encoded

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.730 align:middle line:90%
into the temples.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
In Tiwanaku, we have
to talk about what

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.750 align:middle line:90%
is called the Gate of the Sun.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
This is a fascinating
single piece of stone

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that is carved
approximately 10 feet tall

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:07.599 align:middle line:84%
and there is a figure in
the center with a face,

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:90%
and the navel is very present.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:16.359 align:middle line:84%
When we draw a line from
the navel, at the center,

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and we draw that line down
to the base of the door,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:84%
we have a perfect
golden triangle.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
If you were to draw a line
underneath the rectangular

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
windows, about midpoint,
and you draw the lines,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.470 align:middle line:84%
you have another
perfect golden triangle.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you transpose
the Vitruvian Man

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.710 align:middle line:84%
from Leonardo da
Vinci's work, where

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:84%
you see with his arms
outstretched and his legs,

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
showing all of the
body proportions

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and the Phi ratio proportions
of sacred geometry,

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
if you were to
superimpose that up

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
on this particular
monument, what we find

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.870 align:middle line:84%
is innumerable
intersection points

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
between the human
body and the marks

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and the sites that
are on this stone.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So clearly we're
looking at architecture

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
which is extraordinary, but
within the architecture,

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.650 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at an
information system that

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
was left without writing for
those that would understand how

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:84%
to decode these sacred
proportions that apply

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:84%
to all life, that apply to us
and apply to our relationship

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:90%
to time.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
The mathematics
that we see encoded

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.680 align:middle line:84%
into the Gate of the
Sun, in Tiwanaku,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
these are precisely
the mathematics

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
that we see encoded
into some of the most

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
ancient and sophisticated
temples remaining in the world

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
today, from Saqqara in
Egypt to the Giza Plateau.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
We see them throughout
Northern Europe.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.860 align:middle line:84%
We see them even in the
sites the Mesoamerican sites

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.370 align:middle line:84%
that we find, such as
Chaco Canyon and Caral.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a universal language
that transcends words.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
It transcends
writing because it's

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
based upon the universal
principles of the world we

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.015 align:middle line:90%
live in and nature, herself.

00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>> This sacred land, nearly 2
and 1/2 miles above sea level,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:84%
holds foundational evidence,
providing links back

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to the precision of building
found in ancient Egypt.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Pumapunku, believed to
be a pyramidal structure,

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is a site that mostly
remains buried and is

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.530 align:middle line:84%
a deeper mystery to
researchers and archaeologists.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Could this potential
pyramid be another clue

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that this area was visited and
influenced by prediluvian gods?

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
What other trails
of evidence did they

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
leave for us to lead
future generations

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.695 align:middle line:90%
to these sacred sites?

00:19:42.695 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Pumapunku is really quite
unique when it comes to design,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:84%
shape, style, and also
the types of stone,

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
because we have two
main types of stone.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
We have the
sandstone, which comes

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.840 align:middle line:84%
from about eight miles away
from a quarry to the south.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:10%
This is very rich in
iron so it has these kind

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:10%
of magnetic qualities.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And the main stone
used there is andesite.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a very hard
type of volcanic stone.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:10%
And this comes from
Cerro Khapia, which

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.170 align:middle line:10%
is a mountain on the
other side of the lake,

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.970 align:middle line:10%
and it's around 50 miles away.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And so there's actually a trail
of stones from the quarry,

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.400 align:middle line:84%
at that mountain, all
the way, across the lake,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:90%
all the way to Tiwanaku.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And these are called the lazy
stones or the tired stones.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.470 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they've been
dropped there deliberately

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:84%
by the builders to mark
this ancient sacred route,

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.535 align:middle line:84%
bringing the stones from their
sacred birthplace at Cerro

00:20:41.535 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Khapia.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:10%
>> At Pumapunku, for
example, the stones were cut

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:10%
into modular geometric shapes
that remind the use of precise

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:10%
technological system.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:58.770 align:middle line:10%
But how did the men of the
time cut such hard stone so

00:20:58.770 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:10%
precisely?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:10%
So according to experts,
this is possible

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:10%
only using precise
advanced devices.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:10%
It is also remarkable
that the builders

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:10%
used metal staples to fix the
stones, putting them together.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:10%
And I believe this is a further
evidence of a building plan,

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:10%
very sophisticated.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:10%
So the clues of an
advanced technology

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.810 align:middle line:10%
that was used to build
Tiwanaku and Pumapunku that

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:10%
are witness of an ancient
civilization living on Earth

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:10%
before the great flood.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> When we leave Pumapunku
and the incredible H blocks

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
and look around, we find
corresponding examples

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:46.210 align:middle line:10%
The incredible Osirion, behind
the Temple of Seti at Abydos,

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:10%
features these massive, or
cyclopean, red granite blocks

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:10%
that are perfectly
fitted together.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
You can hardly slip a razor
in between the joints,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:90%
yet there's no mortar.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests a capability,
a manufacturing capability,

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that was known not only at
Pumapunku but also in Egypt

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
The natural question
that emerges

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
is, how is it possible that
both of these cultures separated

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
by oceans had the same type
of advanced machining ability

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:90%
to work with these stones?

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.980 align:middle line:84%
There must have been
communication with them

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and it could possibly
be that they are in fact

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:90%
the same builders at each site.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Tiwanaku and Pumapunku both
display very sophisticated

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.820 align:middle line:90%
engineering and knowledge.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.810 align:middle line:84%
But the question remains,
who were the builders?

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The first civilization in
coming to Bolivia and Peru--

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:10%
all the territory
that I remember

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:10%
with the name HarinMibu
was the territory

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:10%
under the power of Mu.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:84%
The Mu civilization
was basically

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:84%
like the keepers of all
this coming from the skies,

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.040 align:middle line:90%
in all the Pacific Ocean.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So they were the builders
of the basis for them

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to come, to have the
meetings, to have

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.170 align:middle line:90%
the trespass of information.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And Tiwanaku was one
of these special spots

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:19.860 align:middle line:84%
where all the energy of the
planet was flowing through.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:10%
There was a main difference
between the Mu civilization

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:10%
and the Atlantean.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.250 align:middle line:84%
The Mu civilization
was much more

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:84%
connected with the
flow of everything,

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.840 align:middle line:84%
much more connected with
the energy of the things.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And the Atlantis civilization
was much more mathematical

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and trying to understand
the patterns that

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:90%
creates everything.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there are
two types of building there.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
The basements that
are from the Mu time--

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:84%
they didn't make
temples in Mu time.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:90%
They just did the platforms.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:90%
It was all open.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the Atlanteans came and
built temples on the top of it.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantean civilization
used to build these three

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:84%
main gates, everywhere, in
every one of their colonies.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Because where the gates
for certain stars,

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
in certain moments
of the year, that

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
would open the specific
information from those stars.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So the people, in those temples,
in certain moments of the year,

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%
they would become the stars
through those portals.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:42.150 align:middle line:84%
The part of Mu in Tiwanaku,
it would be all missing

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.810 align:middle line:84%
just a few blocks
on the ground that

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:50.700 align:middle line:84%
hold what was once
the main base of those

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.130 align:middle line:90%
who came from the skies.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So nothing really to
be able to be seen.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything is much more covered
by the Atlantean civilization

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
that built the doors,
that built everything.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But you can still see some
of the Mu civilization

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.390 align:middle line:84%
in some parts along
the entire Pacific.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Do the prediluvian sites
around Lake Titicaca connect

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:84%
with some of the oldest ancient
civilizations on the planet?

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And were they constructed
by the Mu civilization,

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.920 align:middle line:84%
only to be rebuilt
by the Atlanteans

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:84%
before and after
the great flood?

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
As with most cultures that
rise to the empire level,

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:84%
the elders and leaders are
highly protected and informed.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Could these powerful
empires that

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
have occupied these sacred
sites around Titicaca

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:84%
have had access to legendary
information passed down

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:90%
from the prediluvian gods?

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Did they know the legends of
Zep Tepi, the Anunna, Sumer, Mu,

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:90%
and Atlantis?

the early elders believed
was their gift from the gods?

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Were they searching
for these sacred places

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to be used in their
efforts to control?

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Or did they believe they had
found their new home to connect

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient knowledge,
designed and built

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:26.410 align:middle line:90%
