00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Planet Earth.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.150 align:middle line:10%
According to radiometric
dating, this planet

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:10%
is roughly 4.5
billion years old.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Modern day scholars
claim that civilization

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:84%
began roughly between
5,000 and 6,000 years ago.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Geological records show that
severely erratic weather

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
patterns were present on
the planet roughly 12,000

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:10%
Countless myths and legends
from around the planet

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.210 align:middle line:10%
depict a time of
complete chaos that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:10%
destroyed all civilizations
on the planet.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:90%
The deluge.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.600 align:middle line:90%
The cataclysm.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:90%
The event.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:90%
The end of the world.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Along with these great
fables, ancient sites

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:84%
like Gobekli Tepe in
Turkey, Easter Island

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
in the South Pacific, South
America, Giza plateau, Japan,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
and India contain a level
of sophistication and design

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that baffles the minds of
scholars and scientists.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Most of these sacred
sites have foundations

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
composed of stones weighing
in excess of 30 tons that

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:90%
defy our human understanding.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
If civilization only happened
roughly 5,000 to 6,000 years

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.510 align:middle line:84%
ago, then who built these
foundational wonders

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
in prediluvian times that
were designed to survive

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:90%
the end of the world?

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And what were those
beings who inhabited

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
the Earth long before
the flood trying

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about our
connection to the cosmos?

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
We turn to science for answers
to help unravel the mystery.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But when we look below the
surface, the laws of physics

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:84%
appear to have been mastered
long before humanity

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.785 align:middle line:90%
began to figure them out.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Science is a living body of
information that's not static.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:10%
It's not fixed.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.680 align:middle line:10%
It's designed to be
constantly updated when

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:10%
new discoveries come to light.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got to incorporate
those discoveries

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
into the pre-existing
scientific story.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:84%
We're writing a new
story right now.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:10%
We have to because
the evidence no longer

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.500 align:middle line:10%
supports the story of the past.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:84%
The evidence no longer
supports the theory

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
that civilization for
example, began between 5,000

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:90%
and 5,500 years ago.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
The evidence no longer supports
that civilization's rise

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
has been linear that we began
with primitive settlements

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and primitive ways
of building society

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and have gradually come
to where we are today

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:90%
in a linear fashion.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So when we're thinking
about our past,

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:84%
we have to constantly
update the story.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:10%
There is a continuity in
the stories that cannot be

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:10%
dismissed.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
One of those continuities is
the story of the great flood.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
This is where our
new story begins.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:10%
>> So when we're talking
prediluvian times,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:10%
do we mean antediluvian?

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
Because diluvian means the
deluge, the great flood,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:90%
and pre of course means before.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But when we say antediluvian,
it is ante as in anterior,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:84%
in front of, the anterior
chain of your body.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we say
antediluvian it is

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.720 align:middle line:90%
in front of the great deluge.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we say prediluvian
and antediluvian,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.780 align:middle line:84%
we know that this is the time
period before the great flood.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.955 align:middle line:90%
They're one and the same.

00:04:00.955 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:10%
>> In the beginning, after a
great devastation according

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:10%
to the Sumerian texts, the
gods came and manifested humans

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:10%
again.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme that
we see repeated many times

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
in many cultures
all over the world,

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
creation of humans.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
There was a massive flood,
and the Earth was repopulated.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
That's reflected in the
Babylonian texts and the Hebrew

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
text and the Egyptian texts.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:84%
They all mention
something similar.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:10%
>> When you do a deep survey
into the myths from around

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:10%
the world, you actually find
that there are two different

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:10%
flood narratives that happened.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And so in the very
first flood narrative,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:84%
it talks about a dark
world or a beginning

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:90%
and the end of an age.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this cataclysm
and this flood occurs.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And the individual
escapes the flood

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
with the 7 sages,
the 7 Abigails.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, it is the
beginning of this golden age

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:90%
and this new period of time.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:84%
With Noah flood, there's
civilization that is occurring

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and the flood
happens because they

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.440 align:middle line:84%
are trying to wipe
out the wickedness

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
from on the planet, like you
find in the biblical narrative.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And Noah survives the flood
and there's no mention

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:90%
of these 7 sages or 7 Abigails.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.530 align:middle line:10%
>> So in South America we have
the tradition of Viracocha,

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:10%
who was a builder God had
suddenly shows up mysteriously

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:10%
after a global flood
wiped everything out.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:10%
And he appears in
specific locations

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:10%
with a group of
seven specialists.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:10%
They're experts in their fields
because wherever civilization

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:10%
appears on the face of
the Earth after the flood

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:10%
there is always one
charismatic leader who

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.590 align:middle line:10%
leads seven craftspeople,
experts in their field.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Throughout the ages in
mythology and spiritual

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:10%
traditions, there are several
common themes that keep

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:10%
repeating.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient cycles
encoded in nature

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
as well as embedded
in myth remind us

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that if we are to
survive on this planet,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
we must be prepared
to change and adapt.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There are common themes
that run through all of these

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:90%
stories.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:10%
One of those themes
is that civilization

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:10%
is cyclic rather than linear.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
That there have been previous
cycles of civilization

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that have lasted for
approximately 5,000 years.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Something happens, those
cycles come to an end,

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:90%
a new cycle begins.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:84%
This is where it gets
really interesting.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Because even though
the cycles change,

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:84%
there appears to be a
continuity of knowledge,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
a continuity of wisdom when
it comes to the end of one

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.965 align:middle line:84%
cycle in the
beginning of the next.

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:10%
The Mayans divided
one precession

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:10%
of the equinoxes,
the 26,000 year cycle

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:10%
approximately into five
5,125 year long cycles.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:10%
Each of those cycles
when they begin something

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:10%
happens to the civilization
during that time.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And one of the questions
that historians have asked

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
is, could there be something
that drives these cycles?

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Is there a cosmological
phenomenon?

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:90%
Is there a climactic phenomenon?

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Is there a geologic phenomenon?

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a convergence
of all of these phenomenon,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:84%
something happens
every 5,125 years.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we take
the year 2012 is

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
the end of one 5,125 year long
cycle and we go back in time

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to the 5,000 years
previously, this

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
would be the time
that we traditionally

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:84%
have been taught that
civilization began in,

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:90%
5,500 years ago.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, new discoveries are
revealing the remnants

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
of ancient civilizations that
predate that 5,000 years many,

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.185 align:middle line:90%
many times.

00:08:23.185 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that's
echoed in the ancient stories

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:10%
around the world, whether or
not it's Plato talking about

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis or the ancient
Egyptians and the Temple

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:10%
of Sais is that we find that
they discuss how these events

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:10%
have come in many
different ways.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.909 align:middle line:84%
They discuss how
the civilizations

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
have been destroyed from
periods of great flooding,

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:90%
but also extreme heat and fire.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
about one thing,

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
it's about a totality of all
of these different catastrophic

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:84%
events that have led
to the disappearance

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and destruction of these
predeluvian civilizations.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we have
the telltale evidence

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of these
ancient megalithic structures

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
from the predeluvian
civilizations

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:84%
they left behind is that we find
what's known as vitrification

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:90%
on the surface.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not it's
Egypt or Peru or Turkey.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is
that those granite blocks

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.540 align:middle line:84%
in the quartz that
was in them literally

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.178 align:middle line:84%
melted from such an extreme heat
event that in order to do that,

00:09:20.178 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to have temperatures
on the surface that would

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:90%
have exceeded 2,000 degrees.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Researchers and mythological
heroes on a journey have long

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
looked to the sky for answers
to explain what happened

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:90%
in the past.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But most spiritual traditions
and mythical journeys

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
carry core messages
that inspire us to also

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:90%
go within to find our answers.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Starting in the
early 20th century,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:84%
scientists have been
studying ice core samples

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
from the polar regions of
the planet from 1989 to 1995.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
The Greenland Ice Core
Project conducted experiments

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
climate patterns

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
in that area for approximately
the past 100,000 years.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Again, in 1998, the
collaborative ice drilling

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
project at the Russian Vostok
station in East Antarctica

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
uncovered the
deepest ice core ever

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:84%
recorded revealing climate
data for approximately

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:90%
the past 420,000 years.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Then in 2017, an ice core
taken from the blue ice

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.600 align:middle line:84%
field in the Allen
Hills of Antarctica

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:84%
revealed ice dating to
roughly 2.7 million years old.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.230 align:middle line:84%
These studies provide geologists
with a clear understanding

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
of the cyclical nature of
Earth's climate and weather

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Geologists refer to the
past and current epics

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
as the Pleistocene
and the Holocene.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The Pleistocene epic began
about 2.8 million years ago.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is the sheets
of ice that we often

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.260 align:middle line:84%
talk about covered North
America, the Greenland Northern

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Europe.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:84%
That period, that epic,
ended about 11,500 years ago

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.710 align:middle line:84%
as we began the current
epic that we're in now

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:90%
which is called the Holocene.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.900 align:middle line:84%
However, when we go from
one epic to another,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:84%
it's not a clean break,
there's a transition period.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a buffer between
the two and that buffer

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.650 align:middle line:84%
is the mystery that helps us
to understand what happened

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:90%
in these ancient civilizations.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:10%
Between 12,800 years ago
and 11,600 years ago,

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:10%
that little window of time is
an extraordinary period of time

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:10%
that geologists call
the Younger Dryas.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:10%
There are plant species
that only exist in cold.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:10%
One of those plants
is called the Dryas,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:10%
and this is where the term
the Younger Dryas comes from.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
There is evidence
of the Younger Dryas

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:84%
far down into North America
and down into Northern Europe

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that these
were cold temperatures

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:90%
during this period of time.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And when the temperatures
began to warm,

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
the plants disappear
from that period of time.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
In the late Pleistocene,
the time of the ice,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:84%
the Ice Age peaked about
20,000 years before present.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And the temperatures
began to warm.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:90%
The warming melted the ice.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Then something happened that
is a mystery to this day.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:84%
The warming stopped
and all of a sudden

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:90%
the temperatures dropped.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
They plunged about
5 degrees Celsius

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:84%
over the entire
Northern Hemisphere.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And in that shift
the temperatures

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
plunged for a period of
time about 1,200 years.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many theories
around what caused these

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:84%
drastic climate changes of
the Younger Dryas period.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the prevailing theories
is named the Clovis comet

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:84%
hypothesis, claiming that
fragments of a large asteroid

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:01.020 align:middle line:90%
or comet struck the planet.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Another theory involves
a cataclysmic event

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.820 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system, currently
between Mars and Jupiter,

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
is what is referred to
as the asteroid belt.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Throughout antiquity, numerous
astronomers and researchers

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
have speculated that this is a
result of a previously existing

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:90%
planet that was destroyed.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:10%
In the ancient Babylonian
cuneiform text,

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:10%
the Enuma Elish,
this watery planet

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:10%
described as being similar to
Earth is referred to as Tiamat.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Throughout history,
this mysterious planet

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle line:84%
has been given other names such
as Planet V, Phaeton, Maldek,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:90%
and Moloch.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:84%
If there was a planet
that was destroyed,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
could some of the debris
from that massive explosion

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
have fallen to Earth
creating massive changes

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.590 align:middle line:90%
to the balance of our planet?

00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Recent evidence has revealed
that Earth was hit multiple

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
times during this period of time
with something from the cosmos.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It is believed to be a
comet for this reason.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.370 align:middle line:84%
If it were an
asteroid, the asteroid

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:84%
would have a single impact
that would be more localized.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.540 align:middle line:84%
But what we're finding
is that whatever

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:84%
it that was coming into Earth's
atmosphere was fragmented

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and it broke up and scattered
across multiple continents

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The mineral platinum,
for example,

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
is relatively rare on Earth,
but you find it in comets.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.450 align:middle line:84%
As far as south as
South Africa, there

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.490 align:middle line:84%
are remnants
fragments of platinum

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
from this comet breakup
that matched those that

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:90%
are found in Northern Europe.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
A large crater has
been found in Greenland

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:90%
for precisely the same time.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at the theories
of what triggered the Younger

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Dryas, it may be that the
impact of the comet and the heat

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:84%
generated by that impact,
thousands and thousands

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.880 align:middle line:84%
of degrees, created a rapid melt
to cool the water in the North

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Atlantic.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things we find is
that ocean levels dramatically

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:84%
rose from before the predeluvian
period of 13,000 years ago.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And we know that looking at
geologic and climatological

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:84%
records, whether or
not it's ice cores

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.720 align:middle line:90%
or looking at geologic evidence.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that
during this time period,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:84%
we had glaciation in North
America and in Europe

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.320 align:middle line:90%
where we had massive ice caps.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So when we combine cataclysmic
events in our solar system,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.870 align:middle line:84%
as mentioned in the Enuma Elish,
with massive amounts of rain

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:84%
as well as melting
of the ice caps,

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.280 align:middle line:84%
all that water flooded
into the ocean,

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:84%
raising sea levels
up to 400 feet,

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.760 align:middle line:84%
flooding and submerging
ancient cities and structures

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The Atlantic Ocean is home
to the global conveyor belt.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Starting from the surface
water around the North Pole,

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
this circulation system pulls
water from the North Pole

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and cycles it all
throughout the planet.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we're looking at the
mystery of the Younger Dryas,

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.520 align:middle line:84%
what we know for certain is that
there was a dilution of fresh

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
water in cold water that changed
the thermohaline properties

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.790 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean conveyor
of the Atlantic.

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.880 align:middle line:84%
We know that because of the
proxies and the temperature.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:84%
The mystery is,
what single factor

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
or what multiple
factors may have

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.910 align:middle line:90%
contributed to that cooling?

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:10%
The meltwater from North
America, from the ice melting

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.860 align:middle line:10%
was behind a large ice wall.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence shows
that ice wall broke.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And when it broke, there
was a tremendous onslaught

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
of that cold water, a
massive flood in a relatively

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:90%
short period of time.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
What may have triggered
that could have

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.545 align:middle line:90%
been the impact from the comet.

00:16:50.545 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> As the mystery
continues around the origin

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
of the deluge, what can
ancient mythology tell us about

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:84%
the changing relationship
between humans and the gods

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.109 align:middle line:90%
around these chaotic times?

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
>> Prior to the flood, there
is this global narrative that

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:90%
occurs.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And the stories are
extremely consistent

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.770 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the culture
that you're looking at.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Post-flood, it changes into more
local myths or the perspective

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:90%
of the myths change.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:84%
In the earlier myths it's
the stories of the gods.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.130 align:middle line:84%
They're vying for power
with each other and fighting

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're part of the
action of the gods.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Once the flood happens, it
becomes stories of humanity

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and their connection
to the gods.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just a really
big change that happens.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:10%
>> One thing that is starting
to crystallize among researchers

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:10%
of our ancient past, especially
the pre-flood times is

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:10%
the number of
places, of temples,

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.020 align:middle line:10%
that are rebuilt on
previous temple sites.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We find this in Egypt,
we find it at Stonehenge,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:90%
and we also find it at Dwarka.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And what this suggests
is that the ancients knew

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:84%
of the original locations of
temples in the pre-flood times,

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.830 align:middle line:84%
marked those locations,
and then after the flood

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:84%
or after this great
cataclysm returned

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.380 align:middle line:90%
to those exact same sites.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that there
is something inherently

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:84%
special about Dwarka and
some of these other sites

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that was known to either the
ancient gods that inhabited

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
it or they passed this knowledge
along to humans prompting them

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild on these
specific sites.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that the Ice Age
essentially ended about 12,000

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.450 align:middle line:90%
BP, before present.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But what is often missed is
that when the Ice Age ended,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
not only did the
ice continue to melt

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
but there was a tremendous
shift in the climate.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And with this shift
in global climate

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:90%
comes a shift in local weather.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
The shifts in the
weather were called

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:84%
unsettled weather
patterns that lasted

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:90%
approximately 4,000 years.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:10%
So beginning from 12,000
years BP, before present,

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:10%
to 8,000 years BP,
this was a period

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.150 align:middle line:10%
where Earth saw torrential rains
in some places, extreme drought

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:10%
in other places.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:10%
And with those torrential
rains from the storms,

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:10%
torrential erosion that left
impacts and effects that we're

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:38.250 align:middle line:10%
still seeing today that impact
not only archeological remains

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:10%
and remnants of
archeological remains,

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:10%
but also the landform itself.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>> This mysterious time in
history continues to challenge

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:84%
mythologists, scholars,
and scientists.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:10%
From the erosion patterns
around the Sphinx

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.690 align:middle line:10%
in Giza to the sunken cities off
the coasts of Japan and India,

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:10%
water has played a major role
in the evolution and destruction

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:10%
of civilizations on this planet.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.410 align:middle line:10%
When we begin to study the
sites around the world that

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:10%
were built before
these great cataclysms,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:10%
archeologists
continue to discover

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:10%
that they were built
with a purpose that

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:10%
is beyond our understanding.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:10%
Powerful clues point to a
strong cosmic connection

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:10%
with the builders
and the locations

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.040 align:middle line:10%
of these archeological
wonders leaving

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:10%
behind carved
connections linking

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.040 align:middle line:10%

over the planet.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is where we get
to the work of David Talbott,

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:84%
who noticed around the Younger
Dryas period that there were

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:84%
some major cataclysmic
electrical events going on all

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:45.930 align:middle line:90%
over the planet.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
That there were these
plasma discharges

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
that could be from solar
flares or other form

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.060 align:middle line:84%
of celestial activity
causing these plasma bursts

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:90%
throughout our atmosphere.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And they noticed that
the Mohenjo-daro,

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
they recorded those exact same
shapes of those plasma bursts.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't stop there.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.850 align:middle line:84%
There are petroglyphs
all over the world

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:84%
with the same exact
shapes telling us

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that this was a worldwide
plasma event that was documented

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and recorded by
countless cultures,

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
including the people of Easter

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:10%
and all through
Mesoamerica, there

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:10%
was a knowledge of
our relationship

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:10%
to the cosmos that
exceeded anything

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:10%
that's been known in history
until the mid 20th century.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:84%

throughout alignments with

their ancient sites.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:90%
The two go hand in hand.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It was looking to the
Earth for her energy system

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and looking to particular
constellations.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think the river

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.210 align:middle line:84%
the river that
flows from Orion--

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.580 align:middle line:84%
especially Orion
is the focus point

similar, if not the same
