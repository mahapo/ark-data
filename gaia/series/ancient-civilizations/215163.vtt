00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Woven through the legends,
from ancient India and Egypt,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:84%
are tales of wise masters who
reached a state of consciousness

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:84%
that defied the laws
of human understanding,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
with halos and rainbows,
accompanying the depictions

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.760 align:middle line:90%
of these ancient masters.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:10%
These supremely
enlightened sages

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.050 align:middle line:10%
were believed to have
activated a mysterious aspect

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:10%
of themselves, known
as the light body,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.060 align:middle line:10%
often mistakenly compared
to other spiritual aspects

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:10%
of human consciousness, such as
the causal and astral bodies.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The light body or
rainbow light body,

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:84%
as referred to in
Tibetan traditions,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.820 align:middle line:84%
stands apart as
being the culmination

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:90%
of all spiritual aspects.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.780 align:middle line:10%
But what is the
mysterious light body,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.365 align:middle line:10%
and how do humans activate it?

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:10%
>> In many of the ancient
mystery traditions,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:10%
there is a longstanding practice
and cultivation, if you will,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:10%
of what is called
the light body.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're talking from
the ancient Tibetan systems,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
the Kabbalistic systems,
the Egyptian systems,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:84%
so many ancient
traditions were all

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:84%
working to achieve
this body of light.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was a
practice that needed

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
to be developed that was, over
time, through the practices

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
traditions, they would

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
develop more and more strength,
more and more mastery, more

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and more control
within this light body.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like an enlightened state,
that they could shift into.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:10%
>> What exactly is the
concept of the light body?

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:10%
I think that the best way
that we can explain it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.920 align:middle line:10%
is to look towards Tibet.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:10%
Because there was a tradition
there of the high lamas,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:10%
achieving a state of what was
known as the rainbow body.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:10%
And this was the way that they
were able to, quite literally,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:10%
translate their bodies from
a physical, material sense

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:10%
into that of a
metaphysical state.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they could
quite literally disappear out

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:90%
of physical reality.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
It was said that
the lamas would know

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
when they were going to die, and
that they would then prepare,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
go into a hermetically
sealed room.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And they would give
instructions that they were not

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.690 align:middle line:90%
to be interrupted in any way.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And what they would then do is
go into a deep state meditation,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and quite literally, will
themselves out of reality,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:84%
to the point that they were no
longer present inside that room.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Afterwards, when somebody
would finally, open the door,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.680 align:middle line:84%
the only thing
that would be found

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:84%
would be the remains of
their nails and their hair,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
quite literally, that
which was already

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.915 align:middle line:90%
dead before the process began.

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Between the mid-1990s
and the mid 2000s,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:10%
I had the opportunity to lead
groups into some of the most

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:10%
isolated and remote places,
including high on the Tibetan

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:10%
plateau.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
My understanding, from the monks
and the nuns, when I was there,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
was that this is a
one time experience.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
It's not something you go back
and forth from a light body,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
back into this body, but
it is a full immersion,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
where the physical body
literally begins to disappear.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And the goal is to not separate
the body from the spirit,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
rather to infuse the biology
with the spirit to such a degree

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
that the biology
is transfigured.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It is transformed into light,
returning to the energy

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:90%
that we all came from.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.090 align:middle line:10%
>> The light body is
functionally linked

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:10%
to or connected to
the rainbow body.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
The light body is not a
natural part of human beings.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:10%
It actually represents
one of the highest

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:10%
stages of spiritual evolution
for human beings on this planet.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
The light body, in relation
to the rainbow body,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
emerges when there is a
fully functional, long term,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.585 align:middle line:84%
or permanent alignment
of inner unity.

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Ultimately, the rainbow light
body of the Tibetans is resonant

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.420 align:middle line:10%
with, if not,
interchangeable with,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:10%
the Christian concept of
the Resurrection body,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:10%
the glory body, or the
light body of Christ.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.020 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same state.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
This is why, in his
resurrected form,

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Christ is shown on
top of a rainbow.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow is symbolic
of that state of being.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And in all of the world's
mythological, spiritual,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
religious traditions,
there's an allocation.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
There's descriptions
of this state of being.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
They all describe this as the
ultimate human attainment.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>> In the ancient
Egyptian traditions,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.280 align:middle line:84%
they looked at humans from the
dense physical body into this

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
eternalized light body, and that
their soul there would emerge

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.430 align:middle line:84%
out as this light body, if they
had truly achieved that state

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment or
awakening, if you will,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.390 align:middle line:84%
through the practices
during their life.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Then as the body
dies, they can then

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
transform into the body of light
and join the gods in eternity.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is exactly
going on here?

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Can we find the technology
involved with this?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And is the key to
understanding it

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
looking at the sarcophagi
in ancient Egypt?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Could it be possible that
the ancient Egyptians were

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
able to perfect this
process, where either in life

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:84%
or, certainly, in
death, they were

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:84%
able to translate the
body from a physical form

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.553 align:middle line:90%
into a metaphysical state.

00:07:06.553 --> 00:07:10.050 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout ancient history,
several light body activation

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
teachings were likely destroyed,
but the teachings that survived

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
remained within the libraries
of secret societies to preserve

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge and keep
it circulating through

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:90%
the collective consciousness.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:10%
Charles Musès, a mathematician
and esoteric philosopher,

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:10%
wrote several books
throughout the 1900s,

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.680 align:middle line:10%
using various pen names
such as Mussios and Musaios.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric teachings
found within these books

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
contain wisdom about
spiritual metamorphosis

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and the power and purpose
of light body activation.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Muses' book,
The Lion Path,

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:90%
was released in the mid '90s.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And in this book,
he starts to decode

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest alchemical
works ever conceived, which

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
are the casings of the shrine
of King Tutankhamun's mummy.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:84%
The exterior of these
tombs show, for example,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Tutankhamun in his Krast
body, spelled K-R-A-S-T.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the ancient Egyptian
term for the resurrected light

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:90%
body form of Osiris.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:10%
And he shows how there's
the star of Sirius,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:10%
with three beams
of light entering

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:10%
into the third eye of the
pupil form of Tutankhamun.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:10%
And Muses points out that the
hieroglyphs that accompany it

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:10%
are the symbol for star,
the hieroglyph for star,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:10%
and the determinative
for walking.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:10%
And he says, this is
portraying Tutankhamun

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:10%
going through a stargate.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, for me, it said,
this is Tutankhamun

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.820 align:middle line:90%
becoming a star walker.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:10%
Musès was way ahead
of anyone in terms

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:10%
of connecting the ancient
Egyptians with light body

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:10%
transformation, the
opening of stargates,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:10%
and the understanding of our
body, as the stargate itself.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the
pyramid as a stargate.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
We talk about external
portals, but really, it's

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:84%
our body that should
be the focal point.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's an idea that's
really original to Musès.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea that the ancient
Egyptians may have had a process

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:10%
to achieve a state of light body
is something that was looked

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:10%
at in The Lion Path.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:10%
It suggested that a series
of different factors

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:10%
were brought together,
including the use of sound,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:10%
the involvement of
light and photons,

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:10%
including the use
of certain plants.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And that the bringing
together of all three

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of these within ritual
practices would, in some way,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:84%
affect the inner workings of the
body, perhaps on a neural level,

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
perhaps on the level of the
DNA and the way it affects

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
the growth of both
body and mind,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps even on
a quantum level.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And that this would
begin to allow the body

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:84%
to transform like a chrysalis,
evolving into a butterfly,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and that we would quite
literally gain light wings.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And what he pointed out
was that on the inside

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.350 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egyptian
coffins were wings.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Wings were, presumably, for the
soul of the spirit to adopt,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:84%
once they entered into this
astral state, a permanent state,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
where you could quite literally
transform into a light body.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:10%
>> In The Lion Path by Charles
Musès, also known as Musaios,

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:10%
he describes the transmutation
into a body of light,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:10%
like the life stages
of a butterfly,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:10%
meaning the unawakened
individual is like the larva,

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:10%
awaiting transmutation.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But they can move into the
pupal stage, where they surround

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.540 align:middle line:84%
themselves with a chrysalis
or a cocoon, which

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
is like a tomb or a womb, where
they can emerge into the world

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
as a fully awakened, fully
enlightened being of light.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
We see this reflected in the
Egyptian funeral chamber, where

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
the mummies wrapped up,
just like the larvae wrapped

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.890 align:middle line:84%
in silk, which then is placed
inside a coffin or a sarcophagus

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:84%
that has the folded wings of
the pupa or the larva waiting

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.730 align:middle line:90%
to emerge.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens
is the individual who

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:84%
goes through this process
now can sail right

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
through the Bardo stages,
which, as Tibetan lore tells us,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.815 align:middle line:84%
are the stages
right after death.

00:11:52.815 --> 00:11:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And the individual moves
through those stages

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
because they have this
heightened state of being,

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:84%
this enlightened
state of being, where

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:84%
they are no longer subject to
the interruptions we call death.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:10%
>> So we often see the mummy
wrapped up was a chrysalis,

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:10%
and we often see a
hawk head on the mummy,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.650 align:middle line:10%
showing it's turning into
something with wings.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So it was a definite idea
of a chrysalis turning

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
into something, which winged
meant able to traverse

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:90%
more dimensions.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
A caterpillar is
effectively one-dimensional,

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
crawls along
branches, just lines.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And it goes from one
dimension into three.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the most natural
thing for a caterpillar

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:90%
to become a butterfly.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.687 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't,
something is wrong.

00:12:35.687 --> 00:12:36.630 align:middle line:90%
A gland is tied off.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So we become, we change, but
we change in subtle ways.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not a
physical transformation,

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:90%
as it is with the caterpillar.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a consciousness
transformation.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.160 align:middle line:84%
So we gain new abilities, new
perceptions, new insights.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So this was the idea,
and Egypt preserved it.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Muses was insistent that
we're going to discover lost

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.250 align:middle line:84%
secrets of our
neurosecretory system,

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to learn how to
switch on neural networks that

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:84%
have lain dormant or have
been awaiting an activation.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.920 align:middle line:84%
We'll further discover the
secrets of the pineal gland

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:84%
as a manufacturing plant of
the sacred secretions that

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
contain the secrets
of transmuting

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.040 align:middle line:90%
our bodies into light.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what is
happening around the world now.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people, for
the first time in history,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
are practicing yoga,
meditation, doing breathwork,

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that is all aimed at triggering
pulses of these hormones that

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:84%
can heal the body, help us enter
into elevated states of bliss

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and joy, even open portals
in our consciousness

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:84%
to enable interaction with
star walkers from other worlds.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So what Musès was
saying is that we

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
would learn how to become
star walkers by activating

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:84%
these latent capabilities within
us, both in the pineal gland,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.990 align:middle line:84%
as well as in these
neural networks, that

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
would trigger the activation
of our light body.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Drunvalo Melchizedek,
author of The Ancient Secrets

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:10%
of the Flower of Life books,
also has a program called

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:10%
the School of Remembering, where
he gives various techniques

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:10%
and practices for raising
the vibration of the soul,

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:10%
for moving yourself into
a higher state of being,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:10%
which we can think of as part
of activating the light body.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I, suddenly, got
something very deep,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:10%
that the body is just light,
and that there's some connection

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.050 align:middle line:10%
between what you think
and what you feel.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And looking at some
of these practices,

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.180 align:middle line:84%
we can't help but wonder
if these are a continuation

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
of the teachings of the
order of therapeutae,

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:84%
the teachings of Imhotep brought
forward into modern times.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Because Drunvalo
Melchizedek and Imhotep

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:90%
are both students of Thoth.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are bringing this
ascended wisdom to the world.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Both of them are teaching
us how to reach inward,

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
to tap into these practices
and these techniques,

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
to raise our frequency to
an ascended state of being,

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:90%
to activate the light body.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2001, Lawrence
Gardner's groundbreaking book,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Lost Secrets of the Sacred
Ark, examined the power

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and production of monatomic
gold in ancient Egypt

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and the practice of creating
bread or manna for the pharaohs

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:90%
that contained monatomic gold.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:84%
This sacred cone-shaped
cake was thought

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
to promote longevity, provide
access to alternate densities,

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:90%
and feed the light body.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:10%
But the question remains--

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:10%
what biologically
happens inside the body

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:10%
of the pharaoh, when they
ingested this mysterious bread.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the monatomic
gold was a useful element

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
in the activation
of the light body.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Not only did it trigger
the light body activation,

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
but it gave us
more time in order

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
to effect this
transformation as well.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And this was something
that was very important.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we need
this amount of time

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:84%
in order to learn how to
operate our star walking body,

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
how to understand
the light body,

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.280 align:middle line:84%
how to trigger it,
and then, ultimately,

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.490 align:middle line:84%
how to be able to, on command,
phase into our light body.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Lawrence Gardner's work,
really, was a catalyst, for me,

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.030 align:middle line:10%
to look differently at the
alchemical path and journey

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:10%
and the purpose behind it.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Monatomic gold is
something that has

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:84%
a fundamental shift on our
own molecular structure

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.140 align:middle line:90%
within our bodies.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.660 align:middle line:10%
And combining with
the four elements that

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:10%
combine to make our adenine,
thymine, guanine, cytosine

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.770 align:middle line:10%
pairings, and then
uracil and transfer RNA,

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:10%
combining with adenine,
the combination of this,

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.180 align:middle line:10%
along with phosphorus, is
able to make for us what

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:10%
I would call the holy
water or the water that

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:10%
is the structure within the
icosidodecahedron that gives us

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.410 align:middle line:10%
perfect 180 degree
dihedral angles, that

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:10%
has light embedded within it.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:84%
That light water or
aqua sanctus luminous,

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.530 align:middle line:84%
the water that is
of the sacred light,

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
is what activates this
higher order of our DNA.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:23.099 align:middle line:84%
And monatomic gold
plays a fundamental role

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
in the consumption of that,
plays a fundamental role for us

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to be able to realize this next
evolution of the human story.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Our DNA is pretty phenomenal.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Traditional science is
still just scratching

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
the surface of what they
understand about the DNA.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.600 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, there was a Scientific
American article published

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:90%
called Electric Genes.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists were
studying the current--

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:84%
the flow of current
through the DNA.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
They attached on either
end of one of the strands

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
in a double helix,
some ruthenium atoms.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I think they were just using it
as little electrodes to be able

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:84%
to measure the current
running through the DNA,

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.293 align:middle line:84%
but rather than what they
were expecting to see,

00:18:11.293 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
amount of current,

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:19.420 align:middle line:84%
they ended up seeing 10,000
times more flow through the DNA

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:90%
than what they're anticipating.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible that the
presence of these mono-atomic,

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
these single atoms of one of
these platinum group metals,

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
whether it be gold or platinum
or ruthenium, could it be,

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that if we're ingesting it,
possibly, these are then

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:84%
attaching themselves to
the end of DNA strands

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and then creating a
higher flow, almost

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:84%
like a superconductive state
of energy flow of light

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:90%
and electricity through the DNA.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The production of monatomic
gold is often associated with

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:90%
ancient Egypt.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:84%
The felines, essentially,
introduced human beings

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to the mysteries of
monatomic elements

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and had a number of
educational centers,

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:84%
where the creation of monatomic
gold was a primary focus.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, when you
transmute conventional gold

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.820 align:middle line:84%
into a monatomic state,
it loses 44% of its mass.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.860 align:middle line:84%
The question is, where does
the 44% of the mass go?

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.480 align:middle line:84%
The answer is into light, into
a high frequency form of light.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
referred to this light

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.230 align:middle line:90%
as light dimension.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The evidence is mounting,
that the pharaohs and ancient

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
initiates used the monatomic
elements of gold to access

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:84%
different densities
of consciousness.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But a deeper look into the
particles emitted by the sun

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
provides a clue into
the subatomic structure

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:90%
of this mysterious light body.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We know the sun is emitting
all sorts of particles,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
especially a ton of photons
that we see as visible light.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.650 align:middle line:84%
But it also has another
particle that it

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:90%
emits called the ignitons.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Now these ignitons, as they
are emitted from the sun,

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:84%
have a massive amount
of energy, have

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:84%
a massive amount of
information that hit the Earth,

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:90%
and we absorb them.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:84%
When we absorb
these ignitons, they

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:84%
entangle with our own
photons, creating biophotons.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:84%
They also increase
the electrical voltage

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:84%
of our neurons, increasing
our processing speed

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and raising our
level of awareness.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:84%
As you bring the heart
and the mind into unity,

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:84%
you are absorbing more
of these ignitons.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They are starting
to connect and work

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
with the photons of
your natural body,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.400 align:middle line:84%
moving it into this
higher state of existence.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So the basis of
light body activation

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
increased absorption

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
of ignitons, which
provides the quantum

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:84%
energy our bodies need
to hold an increased

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.640 align:middle line:90%
state of photonic energy.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:10%
>> In modern science today,
there is some discoveries coming

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.775 align:middle line:10%
forward, talking about
something called ignitons.

00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Igna being from ignis,
the Latin word for fire.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.620 align:middle line:10%
And this particle is one
of the smallest particles,

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.510 align:middle line:10%
very similar to neutrinos, but
neutrinos don't have any charge,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:10%
so they don't interact through
the electromagnetic forces.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:10%
They're not based on quarks,
so they don't interact

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:10%
through the strong force.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.080 align:middle line:10%
They're very light,
almost no mass,

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:10%
so they don't interact
through gravity.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's only one
force of the four physics

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
forces called the weak force,
that neutrinos interact through.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:10%
So the ignitons are proposed
to be very similar to neutrinos

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:10%
in that sense that they're
weakly interacting,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:10%
but they're smaller.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:84%
They're based on consciousness,
so it's like a particle or unit

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
quanta of consciousness that
we can actually draw to,

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.050 align:middle line:84%
as it comes through
us from the sun,

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%
but we can begin to accumulate
it within our own energy body.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Through ancient
spiritual practices,

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:16.080 align:middle line:84%
through meditation, through the
development of the light body,

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:84%
we actually start to attract
more of these ignitons

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to us, more of this
secret fire to us.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And it cultivates
within and becomes

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.820 align:middle line:90%
what develops our light body.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
We actually become
more illuminated.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
More biophotons
emanate out from us.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:84%
More amplification of
our field, as a result.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENLGISH SPEECH]

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone, absolutely everyone
naturally emits biophotons,

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:90%
even if it's in small amounts.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:84%
These particles, these
biophotons, superphotons,

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.270 align:middle line:84%
can be detected by
current technology,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:84%
even though their existence
was predicted decades ago.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors' ancient cultures
had a very clear awareness

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:84%
of the existence of
these superphotons.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:10%
Tibetan monks initiates
with abilities,

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:10%
such as telepathic
communication, pyrokinesis,

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:10%
and levitation exhibited
these qualities

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:10%
due to the intense
emission of superphotons.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:84%
To achieve these
extraordinary abilities,

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:27.010 align:middle line:84%
we need to increase the
production of these biophotons.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
This can be achieved through
consistent, high-quality

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
meditation practices, or certain
spiritual and mystical methods.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The sum of these
super photons, when

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:84%
produced in
significant quantities,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.590 align:middle line:84%
essentially constitutes
the light body,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
because they form like a cloud
of light around the person.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> A question that
naturally emerges is,

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:84%
why would you want to attain
the light body to begin with?

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
It's an arduous path that
requires 100% dedication,

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and most people, likely,
won't be able to attain it.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
The reason why you
want to attain it

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:84%
is not just to
fast track yourself

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
through the Tibetan Bardo,
or the afterlife realm,

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:84%
or the halls of Amenti in
the Egyptian tradition,

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
or purgatory in the
Christian tradition.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.290 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's a path towards
greater love and compassion.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:84%
You ultimately learn about
the spiritual functioning

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:84%
of the physiological
flesh and blood body.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:84%
You begin to apprehend
and understand and live

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.800 align:middle line:84%
from the point of understanding
of your connection and oneness

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.610 align:middle line:84%
with all that is, and
the recognition that love

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:84%
must be in every thought,
every action that we take.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>> When we talk about
the human light body,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:84%
we have to take into
consideration that,

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:84%
that light body is occurring
within a greater context.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not a standalone body.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a greater
field of energy.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:84%
Physicists, today,
in the lecture halls

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.290 align:middle line:90%
will talk about this field.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And what they will say is,
there's a field out there that

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.990 align:middle line:84%
connects all things, and
their hands are motioning away

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.090 align:middle line:90%
from their bodies.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.510 align:middle line:10%
What they're missing is that,
yes, the field is out there.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Field is in here.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
The light body is not
separate from the field.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:90%
We are the field.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:84%
We are disturbances in an
otherwise homogeneous field

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:90%
of energy and information.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So in this way, the
awakening of the light body

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.380 align:middle line:84%
goes far beyond simply
a spiritual practice.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
It is an opportunity to embrace
the fullness of our humanness

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
and to bring our
humanness to bear

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:84%
upon our everyday lives
in ways that we're only

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.360 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing about the light
body initiatory path is that it

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:84%
takes immense dedication,
almost superhuman dedication,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
ultimately aimed at the
understanding that it's going

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
to cost you everything, that
your entire earthly existence

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:84%
can be a part of your
consciousness that can then be

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:90%
teleported to another location.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:90%
You can take that with you.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
But everything else that we know
of Earth life will stay behind.

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is something
that some people, perhaps,

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
are not willing to take
that dramatic of a step.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But today, we are recognizing
that this is a reality.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It is more than a possibility.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It's something that, according
to the Dalai Lama, all of us

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:84%
are charged with
learning how to do.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama would also
state that you have likely

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:84%
spent many, many, many lifetimes
studying this and working

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.780 align:middle line:84%
towards attaining
it, and that you

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.470 align:middle line:90%
can attain it in one lifetime.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> These practices of attaining
the light body are a process--

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.890 align:middle line:90%
it's a build up process.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I in our world
today, a lot of people

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:84%
want the fast
route, the shortcut.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And while there may
be a fast route,

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:84%
there's not really a shortcut,
but there are accelerated ways

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.720 align:middle line:90%
of accomplishing this.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think many of the
ancient mystery school

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and initiatory paths give
you those accelerated ways

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.410 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish this.

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is why those mystery
schools have been preserved.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:90%
That's why they're there.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:84%
They're there to guide us
through the process of awakening

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.910 align:middle line:90%
and attainment.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, the path of
following the rainbow light body

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and the light body tradition
aligns me with the cosmos.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the recognition.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:47.670 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something that one
figure in a particular tradition

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:84%
has attained, be it Osiris
or Padmasambhava or Christ.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:84%
It's something that all of us
have the potential to attain.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:01.060 align:middle line:84%
We're all essentially
star walkers in disguise.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And by following the
light body practices,

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.750 align:middle line:84%
we're going to link our
consciousness with other star

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:09.940 align:middle line:84%
walkers from other
regions of space time.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so
tremendously exciting.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to have--

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to learn how
to do this all by myself.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:19.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not incumbent upon
me to figure it out.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:90%
It's long been figured out.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.630 align:middle line:84%
All I have to do
is get on the path.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey,
welcome to the universe

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.720 align:middle line:84%
is the message from
the light body.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> We have to cultivate this.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.630 align:middle line:90%
It is a practice.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that we can just

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:39.480 align:middle line:84%
shortcut by trying to have
something outside of us

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:90%
do it to us.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:84%
We have to cultivate
it within us.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:90%
The key is you, right?

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.480 align:middle line:84%
This power, this potential,
is inside of you.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not outside of you.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to master it,
if you want to attain it,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.320 align:middle line:84%
it has to start
from inside of you.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.610 align:middle line:90%
You are the key.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:01.280 align:middle line:90%
You are the divine potential.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:90%
