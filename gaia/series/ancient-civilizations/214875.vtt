00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Egypt-- along the western
bank of the mighty Nile River,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:84%
a sprawling pyramid field
dots the sacred sand.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Throughout history, this
region has been known

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:90%
as the Memphite Necropolis.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Named after the ancient
capital of Egypt, Memphis,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
this necropolis, which
translates from ancient Greek

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:84%
as cemetery or city
of the dead, is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
home to the most sophisticated
and highly debated

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
ancient civilizations
known to man.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:84%
The grandiosity, power, and
purpose of these pyramids

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.910 align:middle line:84%
have baffled all who
have studied them.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But the mainstream
argument for pyramids

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.560 align:middle line:84%
as being strictly burial
tombs is sharply challenged.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:84%
What other evidence
does this sacred sand

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
conceal that could alter the
mainstream timeline for the rise

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:90%
of human civilizations?

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.980 align:middle line:10%
>> The area that is called the
pyramid fields is a mysterious

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:10%
area that stretches
all the way from Giza,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:10%
just outside of Cairo, all
the way down to Dahshur.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
This entire area
has pyramids that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:84%
remain in different
states of preservation.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, when you look at
them, look like a mound of earth

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:84%
because they are
so deteriorated.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And some of them, such
as the ones on Giza,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:84%
are very clearly
beautiful pyramids.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:10%
>> There are a number of
different pyramid fields

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:10%
You have Giza, then a
series of other ones,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:10%
including Abusir, Saqqara,
and ending with Dahshur.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask yourself, why
are they all on the West Bank?

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Why are they not
on the East Bank?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is because the
ancient Egyptians believed

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that the west was the direction
of the dead and the afterlife,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and the east was the direction,
because of the rising

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:90%
sun, of life and rebirth.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And this whole dualism of
the west representing death,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:84%
the east representing life, was
an integral part of everything

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:90%
the ancient Egyptians did.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And Memphis was one of the
major capital cities of ancient

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:10%
Egypt.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's this huge network
in Memphis of the necropolis,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, these tunnels
and crypts and this,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, very complex
structure of building for both,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I would say, for
rites of initiation,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.730 align:middle line:84%
immersion into the
underworld, as well as

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:84%
for the burial of the dead,
where the kings and the pharaohs

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.350 align:middle line:84%
started to erect their tombs,
their temples, their pyramids.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's quite the network of
underworld initiation and burial

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:84%
that is associated with
the Memphis Necropolis.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Roughly eight kilometers or
five miles northwest of the Giza

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Plateau sits an anomalous
archaeological site named Abu

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Rawash.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.670 align:middle line:10%
This lesser known
location, often referred to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:10%
as being the home to the
pharaoh Djedefre's lost pyramid,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:10%
contains the remains
of two pyramid bases

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.600 align:middle line:10%
and looks down on
the Giza Plateau

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:10%
from roughly 300 feet
higher above sea level.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.440 align:middle line:10%
The ancient history
of Abu Rawash

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:10%
appears to be very turbulent
and contains many more questions

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:10%
than answers.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Everybody is aware of Giza.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:10%
This is where you
have the three Great

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:10%
Pyramids there of
Khufu, his son, Khafre,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:10%
and his son, Menkaure.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:10%
There's a whole
family group here.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But there is a missing
link with all of this,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:90%
and that is Abu Rawash.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:10%
And when you get there,
you climb a hill,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.240 align:middle line:10%
and all you see in
front of you to start

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:10%
with is a massive debris field.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:10%
It's like some kind of cataclysm
has struck this pyramid

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:10%
and virtually destroyed it
almost down to the ground.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And you walk amongst
these huge blocks of stone

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.760 align:middle line:90%
weighing tons apiece.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, in
the center of it,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:84%
there's this massive pit
with this causeway going down

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:90%
into it, which is gigantic.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And you look around, and
you wonder what the hell

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:90%
has gone on here in the past.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who was Djedefre?

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Why did he build here, and
why was his pyramid destroyed?

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Here is a guy, Djedefre,
who's the second son of King

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.610 align:middle line:10%
Khufu, who allegedly
built the Great Pyramid.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.760 align:middle line:10%
His older brother
dies, and now Djedefre

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.960 align:middle line:10%
has an opportunity to leave
a monument for eternity.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.750 align:middle line:84%
He would look out at what we
think of as the Giza Plateau

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:84%
today and see one pyramid,
that belonging to his father.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And you would think
he would want to build

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
right next to his father.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
He'd want to be close
to him for eternity,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:90%
but he doesn't do that.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:90%
He goes five miles northwest.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.640 align:middle line:90%
He goes to a high ground.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.750 align:middle line:84%
He stands on this high ground,
what is today called Abu Rawash,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and he looks north
into the delta.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
You can see all the way
to the Mediterranean.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:84%
He looks across the Nile
River, and he sees Heliopolis,

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:90%
the city of the sun.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm going to be
the first pharaoh that's

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
going to take the name,
Son of Ra, Son of the Sun.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
build my pyramid here.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's called
Djedefre's Starry Sky.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's a magnificent building,
according to descriptions.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
It's made of granite,
but it's got a skin on it

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
that's made of an alloy of
gold, silver, and copper that

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:90%
shimmered in the sun.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It had to have just been
absolutely magnificent.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
But what's fascinating
about his story

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
is that he completely abandons
the magnificence of what we see

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:90%
today in the Pyramid of Khufu.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
When he builds his pyramid,
he doesn't build the chambers

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
on the inside, like
his father did.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:90%
He builds them underground.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't build his
pyramid from scratch.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
He builds it on top
of a pile of rubble.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And as time will
tell, his pyramid

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
disintegrates, either
of its own volition

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
or it's destroyed, possibly
by some external force

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
or simply by people coming
and harvesting its stones

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:90%
to build other complexes.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're left with the
mystery in these questions of,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.580 align:middle line:84%
why didn't he build
on the Giza Plateau,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:90%
like his younger brother did?

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Why did he go off to
this mysterious place?

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
What was it that
prompted him to go there?

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the unusual features
of Abu Rawash is the fact that

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
when you go to the site
itself, it's rarely visited.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:10%
It's a private
access kind of job.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:10%
You can't just turn up there.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:10%
It looks like the stones are
scattered around the whole area.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
This is one thing that
a lot of people notice.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:90%
There's granite everywhere.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:90%
There's chunks of limestone.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is beautifully
polished and curved in places.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And it does look like there's
some kind of cataclysm

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.970 align:middle line:90%
has hit the site.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.970 align:middle line:84%
We see similar things, though,
on the Giza Plateau as well.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So people are
suggesting that there's

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
some kind of technology there
that may have went wrong

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and actually caused this
kind of destruction.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most mysterious
sites that we're finding is Abu

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Rawash, and it is a site that
we don't know a lot about

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:84%
because the truth is, we
don't know who built it.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
We don't know when
it was damaged

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
and when it was destroyed.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:84%
What makes it so unique is
that it is a pyramid that's

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:90%
open to the sky.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.180 align:middle line:10%
What was perhaps
even more interesting

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:10%
is not far from this pyramid
is a mysterious staircase.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:84%
You can only see this staircase
when you're on top of it

00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:84%
because it is carved into
the flat limestone plateau,

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and looking across, you would
never see this staircase.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It begins at ground level,
and it goes gradually,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
about a 45-degree
angle down 100 feet.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And today, it now
goes into the water

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
because when the high
dam was built in Egypt,

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
it backed up the Nile
and the groundwater.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
The groundwater has
risen and has actually

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:84%
flooded many of the
temples throughout Egypt.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what
does this staircase lead to?

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Who would go through
the trouble to build

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful
staircase that appears

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to go nowhere, or at least
into the water, at this time?

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a staircase built into
a complex that's 22 miles long,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:90%
over 4,000 square acres.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And this staircase--
the speculation

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:84%
is that it is an opening,
it is an entrance that

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:84%
goes into the tunnels,
into the chambers that

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:84%
are underneath this plateau,
just as we have staircases

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and tunnels that go underneath
Giza, ground-penetrating radar

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:90%
showing that very clearly.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what
we're going to find?

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I think the pyramid
and the staircase

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
together are probably
working to tell us

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:84%
a story, if we can look at
this as a connected system

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:84%
rather than as isolated
events in our ancient past.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:34.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Abu Rawash is weird, and I'll
say that because we know so far

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:10%
that the Nile, being what it
is, a mirror of the Milky Way--

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:10%
and several of the
pyramids are actually

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.275 align:middle line:10%
mirror images of specific stars
and constellations on the Nile.

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have
the Giza pyramids,

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
which at this specific
moment in time,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
according to Bauval and Gilbert,
mirror the constellation

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.085 align:middle line:84%
of Orion, 10,400
BC on the equinox.

00:10:54.085 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're standing there
at that particular moment,

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and you look over this way,
and you look at the night sky,

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that Sirius is
also sitting right next to it,

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and it falls right over Iwnw,
or Heliopolis, as it's called

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:90%
today, which is the Academy.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You go over this
way, and you start

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:84%
going down to the Red
Pyramid and the Bent Pyramid.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And they basically are mirror
images of the Hyades cluster

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:90%
in Taurus.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
further south,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:84%
you end up where
the Pleiades are.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So that leaves us
with Abu Rawash.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't seem
to match anything.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:90%
So now we have a conundrum.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:84%
If all the pyramids
were laid out

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
according to a mirror of
map of the sky at the time,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.948 align:middle line:90%
what is Abu Rawash doing there?

00:11:33.948 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Have we forgotten
something is there,

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.210 align:middle line:84%
another element in the sky
that we are familiar with?

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>> As the debate around the
date of construction of this

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
mysterious site continues, the
evidence that this site was

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:84%
connected to the Memphite
Necropolis is mounting.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
But the question remains,
was this potential pyramid

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.710 align:middle line:90%
destroyed or dismantled?

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's go with
the first argument.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids were
built in one go,

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.360 align:middle line:84%
so it was part of
a unified plan.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:10%
So that means that
Abu Rawash also

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:10%
would have had to
have been built,

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:08.335 align:middle line:10%
and it has since been destroyed.

00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:10%
And we know that it's true.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's option one.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a pyramid, and then it's
been systematically taken down

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.400 align:middle line:90%
to build the towns around it.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.177 align:middle line:84%
The second option, which I tend
to go with a little bit more,

00:12:20.177 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
it's to do with the fact that
the pyramids weren't built

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
in their entirety early on, that
there was a blueprint laid down,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and Abu Rawash was
part of that blueprint.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was stopped
for some reason.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:10%
We just don't know
why because there

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:10%
is a comparative one
at Zawyet El-Aryan,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle line:10%
which is just
probably about also

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:10%
eight miles further south of
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these two
pyramids, which are non-pyramids

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:90%
or they're destroyed pyramids.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.490 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at the
way that Abu Rawash was

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:10%
built with a huge
sort of slope down

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:10%
into the middle of the bedrock
at a certain level of degree,

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:10%
about 26 degrees, I believe,
fashions out into a T shape,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:10%
it's exactly what we
see at Zawyet El-Aryan.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:10%
And we know that that
also was interrupted

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.960 align:middle line:10%
by some enormous event because
when the sand was dug out

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:10%
of the pit, we found
all the stones that

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:10%
were ready to be built
around that hole, which

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:10%
were deliberately shaped as
part of the interior passages.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:10%
The stones have been
dumped into the actual hole

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:10%
as though they were put
there by this enormous force,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.150 align:middle line:10%
like a wall of water, which
absolutely fits in the idea

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.340 align:middle line:10%
that all the pyramids were
built at the same moment

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:10%
around the time of the flood.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So I very much ascribe
to that particular theory

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that Abu Rawash was
part of that plan.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:90%
It was a real pyramid.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The problems with
Abu Rawash is, one,

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
that we have this amazing
technology that's going

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:90%
into Khufu's pyramid.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:10%
Admittedly, it was probably
not built by Khufu.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:10%
It had been built
at an earlier time,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:10%
and Khufu simply tried to do
some sort of restoration on it,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:10%
and, therefore, his
name is attached to it.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.560 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that his
successor couldn't even

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
complete the pyramid
that he tried to build

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the technology
was lost somewhere.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Indications are it
was either taken apart

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.600 align:middle line:90%
or it was blown apart.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:10%
So that means Djedefre, whose
name literally means "the power

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:10%
of the djed," which represented
the spinal column of Osiris,

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.200 align:middle line:10%
he probably did not
build this pyramid.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
It was part of the
bigger network that

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:90%
was being built in antiquity.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
If anything, he
tried to restore it

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:90%
and wasn't able to restore it.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>> As the relics from this perch
above Giza continue to puzzle

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.370 align:middle line:84%
alternative researchers, a
clue, left to us from an Italian

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:84%
cartographer, may spark a new
debate on an unsolved ancient

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:90%
legend.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:10%
>> I was in Florence and had the
opportunity to visit the Galileo

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:10%
Museum.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:10%
It's an amazing place.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.600 align:middle line:10%
And one of the artifacts
that was in there that caught

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:10%
my attention was a map
titled The Fra Mauro Map,

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:10%
by a cartographer
from the 15th century.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:84%
He was Italian,
and he'd actually

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
taken the painstaking
effort to draw out

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
every aspect of the known
world at that time, since 1457.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:10%
One of the first places I went
to as I looked at this map

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:10%
is I looked straight for Egypt.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:10%
So I looked for the
Nile River, but I was

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:10%
unable to find the Nile River.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It was under a different name,
listed as a river named Gihon.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I immediately thought, why would
he have named the river Gihon?

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Gihon is a reference to
the Bible in Genesis.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:84%
The place where the four rivers
meet is the Garden of Eden,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and the four rivers are supposed
to be the Tigris, Euphrates,

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the Gihon River, and
the Pishon River.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Why was the Gihon listed
as the Nile River?

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:84%
I also noticed that the Giza
Plateau had five pyramids on it,

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:90%
not three.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:84%
This and many other questions
led me to investigate this,

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and what I found
has the potential

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:84%
to dramatically shift
how we perceive and see

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.490 align:middle line:84%
all the sites of Egypt versus
the Mesopotamian sites.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:10%
And, in particular, it pointed
directly to the word, Babylonia,

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:10%
which I'd recognized
because Babylon

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:10%
is the old name for Cairo.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, today it's even marked
by the Fortress of Babylon,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:51.900 align:middle line:84%
which is not far to
the northwest of Giza.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:84%
As I look more deeply into
this subject of Babylonia,

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that eight kilometers
northwest of the Giza Plateau

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is a very enigmatic place
that sits immediately

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:84%
to the west of what we
would consider old Babylon.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:10%
This is another
pyramid complex that

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:10%
has two pyramids that have been
partially destroyed, flattened,

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:10%
as it were.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:10%
They sit high atop a
plateau, both pyramids being

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:10%
made of the very expensive
and difficult to quarry rose

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:10%
granite that comes
all the way from Aswan

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:10%
a full 800 kilometers away.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of
effort to undertake.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:84%
As we look around the
Abu Rawash plateau today,

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:84%
we'll find the strewn
blocks, literally hundreds

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.910 align:middle line:84%
of meters, many of them 10 to
15 or even 20 tons in weight,

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:84%
that have been tossed hundreds
of meters from the center point

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:90%
to where those blocks sit today.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:55.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a really enigmatic place
that requires a lot more study.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And given its reference directly
across along the Gihon River

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
matching with Babylon,
I couldn't help

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
but ask myself the
question, might there

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.070 align:middle line:84%
be more to this story
yet to be unfolded?

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:15.710 align:middle line:84%
The Djedefre satellite pyramid
would have stood at 103.7ft

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:20.150 align:middle line:84%
high, but because it sits 300
feet higher in elevation than

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:84%
the Giza Plateau and because
of its very steep architecture,

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.620 align:middle line:84%
it would have appeared to
tower over the Giza Plateau.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is 481
feet, but the Djed Pyramid

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that is immediately behind
the Djedefre satellite

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
would have stood
about 600 feet high

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
when compared with the same
elevation with the Giza Plateau.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:84%
This would have,
by far, looked as

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
though it would have
been the tallest

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:90%
building in all of the land.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It could have seen, very likely,
for many, many tens of miles

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
in distance from both
the Giza Plateau,

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:90%
as well as from Abu Rawash.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.940 align:middle line:10%
What did these
pyramids represent?

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:10%
And their construction--
why was it made out

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:10%
of the most expensive
rose quartz granite

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:10%
that is only found in the
sarcophagus in the King's

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:10%
Chamber?

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Because of its expense.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Both of these pyramids
had casing stones that

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:90%
were entirely rose granite.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:10%
Crystalline pyramids-- both of
these pyramids somehow exploded.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:84%
How did those blocks
get so far away,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:90%
weighing 10, 20, even 30 tons?

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
We only have more
and more questions

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
related to what the exact
purpose was of this plateau

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:90%
high upon this hilltop.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
What was the meaning
of these pyramids,

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and why do we have
no reference to them

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.560 align:middle line:90%
throughout any of our history?

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, this Abu Rawash pyramid,
because it has an 86.4-foot base

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.990 align:middle line:10%
width, means that its height
would have been 103.7 feet high,

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:10%
and then a 60-degree
pyramid, slope angle,

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:10%
immediately adjacent
to it, to the diagonal.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:10%
And what you find there is that
that pyramid with a 60-degree

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:10%
angle would have stood
approximately 300 feet high from

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.230 align:middle line:10%
the plateau with the plateau
being 300 feet higher than

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:10%
the Giza Plateau, referencing
a pyramid that would have been

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.790 align:middle line:10%
approximately 600 feet high
with a super steep slope angle.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It would have definitely
left an imposing feeling

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
on anybody looking at it
from the Giza Plateau.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the
reference is something

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.390 align:middle line:90%
that's closer to heaven.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:10%
The base of the Djedefre
satellite pyramid,

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:10%
86-feet-point-four,
So 86.4 feet,

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:10%
which references 86,400
seconds in one day.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Is this telling us something
about the relationship

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.290 align:middle line:90%
of the arc of time?

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
As I started to look at this
and imagine standing on the Giza

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Plateau, if I looked up to look
at these foreboding structures,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
crystalline pyramids
high upon this hilltop,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
far off in the distance
having a pink granite hue,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I started to ask, might
there be any reference

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:90%
historically to these pyramids?

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And I could only
find one location.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
These extraordinarily
tall structures

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
might be a direct reference to
the story of the Tower of Babel.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:10%
I also noted that the
relationship to Babylon,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:10%
as well as the
relationship, as mentioned

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:10%
in the Bible in the Genesis
account in chapter 10,

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:10%
where we noticed that this
structure of the Tower of Babel

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.080 align:middle line:10%
was supposed to have been built
next to the Gihon River, which

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:10%
also is where Babylon
would have been found,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:10%
or Babylonia, as we find
on the Fra Mauro Map.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't help but ask
myself the question, given

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:10%
the age and the large
block construction,

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:10%
might this location
of Abu Rawash actually

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:10%
have been the place where
Nimrod, the son of Kush,

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:10%
would have built
these two pyramid

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:10%
structures to represent
the Tower of Babel,

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:10%
an ascent back into heaven?

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.100 align:middle line:84%
As we dive more deeply into the
biblical account in Genesis,

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
chapter 10, we see that
Nimrod, the builder

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of the Tower of Babel, which
is where the languages were

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
supposedly confounded, was the
son of a very famous person

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:42.590 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Kush, who was the
grandson of Noah, Noah of Noah's

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Ark.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Nimrod was known as
the Great Hunter.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Notice also the reference to
the Great Hunter of Orion.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Nimrod, being the
son of Kush, would

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.950 align:middle line:84%
have come from where
the Kushite people came.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible, it
actually references as well

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
that the River Gihon goes into
and flows into the place of Kush

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.360 align:middle line:84%
because Gihon actually
means gushing water.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The word "gush" or "kush"
is from this derivative.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:10%
So, therefore, as we look at
the place where this river came

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:24.560 align:middle line:10%
from in Southern Egypt, we then
must ask ourselves the question,

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:10%
is it more likely that
the Kushite people that

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.800 align:middle line:10%
are referenced in the Bible were
in the ancient land of Kemet?

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.610 align:middle line:10%
And, in fact, I could find
no reference in contrast

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:10%
to the people of Kush ever
having visited Mesopotamia.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So if we take the biblical
account at face value,

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and also that Josephus
and the Nile River

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
was known anciently
as the Gihon River,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:84%
we must consider Abu Rawash
as a potential location

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:90%
for the ancient Tower of Babel.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The story of the Tower of
Babel is very interesting,

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:10%
especially concerning the
origin of human languages.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:10.270 align:middle line:84%
But let's explore this notion
that the Babylon we know of

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:84%
is a replica city
of something that

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:17.520 align:middle line:84%
existed far earlier, a city
that we now know as Cairo.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And what if the Tower of Babel
was there, and it was destroyed?

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
How would that affect our
understanding of human history?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.520 align:middle line:84%
The ramifications of changing
the original location

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:84%
of the city of Babylon
are incomprehensible.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It would rewrite history books.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:40.090 align:middle line:84%
It would change mainstream
understanding of human history,

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and it would change what we
know about human language.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:49.150 align:middle line:10%
Prior to the Younger
Dryas incident,

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:10%
there seems to be the
suggestion that there

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.940 align:middle line:10%
was a worldwide network
going on and that there

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:10%
were certain areas, particularly
like this area in Egypt,

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:10%
but also at Teotihuacan
in Mexico and Xi'an

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:10%
in China, where
they were building

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:10%
these pyramids for a
very specific purpose.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:10%
And we know they're all
related by the measurements

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:10%
of their bases
and their heights.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's very
clear they were all

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:10%
based on the megalithic yard.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.340 align:middle line:10%
And so there was a
connection between them all.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:10%
So ultimately, that whole
region where these pyramids

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.190 align:middle line:10%
were being built, these
pyramids were literally

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.650 align:middle line:10%
meant to be towers
to reach the heavens.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:10%
Even if we look at them as
stargates, that's really

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:10%
what a stargate is, right?

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.930 align:middle line:84%
You're creating a tower
to reach the heavens.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were all working
with each other, which

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
means they all had enough
of a similar language

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do this.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And then after the cataclysm,
everyone got separated.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:10%
Languages started to
develop separately.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is very much in line
with that Tower of Babel story.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.720 align:middle line:84%
It's quite possible that
this region of Egypt

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:84%
was the main source
of this story

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and that later researchers
began to realize that

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and pointed to this
being the true Babylon.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look
across the plains,

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.430 align:middle line:84%
we see above the ground is
only a fraction of the secrets

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:90%
and the mystery under our feet.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.790 align:middle line:84%
What the science
is telling us today

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:84%
is that when we
look at Abu Rawash,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries that we
know exist will only

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:84%
continue to unfold in
future generations.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Abu Rawash tells us that
something happened in this place

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago,
something important,

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and it was worth the time
and the energy of the people

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:84%
at that time to
build the pyramid,

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:90%
to build that staircase.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:10%
The fact that so little
is understood in this area

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:10%
tells us that what
is under our feet

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:02.100 align:middle line:10%
is probably
undisturbed, pristine,

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:05.270 align:middle line:10%
and may open the door to
even deeper understandings

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:10%
of our relationship
to the cosmos

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:12.010 align:middle line:10%
