00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
>> 200 miles South
of Lima, Peru,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
lies an expanse of desolate
land known as the Nazca Valley.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
This sprawling swath
of flat, dry earth

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
is home to some of Earth's most
enigmatic and ancient geometric

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:90%
forms known as the Nazca Lines.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Historians, anthropologists, and
archaeologists alike have been

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
attempting to understand
the purpose of these immense

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
formations since 1553 when
mention of the Nazca Lines was

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
first published in the writings
of Pedro Cieza de LeÃ³n,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
who initially mistook
them for trail markers.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
The ancient imagery carved
into the desert surface of Peru

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.390 align:middle line:84%
can only be viewed in their
entirety from high above.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
For whom were the
Nazca Lines intended?

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:84%
The mystery continues
to intrigue researchers

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.755 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The desert in that part of
Peru is covered with pebbles

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:90%
that have oxidized-- iron oxide.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a darker material.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:10%
And to create the
lines themselves

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:10%
and the images and
the geometric figures,

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:10%
all that had to be done
was to go 12 to 15 inches,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.990 align:middle line:10%
remove 12 to 15 inches
of the oxidized pebbles,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:10%
and you reveal the lighter,
tan-colored sand beneath.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So the construction is
not so much of a mystery.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:90%
The mystery is the proportions.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:84%
How did the people
on the ground know

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.200 align:middle line:84%
where to direct
that construction

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to reflect the accuracy
of the massive figures

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
that we now see only from above?

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I was so many times in Nazca.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I made myself over
5,000 pictures of Nazca.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
I show you here now
pictures of Nazca which

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:90%
were never shown on television.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And you really are shocked
when you see these designs

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.520 align:middle line:90%
and look at them carefully.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:10%
Until today, the
scientific community

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:10%
has come up with the
following information.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:10%
All these designs on the ground
is an astronomical calendar.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And they say it was a
code for the water gods.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Another scientist
suggested, no, it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:84%
was a code for
the mountain gods.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
I read always in
scientific magazines,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
now it is a code
for agriculture.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:90%
My god, this is ridiculous.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:90%
There was never agriculture.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:90%
It's too hot for it.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
If ever a time something
was growing there green,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
then you would not see
the designs anymore.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
We have had, in the
scientific community,

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.600 align:middle line:90%
so many explanations.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And every scientist
think this is plausible.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
That's the next
natural explanation.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:90%
It's all nonsense.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Just look at these
gigantic lines.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:90%
This is eye openers.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> As remarkable as the ancient
Nazca Lines and the theories

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
surrounding them are, scientists
are continuing to discover

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
ancient geoglyphs in
the area still today.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:10%
In November of 2019,
143 new geoglyphs

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:10%
were unearthed in the
Nazca Pampa region

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.670 align:middle line:10%
with the help of Yamagata
University in Japan and IBM.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
A special artificial
intelligence technology

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.540 align:middle line:84%
was used to assist in the
discovery of these new glyphs.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:10%
The new geoglyphs ranged
from simple geometric shapes

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:10%
and plants to zoomorphic
designs of animals,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:10%
some several hundreds
of meters in length

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:10%
etched into the terrain.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The Nazca Lines are
still being revealed.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:10%
Only recently
Japanese scientists

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:10%
discovered another 70
images in the Nazca desert

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.120 align:middle line:10%
that had not
previously been known

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.330 align:middle line:10%
by using drone
technology, now, to help

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:10%
reveal where these sites are.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So the Nazca Lines, some of
them are geometric patterns.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of the 70 are of
animals and plants.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
simply linear lines

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:90%
that extend for 70 to 80 miles.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the mysteries
is, how could these

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
have been drawn
proportionally from the ground

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
when the only time that
the proportions can be seen

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:90%
is from an aerial view?

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is we don't
know the answer to that.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So when we look
at Nazca and what

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:24.760 align:middle line:84%
is now believed to be the
earthly reflection at the Nazca

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
site of the cosmos,
it is very possible

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:84%
that the knowledge of our
relationship to the stars

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
existed much earlier
and was transmitted

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:90%
to the people of Nazca.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> What might these
massive formations carved

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:84%
into the Peruvian landscape
signify for their ancient

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:90%
creators?

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the Nazca
geoglyphs represent a code

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:90%
meant for off-world visitors?

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:10%
>> The geoglyphs themselves
would seem to reflect

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.560 align:middle line:10%
the influence of the stars.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:84%
They would seem to be in
the shape of constellations

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and different asterisms
that are made out

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:90%
of the stars in the sky.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Because Nazca is in
the southern hemisphere,

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.730 align:middle line:84%
not all the stars were projected
in the codes that are carved

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.140 align:middle line:90%
in the desert.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:10%
Mostly, they are from the
south, from the perspective

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:10%
of the south and
the equator ones.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:10%
The equator ones were
the most important

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.310 align:middle line:10%
because they showed us
the moments of the year.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So most of the main
systems of stars

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that were used by many of
the cultures around the world

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
usually are those that,
for some periods of time,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.740 align:middle line:84%
disappear and then appear
again in the horizon.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:10%
So this is why Pleiades, Orion,
Canes, and other systems that

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.860 align:middle line:10%
appears in the horizon
are the main ones that you

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:10%
can find in those carvings.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, why was
this important to these people?

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.990 align:middle line:84%
What specifics can we connect
from the constellations

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
in the sky to the images below?

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The spider is very much
connected to Orion, apparently.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you actually track parts
of the body of the spider,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize
that they seem

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.000 align:middle line:84%
to track the actual projection
of the belt stars of Orion

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's a natural
marker on the ground.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:10%
And the fact that the
most ancient countries

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:10%
of all around the Earth also
are associated with the belt

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:10%
stars of Orion--

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:10%
and this is where you were in
South America, Central America,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:10%
China, Japan, the Pacific
Islands, and even Europe.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:84%
It's always an association
with the belt stars of Orion.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Some of the birds--
the hummingbird

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and other exotic creatures
that are found in Nazca--

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
also appear to be symbolic
of certain constellations

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:84%
as they would have
been seen and projected

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.188 align:middle line:84%
on the ground at
that particular time.

00:08:05.188 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I find
interesting about these birds

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.740 align:middle line:90%
is that they're not local.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.630 align:middle line:84%
They're not the local
species of birds.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
They're exotic species which
are found in the Amazon,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.880 align:middle line:90%
so quite a way away from Nazca.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's a reason why they
brought these birds all the way

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
from a place where they
don't exist to this location

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
in order to make them the
projection of something

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that you see up in the sky
and bring that projection

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:90%
onto the ground.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Again, you have to understand
that they are there

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:84%
for their eyes,
not for our eyes.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:90%
But what were they looking at?

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back into their
shoes and their mythology

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
in order to understand why they
use certain shapes to bring

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:44.370 align:middle line:84%
down onto the ground the
projection of the sky.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> But why did the ancient
people of this South American

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:84%
region find these specific
stars so important?

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:84%
The link between these
remarkable ancient engravings

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and stellar constellations
in the night sky

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
has been well documented
by numerous researchers

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.900 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
The idea first gained
prominence in 1941

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:84%
when American professor
Paul Kosok teamed up

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.520 align:middle line:84%
with German-born Peruvian
archaeologist Maria Reiche

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:84%
to prove their
hypothesis that the Nazca

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Lines were the largest
astronomy book in the world.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>> She and other academics that
have looked at these geoglyphs

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.160 align:middle line:84%
have concluded that they were
definitely aligned towards

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
the horizon, towards
celestial objects--

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
the rising of the
sun, for instance,

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the solstices,
the rising and the setting

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
of specific stars, stars
that related to the shape

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.640 align:middle line:90%
and design of the geoglyphs.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:10%
I mean, for instance, one
of the constellations that

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:10%
would seem to have come up
in a number of the theories

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:10%
is that of Orion.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:10%
Another is the constellation
of Cygnus, the celestial bird,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:10%
which has been connected
with more than one

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:10%
of the designs of birds that
are actually on the landscape.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And the importance about those
two particular constellations

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.080 align:middle line:84%
is that they are linked
by the Milky Way.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:10%
They are each at opposite
ends of the Milky Way.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:10%
Why is this significant?

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.580 align:middle line:10%
Because one of
the other theories

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.430 align:middle line:10%
is that the geoglyphs
represent what

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:32.680 align:middle line:10%
are known as dark star
constellations or dark cloud

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:10%
constellations.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And what these are
is the dark shapes

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:84%
that are formed by
the Milky Way as it's

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:90%
perceived in the night sky.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that would seem

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to have been particularly
important to the peoples

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:84%
of South America and,
indeed, the peoples

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:90%
of the southern hemisphere.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
In the northern hemisphere,
this doesn't become so important

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
because the Milky Way
looks completely different.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.050 align:middle line:90%
And it has its own traditions.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:84%
But in the southern
hemisphere, in South America,

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:84%
in places like Peru, these
dark cloud constellations

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:90%
were very important, indeed.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The Great Rift, a series
of dark areas within the Milky

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Way, appear more visible and
prominent in the southern

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:90%
hemisphere than in the northern.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
These dark areas had
a great importance

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient people native
to places such as Australia

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and South America.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
But what was it about
these areas of darkness

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:90%
that drew in such reverence?

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Maria Reiche's theories
on the Nazca Lines

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:84%
extended to suggest
that the valley itself

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:84%
was intended to act as
a kind of observatory

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to point to the places
on the distant horizon

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.370 align:middle line:84%
where the sun and other
celestial bodies rose

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:90%
or set in the solstices.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that these
lines not only connected

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:84%
to celestial bodies
but connected

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:90%
to something even bigger?

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of them would seem
to be focused upon the rising

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:84%
or the setting of
celestial objects--

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the sun
or different stars.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
answer is that we

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:84%
are dealing with some kind
of ritualistic process

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that is not only about the
survival of the Nazca people,

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:84%
who would seem to have been the
manufacturers of the geoglyphs,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
but their relationship
to the cosmos as a whole.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:39.370 align:middle line:10%
In other words,
they saw that there

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:10%
was an absolute relationship
between what is above

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.888 align:middle line:10%
and what is below.

00:12:45.888 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
reasons why there are so

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
many different geoglyphs
with different designs,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
because they had to try
everything, quite literally.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
They had to connect
with every star

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, every constellation,
every different point

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon, and everything
that is beneath the Earth--

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
the fault lines, the
aquifers, and the soil itself

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
with this complete symbiotic
relationship between humanity

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and the cosmos--

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.825 align:middle line:84%
and that if they got this
right, they would survive.

00:13:19.825 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The area of geoglyphs
itself is a perfect position.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.010 align:middle line:84%
You have a perfect
horizon in which

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:84%
to look at ascending
and descending objects.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And you also have a
crescent of mountains

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:84%
with which to use as an
intercardinal horizon.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:10%
And the same thing
exists in Cusco,

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:10%
not too far away from there.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.880 align:middle line:10%
They used the mountains
and the hollows

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:10%
in the mountains
in which to project

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:10%
the risings of certain
objects, which is very

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.723 align:middle line:10%
important to ancient people.

00:13:47.723 --> 00:13:49.140 align:middle line:10%
And when you
actually look at many

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.332 align:middle line:10%
of the lines and the alignments
and the shapes of Nazca,

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:10%
they seem to be
pretty much aligned

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:10%
to specific features
on the horizon.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was no secret
that ancient cultures

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.690 align:middle line:90%
were obsessed with the sky.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
It was all to do with
the acknowledgment

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that everything that was
in the sky was perfect,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and you wanted to draw that
perfection onto the ground,

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
onto the Earth so you could lead
a much more purposeful life,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:84%
so that your gears are in sync
with the rest of the universe

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
because nothing was separate
in the old traditions.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
So geoglyphs became
the sort of place

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:84%
where a good astronomer was
able to look at the sky and mark

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:90%
things with absolute precision.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at Nazca
not as a location by itself

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
but you see it as
a bigger picture

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
of the culture of
the Andes, which

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
talks about an antediluvian
civilization that survived

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:84%
a global catastrophe,
and then the survivors

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.540 align:middle line:84%
arrived in the
Andes and they began

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
to establish hot spots of
information-- academies,

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.408 align:middle line:90%
for lack of a better word.

00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:50.700 align:middle line:84%
When you start looking at
the places which the gods are

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
associated, you begin
to realize that Nazca

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work by itself.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
It is part of a much,
much bigger picture.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the sprawling
plains of the Nazca Valley

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient artwork carved
into them truly be intended

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.240 align:middle line:84%
for a visiting alien
race of beings?

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.440 align:middle line:84%
If this is so, is it possible
that the first Nazca Lines were

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:84%
actually created by
otherworldly beings

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and then the natives
created additions to them?

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:10%
>> The Nazca plains
are, of course,

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:10%
incredible Earth formations.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:10%
And clearly they were
made for aeronauts,

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:10%
for people from the sky who were
able to see them from above.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And since we know that most
primitive people did not really

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
have this technology,
this, of course,

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
immediately begins to
make us ask questions

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:90%
like, who built them?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Who created them?

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And who was up there in
airplanes or dirigibles

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.780 align:middle line:84%
or spaceships or UROs to the
able to actually witness them?

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So they were made as, I
think, codes or keys, messages

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:90%
to humankind.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could there
be messages not only on this

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Earth but also off planet?

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the
Nazca Lines here on Earth,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
we can see similar kinds
of formations on Mars.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
things that's so amazing.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.930 align:middle line:84%
As we've had the Mars Rover
and the other satellite

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:84%
imagery that has
come from Mars, we've

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
seen not only what looks like
the ruins of civilizations

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:84%
with carvings and
mountains, but also we've

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
seen these aerial
formations that

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
look very much like the
same kind of figures

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have found
in the Nazca plains,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.930 align:middle line:84%
telling us that perhaps the
same groups were actually

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:84%
stationed on Mars at one time
before it became uninhabitable.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> If these lines can be found
not only on Earth but also off

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Earth, is it possible they
are markings for a powerful

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.620 align:middle line:90%
location or portal?

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Some researchers into ley
lines, like Maria Wheatley,

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:84%
believe this Nazca region
to be a convergence

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.630 align:middle line:90%
of several sources of energies.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:10%
>> Ley lines create unique
portals all over the world

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:10%
because there's more than
just the ley involved.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:10%
So if we think of a ley line
is coursing through with energy

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:10%
and it's above very deep water,
such as a very deep aquifer,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:10%
that's what creates a major
portal, a combination of Earth

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.830 align:middle line:10%
energy's underground
water and ley lines.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
There is one totally unique
ley system associated to Nazca.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
In the world, there are
very rare ley systems,

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and they're called
triangular ley systems.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, Nazca has a white
triangular system

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:84%
that links it to
Stonehenge, and it links it

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
to the Badlands Guardian,
which is a geological wonder

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.610 align:middle line:90%
in Alberta, Canada.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's got Stonehenge
energy flowing through it.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:90%
It goes through to Canada.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:10%
But the magical thing
about the Nazca Lines

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.600 align:middle line:10%
is it links to the long
lost continent of Atlantis,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:10%
which appears in the
triangular ley system.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:10%
When you have a
triangular ley system,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:10%
it's constantly
flowing with energy.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:10%
It's repetitive,
and it's powerful.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:10%
And I think what really
anchored that magical system was

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis, because if
we imagined Atlantis

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:10%
had numerous leys
coursing through it,

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:10%
it'd be like the
spoke of a wheel

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:10%
within that triangular system.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:84%
That would have been
an all-powerful place.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Nazca Lines be
connected to Atlantis or other

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:42.820 align:middle line:84%
regions, making this a powerful
portal for visitors from

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.930 align:middle line:90%
another world?

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:84%
If so, is it possible there
was a certain message embedded

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:90%
in the symbolism?

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The portal of Nazca is not
precisely in Nazca itself.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.410 align:middle line:84%
The main portal is the Lake
Titicaca and the islands

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:90%
that are within the lake.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But the region of
Nazca is, like,

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
kind of a map where
you can understand

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:84%
where to find all
the other portals

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and because, also,
this is connected

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
by the whole equator that
connects the whole planet

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:90%
from Egypt to French Polynesia.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So this place, one of the
main purposes that it had

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:84%
was to guide people in
different dimensions

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to connect with every
part of the world.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
So for all the people
of South America,

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that region would
be the place where

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:84%
you could walk with the
divine, where you could

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:90%
walk through the information.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:48.945 align:middle line:84%
So by sitting there, by
walking through the lines,

00:19:48.945 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:84%
you could be connected
with information

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:84%
of every one of the lines around
the planet, the ley lines where

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:90%
the information was flowing.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And surrounding it, we
have the constellations,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
mostly the south constellations
that were the ones guiding

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:90%
the people of the South.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So there are two different
types of information

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:84%
there, the constellations
that shaped

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:84%
the idea of who we are and
the constellations from where

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:84%
the people from the
stars came to this world

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
to teach about their
knowledge and also the lines

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:90%
that connect the whole grid.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's the area
where you should

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.060 align:middle line:84%
head to when you want
to see beyond, when

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:90%
you want to see the future.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> If these maps connected us
to the stars and the whole grid,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:90%
who might have created them?

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
the ancient vision,

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.190 align:middle line:84%
the Nazca Lines has
two different meanings.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
The first one
connects all the lines

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.490 align:middle line:84%
in between the portions of the
Earth, all the ley lines that

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.770 align:middle line:90%
connects all the information--

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
where to move through, how
to download the information,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
how to recognize all the
geometry of the world.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only
a map for humans

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and not even for spaceships
that come from the skies,

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:84%
but they are maps for
interdimensional beings

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.750 align:middle line:84%
that there can see
all the directions,

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.360 align:middle line:84%
the precise directions
towards the whole planet

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
so they can reach every sacred
point in every direction.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the Nazca
Lines were created by the same

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional beings that
created other great creations,

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:90%
such as the pyramids.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
These beings know how to
channel energy into the planets

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that they work on, and
this isn't the first planet

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:90%
that they've done this to.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:10%
There are various planets,
including Mars, Jupiter, Venus.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:10%
And they have
these specific sort

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.710 align:middle line:10%
of what I call
magic sigils or you

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.910 align:middle line:10%
might say certain formations,
even similar to crop circles.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is to
channel the energy in.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Where the Nazca
Lines were created

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot of ley lines
that join right under there.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.640 align:middle line:84%
These specific ley lines
are connected directly

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:90%
to the Nazca Lines.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And what that does
is it intensifies

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:84%
1,000 times more the energy
of that specific area.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Where there is a lot of
energy that is magnified,

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
you can then use that
to create a portal

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and access other dimensions
because you need energy

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:90%
to access other dimensions.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So they were
channeling this energy

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:84%
to create this
portal so that they

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:90%
could access other dimensions.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could
Nazca be some kind of airport?

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible that
the lines themselves leave

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:90%
behind another hidden code?

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Some believe that the
Atlantean civilization

00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:02.820 align:middle line:84%
had many spaceports and that
Nazca was one of the main ones.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
The animals depicted by
the geoglyphs aligned

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.010 align:middle line:84%
to certain
constellations and are

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
there to guide the spaceships
entering the planet.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.630 align:middle line:10%
The actual lines have a
mathematical relationship

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.170 align:middle line:10%
to the Nazca geoglyphs that
is based on the base 12

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:10%
mathematical system.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
These lines were
made by tractor beams

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:29.310 align:middle line:84%
of spaceships, the same
technology used for the crop

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.020 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The long lines that
cross between the figures

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.480 align:middle line:84%
are interlaced
with certain angles

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
and denote certain information
for ships landing on the Nazca

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Lines.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.650 align:middle line:84%
These lines indicate
where vehicles

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
should land based on their label
as either private or military

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:90%
ships.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:84%
The details where
each ship should park

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:84%
were dictated by a computer
system in an underground base

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:90%
below the Nazca plateau.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:84%
It is said that these computers
were placed in semicircles

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:90%
around a large hologram.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
This hologram communicates
with the ship with letters

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.740 align:middle line:84%
or symbols and directs
the ships where and how

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.320 align:middle line:90%
to land on the plateau.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Some experts even say it
is still under Earth today.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Could this be one of
the main spaceports

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:84%
of not only the Atlanteans
but other races as well?

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible there are many
places throughout the world

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.850 align:middle line:84%
where interdimensional
beings could connect

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:90%
to the Earth's energy grid?

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
But why specifically
the Nazca area?

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
What was so special
about this region

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.740 align:middle line:84%
that certain knowledge was
embedded into its surface?

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Following the ideas of the
beings that were coming from

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.290 align:middle line:84%
the heavens, the region was
very in touch with the Sirius

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones guiding
the project of the Americas

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:90%
as once they did in Africa.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So the Sirius
people, they started

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:84%
to shape the idea of Africa
and the Far East in Asia.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And when that region
stopped to have the flow,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:84%
they knew that the next step
would be South America because

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
of an alignment that these
three continents has in relation

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:90%
with the portal of Orion.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is why they choose
this region to settle

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:84%
the guide for humans
and other beings

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.440 align:middle line:84%
to understand where we are
heading to, where we are going

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:90%
to as Earth, as a planet.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So they started to
go to South America

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to settle this idea of
the New World coming.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:84%
This is why the Sirius
people used that region

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to calibrate the
perception of the world.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:10%
This is why they
lived there and we

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.660 align:middle line:10%
can find the skulls
of the Sirius people

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:10%
there, because they lived there.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:84%
They used this portal to connect
humanity with the future,

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:84%
to connect themselves with
the purpose of the world.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So the whole region,
not only Nazca--

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Nazca is just a map
of the whole region.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
All the civilizations that
went through that area,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
even before the Quechua and
Aymara people lived there,

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:38.790 align:middle line:84%
they were there to bring a
new concept, a new idea of how

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:90%
to connect to the world.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Were the Nazca Lines
created by otherworldly beings

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years in the past
as a map or a guide to Earth?

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, did these
interdimensional beings

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:84%
use this information to create
a new connection in the world?

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Could their legacy
and ancient knowledge

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.170 align:middle line:90%
be here, etched in the desert?

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.210 align:middle line:84%
