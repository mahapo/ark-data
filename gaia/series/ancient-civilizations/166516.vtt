00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2013, a female
relative of Albert Perry,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:10%
an African-American man
from South Carolina,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.980 align:middle line:10%
submitted a sample of his DNA
to a company called Family Tree

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:10%
to trace family roots.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
During the routine DNA
analysis, technicians

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:84%
at the genetic testing
company made an extremely rare

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%
discovery.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:10%
Albert Perry contained
a Y chromosome

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:10%
with a genetic
signature like no other.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:10%
Y chromosomes are
the hereditary factor

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:10%
determining the male sex.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:10%
Albert Perry revealed that the
most recent, common ancestor

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:10%
for his lineage was roaming the
Earth about 338,000 years ago.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:10%
Geneticists have
been able to prove

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:10%
that all men tested thus far
in these commercial databases

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:10%
can trace their Y chromosome to
a common male ancestor labeled

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:10%
Adam that lived between
60,000 and 140,000 years ago.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle line:84%
This made his DNA over twice
as old as any fossil on record

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.290 align:middle line:90%
for Homo sapiens.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, scientists are
questioning everything

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:10%
that is known about
the time and location

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:10%
of the first people on Earth.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:10%
Is this finally the proof
pre-Adamite theorists

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:10%
have been looking
for, that there really

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:10%
were human civilizations
before the age of Adam and Eve?

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what other
doors can Perry's DNA open?

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at these
pre-Adamite records of what

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.980 align:middle line:84%
these ancient texts
are telling us,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:84%
it maps together very nicely
with the actual archaeological

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:84%
ruins that we find
around the world.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
What gets even more interesting
is when we get into the idea

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
in that post-Atlantean
catastrophe world,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:84%
meaning post-12,500 years ago,
two pre-Adamite groups survived

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
with fast and
limited resources--

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
one group in Europe
and one in Asia,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
which becomes the Egyptians'
pharaonic line and the other

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
group in Mesoamerica, which
becomes the Mesoamerican

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.560 align:middle line:90%
priesthood.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If Albert Perry's Y
chromosome pre-dates this

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:84%
by hundreds of
thousands of years,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:90%
what are the implications?

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible there was an
earlier human population that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.800 align:middle line:90%
became extinct?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
An incredible
artifact that has been

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
a topic of great controversy
among historians and scholars

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
trying to get to the
bottom of this mystery

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:84%
is a king's list found in
the Sumerian cuneiforms.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The king lists go
back 266,000 years.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's interesting.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Because modern
scientists believe

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
that the first humans like
us came into existence

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:90%
less than 200,000 years ago.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that the
first civilizations where

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:84%
you would have kings,
and urban areas,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
and social organization--
they believe that all started

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.570 align:middle line:90%
6,000 or 7,000 years ago.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So to have these Sumerian King
Lists going back 266,000 years

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:90%
is really amazing.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The actual artifact itself
is engraved in cuneiform text.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And during that
time and era, people

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:84%
didn't just carve
these types of things

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:90%
into stone just for a hobby.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
It's real information, real
data, and real history.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, the actual
artifact itself is

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
located in Ashmolean
Museum in Oxford, England.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
What's so incredible about
it is that the king's list

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.450 align:middle line:84%
gives the reign of
the kings and shars.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.025 align:middle line:10%
Well, what is a shar?

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerians state that this
shar is about 3,600 years.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And for example, King Alulim
actually ruled for 10 shars.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So in human years, that
would be 36,000 years.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> 36,000 years?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Could it really be
true that humans

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
were on Earth so long
ago and not just humans,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
but advanced civilizations
with hierarchies and kings?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not just the
Sumerian Kings Lists.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It's also the Egyptian
kings list of--

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Manetho writes about the
dynasties going back.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:10%
Maybe not as long, but
at least 30,000 BC--

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:10%
gods like Thoth
and others, deities

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:10%
that were called the nine
particular reigning deities

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:10%
of the Egyptian world.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So if these deities
have, again, lifetimes--

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
lifespans of thousands of years,
then, of course, to a human,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:84%
it's going to seem as
though they are gods.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:10%
>> But if humans had been around
for close to 300,000 years,

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:10%
according to Albert
Perry's DNA test,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:10%
why do all these creation
stories come from a much later

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:10%
time?

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And even more odd,
why do we hold on

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to the truths that were
given to us by these gods?

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Researcher and
historian Anton Parks

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
has a disturbing
theory about this.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to know that when
the gods arrived on Earth,

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
according to what
the tablets state,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
they reigned over the Earth
for thousands of years.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Elements of the story are in
the Zohar, the Nag Hammadi text

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
as well, which basically
tell the same story

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.275 align:middle line:84%
and the same version
as the Sumerian one

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:90%
to enslave mankind.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Human beings must behave,
not think too much, and most

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.140 align:middle line:84%
of all, not see that there
is another reality to what

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:90%
is said.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.780 align:middle line:84%
In the texts of Eden,
there is a curious scene.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
It describes humans, especially
created to work in the garden.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, in order
to enforce their laws,

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
the gods place the
humans in front of them.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:10%
Behind the gods is
their shiny chariot.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.230 align:middle line:90%
That is how it is written.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And they make them
pledge allegiance.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It is fascinating.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
They impose their
views upon mankind.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:90%
They want to scare them.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, through this oath
to which humanity commits,

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:84%
humans forbid themselves
to ever be free.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I personally think
that to this day,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:84%
we are still under the
influence of this oath.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It is crucial to understand
that in concrete terms,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:90%
we are still slaves.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I think that the gods
knew what an oath implied.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:90%
A vow is something tangible.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Something actually happens.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this can
be passed from one life

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:10%
>> As a species that was
created by DNA manipulation,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:10%
we've never been free from
the manipulation of beings

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:10%
on the outside, and that the
sad irony and history is that

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:10%
humans have gotten down on
their knees to things standing

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:10%
in front of them that
had the name god.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:10%
And they were never gods.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:10%
>> If they weren't gods, is it
possible that these beings were

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:10%
able to manipulate human DNA to
such a point that the original

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.770 align:middle line:10%
free roaming human species
became part of a worker class

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.698 align:middle line:10%
with shorter lives
and of less power?

00:07:50.698 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the
Sumerian Kings List,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
we see that the more recent
part of this list actually

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
corresponds very nicely
with historical records.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.760 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when you look at the
kings list in its entirety,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:84%
you go all the way back to the
alleged origin of the Anunnaki

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, tinkering
with our DNA,

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
starting about
250,000 years ago.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, when you get
into the Sumerian doctrine,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that
they were genetically

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
modifying a slave race
of people on this Earth

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.150 align:middle line:90%
approximately 250,000 years ago.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.992 align:middle line:84%
And it was Enki,
supposedly the good guy

00:08:22.992 --> 00:08:24.450 align:middle line:84%
in the battle of
the two brothers--

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Enki and Enlil who
created us this way.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And we were manufactured by Enki
to become able to reproduce,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:84%
whereas prior to that point,
we were bred to be sterile,

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.057 align:middle line:84%
so they could make a certain
number of these clones.

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
They could then send
them out there to work.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:90%
They would die.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And there would be no threat of
them becoming their own race.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:10%
>> If the lifespan of our
early kings was 36,000 years,

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:10%
it appears something in our
evolution changed 12,500 years

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.560 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:10%
In the book of
Genesis, God said,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:10%
my spirit shall not
strive with man forever,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:10%
because he also is flesh.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:10%
Nevertheless, his days
shall be 120 years.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:10%
Did human lives get
shortened at some point?

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Is this proof that there
was a genetic manipulation?

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And if so, why?

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:10%
The longest known human
lifespan that modern scientists

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.290 align:middle line:10%
have on record, a woman who
died in the French countryside

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:10%
in 1997, was 122.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:10%
Since then there has
been significant debate

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:10%
about whether modern man
has reached the upper limits

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:10%
of our longevity.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Methuselah in the
scriptures lived a long time.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:90%
We have these stories.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Did God intervene
and change our DNA?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.880 align:middle line:10%
So now, we only get 125
years, or 150 years,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:10%
or some shorter period?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:10%
If so, why?

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:10%
Would there be any way to
find this, to get this back?

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Or is it working on
some other level?

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Do we have longer
or shorter lives

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:84%
in a spiritual sense, in
a psychological sense,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:90%
in an emotional sense?

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Has the rush of modern life
shortened our lived experience

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and there is some way to gain
the enormity, the expanse

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:90%
of time that we once knew?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>> In my research, I use the
term devolution or devolved.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And for me, that means
a couple of things.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.890 align:middle line:10%
One thing it means is
that as conscious beings,

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:10%
we originally exist on some
higher level of reality

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:10%
that I call the level
of pure consciousness.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And the ruling principle of
that level of pure consciousness

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:84%
is harmonious,
loving cooperation

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
among all conscious
beings and the source

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.560 align:middle line:90%
of all conscious beings.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Some conscious selves
become egotistical.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
They develop a desire to
control, dominate, and exploit

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And they can no longer
exist on that higher

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:90%
level of pure consciousness.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:84%
There has to be some
other reality for them

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:84%
to act out their selfish
desires to dominate, control,

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:90%
and exploit others.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
That is the material
level of reality.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:10%
So that process by which
a conscious self descends

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:10%
from that higher
level of reality

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:10%
into the world of matter
is what I call devolution.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:10%
So the conscious selves on this
level of reality are devolved.

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:10%
And that means they don't
evolve up from matter.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
They devolve or come down from
this higher level of reality.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Did we as humans,
at one point,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
exist in a higher reality
and then at one point devolve

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:90%
into a lower level?

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:90%
If so, what could be the reason?

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Anton Parks suggests that
there is information that

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.290 align:middle line:90%
points to certain bloodlines.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:23.247 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.247 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> When you start looking
at these subjects,

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.440 align:middle line:84%
whether it is on the web or in
some books that people qualify

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
as possibly conspiracy books,
it is often spoken of a genetic

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:90%
lineage--

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:90%
reptilian and of royal blood.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I do think that some royal
bloodlines still exist nowadays

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that come from the
Anunas, specifically

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:84%
the lineage of Enlil,
Ninurta, and An.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these descendants of
royal bloodlines be able to see

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:84%
beyond the current reality
in order to control it?

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Could this be more evidence
of a tampering with our DNA?

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:10%
Reporter Linda Howe has
an interesting theory

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:10%
on the origins of
the term blue blood.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:10%
>> One friend and colleague
of mine was Laurence Gardner.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:10%
He was tracking the
whole significance

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.620 align:middle line:10%
of certain bloodlines going
back into Mesopotamia.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:10%
I was encountering exactly
the same information

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:10%
coming in to my investigations
of an alien presence

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:10%
on this planet and
throughout the solar system.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
We found that we
met at a same point.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was that
in Mesopotamia,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:84%
that all of the Anunnaki were
supposed to be reptilian,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and that the
reptilian biology had

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
blood that was
dominated by copper

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and that they literally
had blue-colored blood.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We have red, because we
have an iron dominant blood.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:10%
So our discussion
from his history

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:10%
and my trying to get into
it through aliens that

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:10%
have been dominating
the Earth was

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:10%
that the blue blood reptilians
of Mesopotamia led to a group

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:10%
called the Merovingians.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Merovingians tie
later in the timeline directly

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to France, Germany, and
that area of Europe.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Because for some reason, that
bloodline, the blue bloods,

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:90%
went to Europe.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Laurence Gardiner
and other people's

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
work coming through
royalty blue blood

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:39.090 align:middle line:84%
tie this connection between
the reptilians, Merovingians,

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:90%
and Mesopotamia.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were literally a
reptilian blue blood line.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:10%
>> If this is more
evidence of a manipulation,

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.150 align:middle line:10%
how does our DNA and an oath
hold weight in our current

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:10%
reality?

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Anton Parks explains how his
studies of several ancient text

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:84%
reveal similar stories
about humankind surrendering

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:84%
their will to Sumerian
gods, but that in the end,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:90%
we choose to kneel.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that we are still
under the influence of the oath

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:84%
sworn by humanity in front of
the gods and their chariot.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:84%
At this particular
point, humanity

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
forbade itself from
ever knowing freedom

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.120 align:middle line:90%
and from thinking freely.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They more or less
enslaved themselves.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:90%
We can see that in general.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are
quite submissive.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
When certain laws
pass nowadays, instead

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.970 align:middle line:84%
of saying that we don't
agree, we first say yes.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And if we find a couple of brave
men who are ready to protest,

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:84%
in that case things
can get moving.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:84%
But it can take decades
or hundreds of years

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:90%
before anything happens.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Slavery is a good example.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I think we
are still under the oath

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that the human race swore
to the Sumerian gods

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:90%
in front of their spaceship.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I think that there
are several ways

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
of breaking this type
of oath, first of all

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
by acknowledging it,
by allowing oneself

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.780 align:middle line:90%
and by saying it out loud.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not anymore under the oath
that was sworn to the Anunas.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.105 align:middle line:90%
And this works for any oath.

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:84%
From the moment
when you know you

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:84%
have sworn an oath in this
life or in a previous one,

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.890 align:middle line:84%
you can actually liberate
yourself quite simply.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be possible
to liberate ourselves from

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
our restricted
boundaries here on Earth?

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Could we evolve back
into our original state?

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:49.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Originally, we all exist as
beings of pure consciousness

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:10%
on a higher level of reality.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.040 align:middle line:10%
The reason we're here
is somehow or other,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:10%
we've made decisions that
disqualify us from existing

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:10%
on that higher plane.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So the main purpose
of human life,

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
according to many ancient
wisdom traditions,

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is to restore consciousness
to its original, pure state.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.609 align:middle line:84%
And there are higher
beings in this universe who

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:90%
are trying to help us do that.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
ways that they help

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
us do that is by providing
places on Earth where it

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:40.100 align:middle line:84%
becomes easier to engage in
the processes of meditation,

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and yoga, and
contemplation that help

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:84%
restore consciousness
to its original state

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:90%
where it's easier to do that.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:84%
You could call them embassies
from the spiritual world.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The movement of ancient
knowledge is really hardwired

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:84%
into the understanding
of perfection,

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:90%
harmony in these places.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:10%
The idea was to bring
into physical focus

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.200 align:middle line:10%
that which is
absolutely perfect.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:10%
The idea was to build in
the center of these cities

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:10%
a temple of humanity
where everything that is

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:10%
perfect in terms of
measure, geometry, energy.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:10%
Everything that is
invisible is manifested

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:10%
in formal space that
allows an entire society

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.330 align:middle line:10%
to vibrate to that
perfection and become perfect

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:10%
within itself.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So depending on who's got
control of this, it works,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.245 align:middle line:90%
and then it doesn't.

00:18:38.245 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
If you go to
central Paris, there

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.745 align:middle line:84%
is a sense that there's
something perfect about it.

00:18:41.745 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:90%
This is why we're drawn to it.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:10%
Luxor in Egypt, which
itself is also a mirror

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:10%
image of places in Sumeria.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And they are mirror
images of temples which

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:90%
are no longer above the ground.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:90%
They're now under water.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was always the
same-- to establish perfection

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.990 align:middle line:84%
on Earth so that humans
can realize their greatest

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just about
working with energy.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.443 align:middle line:90%
Energy doesn't know what it is.

00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Energy is just energy.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not right or wrong.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
If you add intent to it,
it defines the direction,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.540 align:middle line:90%
where the energy goes.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:10%
And that was the idea behind
all the ancient cultures,

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:10%
to create these ancient
ideas, put your correct intent

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.150 align:middle line:10%
into it, and create
greatness or not.

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these ancient places
hold the keys to evolving past

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:90%
the current system?

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
If so, how old might
the current system be?

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at our modern
civilization and we think that

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
we've evolved so much, let's not
forget that Sumer is the cradle

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.970 align:middle line:84%
of civilization and that so much
of what started there is still

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:90%
in place in our modern world.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
This includes the entire
system of how we measure time--

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
60 seconds in a minute,
60 minutes in an hour,

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:84%
24 hours in a day, and
the way in which we

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:90%
structure our cities--

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
the idea of plumbing,
the idea of city planning

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:90%
with streets and buildings.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:84%
All of that stuff comes directly
from the Sumerian civilization,

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
which seems to, in
conventional historical view,

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
pop up almost out of
nowhere from what had been,

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:84%
up until then, a
hunter-gatherer type of culture.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
We also see the whole basis
of the Code of Hammurabi

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and written codified laws,
which actually started again

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.250 align:middle line:90%
in Sumer.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We see the development of
a money system in Sumer.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:84%
We see roles of men and women,
this patriarchal society

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:90%
appearing in Sumer.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, so much of what
we have in our modern world

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.932 align:middle line:84%
hasn't changed since
the time of Sumer.

00:20:30.932 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:10%
And if we expand our
consciousness a little bit

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:10%
and consider that the written
history of Sumer is not what we

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:10%
hear about in our textbooks,
that it actually is

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:10%
a 250,000-year old civilization,
it would appear that the gods

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.798 align:middle line:10%
built that civilization or what
some have called the Archons

00:20:45.798 --> 00:20:48.340 align:middle line:10%
and that they, in fact, built
the solar system on the purpose

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:10%
to withstand the test of time
and to create a form of silent

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:10%
tyranny.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:10%
With the money system
comes the ability

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:10%
of small groups of people
to determine who lives

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.503 align:middle line:10%
and who dies, who
eats and who starves,

00:20:58.503 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:10%
and to become
incredibly powerful.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.378 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
no common sharing

00:21:01.378 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:90%
of the wealth of the planet.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be
acceptable to the people.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
It seems that there
is a fair system.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's very easily controlled
by the elite power structure

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and allows them to effectively
imprison an entire planet.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And it allows them to wield
an unnaturally high degree

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.170 align:middle line:90%
of control.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.810 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we, in the end, just
acting out an embedded loop

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:84%
that runs like a play, where
all that we know is based

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
on Sumerian rule
by imposing gods?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, are we able and
willing to break it and evolve?

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> By setting up situations
that are very challenging where

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
there's war, there's
death, there's suffering,

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
we're all presented
with choices again,

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.900 align:middle line:90%
again in our life and we choose.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.570 align:middle line:84%
If you choose the
negative, it just

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.778 align:middle line:90%
means you chose the negative.

00:21:50.778 --> 00:21:52.487 align:middle line:10%
And when you die, you
look back and like,

00:21:52.487 --> 00:21:53.680 align:middle line:10%
oh, I chose the negative.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:10%
And next time, you'll
try to program yourself

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.060 align:middle line:10%
so that hopefully, you'll
become more and more positive.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the clues and
symbols depicted in ancient

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:84%
civilizations help us
change the current game?

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:84%
Could we evolve from
our current state

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and possibly live longer like
the gods of ancient times?

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:84%
For example, if the system
that we reside in now

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:84%
is created to run on
duality consciousness,

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
that would be the choice between
the positive and the negative.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:84%
Then could we break it with
a unity consciousness, which

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:84%
is the understanding that one
spirit moves through everything

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:90%
and there is no separation?

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:10%
>> In the ancient mythology,
there was a strong tendency

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:10%
to tell stories of the
battle of good and evil.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.310 align:middle line:10%
And certain gods would
represent the forces of evil

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:10%
and want control.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:90%
And they would be arrogant.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And the good god
would finally prevail.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And you would have certain areas
where these battles took place.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
We can see immediately that this
is a philosophical construct

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.253 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, there
are temptations.

00:22:56.253 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:84%
There is certainly
the possibility

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:90%
of corruption in human affairs.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:10%
And this would get involved
in the theology of the time.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And we would hope that
the good would win out.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Was this the point
of knowledge given to us

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:10%
in the proverbial garden?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Could the point of
characters labeled as good

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and evil in the ancient text be
the continued story of duality

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:90%
that we live in today?

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And do we have all
the information

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to understand where we
are and how to break free

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.340 align:middle line:90%
from our current system?

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:84%
For if this is a
forced reality upon us,

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.790 align:middle line:84%
can we break it by understanding
that we have the choice

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:90%
to be slaves or to be free?

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Jack Cary explains
a possible link

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:84%
between agricultural
and human development

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
that literally
popped up overnight.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> At first, there was nothing.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden, we have
civilization after civilization

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:90%
at mathematics, culture.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.270 align:middle line:90%
They're building monuments.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
They're performing
agricultural feats.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe that all of
these-- that all of that

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
can be equated to the
introduction of these cereal

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:90%
grains into our DNA.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:84%
Because she was actually
affecting human DNA

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
at that time through a number
of different experiments.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next on "Ancient
Civilizations--"

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.750 align:middle line:84%
could the agricultural
revolution have changed the DNA

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:23.890 align:middle line:90%
of humanity?

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:90%
And if so, how was it created?
