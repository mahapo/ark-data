00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.260 align:middle line:84%
However, what he actually
uncovered instead

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.420 align:middle line:84%
was the exact location of the
ancient Sumerian city of Ur.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Was he getting close?

>> The early archaeologists
were trying to prove the Bible

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:10%
and they were funded
by biblical societies.

And that's, you
know, in other words,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
they had to come
up with the proof.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And it ignored a lot of
legends and traditions

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%

Sumerian and Akkadian.

And amongst all the tablets
discovered, about a dozen

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.106 align:middle line:84%
of them or about
the Garden of Eden.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:84%

of the Garden of Eden?

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Or was this just another
clue leading researchers

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.075 align:middle line:90%
to another location?

whether the Assyrians,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.050 align:middle line:10%
whether the Babylonians, who
rose to prominence in that

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:10%
area, who were not Sumerians,
nevertheless venerated

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:10%
and highly valued everything
that the Sumerians did.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we can
read the Sumerian language

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:84%
because those
later cultures made

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:84%
a project of taking
Sumerian texts

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.480 align:middle line:84%
and translating them
into their language.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And those are languages
that the scholars could

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
read because they were
Semitic languages,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
they belong to a
language family where

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:90%
the code could be cracked.

done by later cultures who

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%

and collaborated with NASA,
he was very interested

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.240 align:middle line:10%
in the Sumerian translations

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:10%
with these 10 tablets found
at Sippar to check symbols one

complete opposite.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
The true translations
did not comply.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:10%
I persistently did
research on Hebrew

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:10%
but nothing was
coming out of it.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:10%
And then completely
by chance, I came

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.790 align:middle line:10%
across a
Sumero-Akkadian lexicon,

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:10%
and this is when I could
finally slowly start

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.960 align:middle line:10%
to translate the tablets.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What Anton Parks began to
translate was a completely

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.380 align:middle line:84%
different version of the
Garden of Eden than we've heard

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Not only had the words
been mistranslated,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
the actual location
had been overlooked.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> In biblical texts, we
constantly read about this idea

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:90%
of heaven or paradise.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:10%
This comes from the
Greek paradeisos,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:10%
and this literally means
enclosure for wild animals.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Not paradise, a term that was
later transcribed as garden

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:90%
during the Hellenistic era.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to the original
translation in the Sumerian

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
tablets, it says, the
men who serve the gods

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
work for them in the garden
and are treated like animals.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
It is a very clear
and recurrent theme.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:84%
They are slaves who served
the divine community.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:84%
In Hebraic texts, we
understand that the humans

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
seem happy in this
so-called paradise which

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, more like
a concentration camp,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.200 align:middle line:90%
according to Sumerian texts.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:10%
In my translations, we also
discovered the word kharsag,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:10%
which translated to
city of the gods.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that all
the highest points in Turkey

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.145 align:middle line:84%
are named Karadag, which
strangely resembles Kharsag.

00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Karadag translates
to black mountain,

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and also refers to the
highest mountains in Turkey.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:84%
The only summit with
the name Karadag

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
that is close to the
Mesopotamian plain

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and tributary of the Tigris
and only a few kilometers

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:84%
from the Euphrates,
stands 29 kilometers south

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.650 align:middle line:84%
of the City Sirte
and 19 kilometers

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.960 align:middle line:90%
southwest of the city of Ur.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Is this the paradise described
in the Sumerian text?

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Gerry sent me images of
this site from Google Earth.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:10%

the mountainside,

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:10%
there is a little plain.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:10%
This is where I think the
Garden of Eden of the gods

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.812 align:middle line:10%
was located based on my
translation of the text.

00:08:31.812 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The Garden of Eden was where
the four rivers emerged from,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:84%
two of which are easily
identified as the Euphrates

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:49.140 align:middle line:84%
and the Tigris, which do Indeed
obviously flow through modern

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Iraq and empty out
into the Arabian Sea,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
but they rise in
Southeast Turkey.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And the other two
rivers can be identified

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:84%
as rivers that also rise in
Southeast to Eastern Turkey.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
All of these rivers emerge
in the same general parts

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:84%

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:84%
could this be the actual
location for the Garden

of Eden?

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
The closest paved road
to the proposed location

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:90%
is Highway 5651.

scholars and
archaeologists consider

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
this area highly
politically unstable,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:90%
and it has remained untouched.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
All we have at the
moment is the language

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
to decode from the Sumerian
Cuneiforms, the Cuneiforms that

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
describe a different
kind of paradise.

These 10 tablets,

the Garden of Eden was created.

>> [NON-ENGLISH]

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.280 align:middle line:84%
From my translations,
I discovered

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
when the Sumerian
gods arrived on Earth,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
they settled on this mountain
in order to create a colony

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and be able to survive.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they suffered
damage and ended up

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
on this mountain because of a
war, and they found shelter.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Many experts believe that they
came from the Pleiades star

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:90%
cluster.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:10%
My opinion is that
they came from there.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.995 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the war broke
out around there.

00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:38.370 align:middle line:10%
But I really
believe that this is

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:10%
where the Annunas were created.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:10%
During this conflict,
on one side,

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.140 align:middle line:10%
you have a matriarchal
regime, and on the other side,

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:10%
a patriarchal one with
all these new gods.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
There are conflicts in
space, those new landscapes.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.167 align:middle line:10%
Like it says on the
genealogy of the land tablet,

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:10%
these gods are going
to change the way

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.273 align:middle line:10%
life gets implanted on Earth.

00:10:59.273 --> 00:11:01.440 align:middle line:84%
The gods are going to create
new conditions for life

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.655 align:middle line:84%
to bloom for their
colony to thrive.

00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:10%

hope to make Earth their home?

was actually administered

by a conference of gods or a
group of gods in an assembly.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.400 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just one god.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.680 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, they would have
like their equivalent

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:10%
of the prime minister
or the CEO who would

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.550 align:middle line:10%
be in charge of this group--

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:10%
Enlil, Enki, there were
the primary members

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:10%
of this congress there.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Enki end Enlil
in the Sumerian system are

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:10%
an interesting pair.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Enlil is this rather sort
of overarching, domineering,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.710 align:middle line:90%
angry, dangerous entity.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And he doesn't really
care about humanity.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Humanity are not very
important to him.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.050 align:middle line:10%
But then we have Enki, the
trickster and the other god

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:10%
of wisdom, actually.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And he does care
about humanity and he

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:90%
intervenes on the human level.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.500 align:middle line:10%

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:10%
The texts of Eden
that I translated

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.960 align:middle line:10%
depict clearly and
quite frequently

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.282 align:middle line:10%
the reptilian
features of the gods.

00:12:25.282 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I personally estimate
that the gods

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.010 align:middle line:84%
arrived approximately
300,000 years ago.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And this derives from the
fact that Homo sapiens

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:90%
arrived shortly after.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.177 align:middle line:10%
I say this because
throughout the texts,

00:12:36.177 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:10%
genetics and the transformation
of the human being

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.900 align:middle line:10%
are recurrent themes.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:10%
The two particles that
compose the word Eden

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:51.250 align:middle line:10%
are E, which means home, and
den or ten which is life.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:90%
But Indeed, they are not alone.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Humans are already on Earth.

of creating workers

to serve the Annunas, the main
geneticists is always Enki.

00:13:19.603 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
He works with the genome

He is usually helped
by priestesses

the Nintis, who

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.490 align:middle line:10%

He can change the
human genomes according

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:10%
to what Enlil asks
of him, which would

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:10%
be left-brained,
well-disciplined humans.

Sumerian tradition,

humankind.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:10%
So it is not a single

of intelligent,
technologically-advanced

humankind began
with the sacrifice

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:10%
of the life of an advanced
being, of a god from Sumeria

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.920 align:middle line:10%
so that that god's DNA or the
blood, as what the texts say,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:10%
could be mixed with the
elements of the Earth to create

And what makes it
such a mystery is

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:10%
that it appears to be the
result of an ancient fusion

of pre-existing
chromosomes from primates

around this issue.

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.370 align:middle line:10%
It is a Sumerian term.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:10%
I don't understand
how nobody saw it.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:10%
It is very clear.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:10%
We find it in ancient lexicons.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Enlil is often referred
to as the Great Satam,

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.200 align:middle line:90%
the master administrator.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
In the Sumerian texts,
Enlil systematically

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:84%
asked Enki to go negotiate
and talk with humans.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.450 align:middle line:84%
He is always the one
to deal with them.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, he is a humanoid
with reptilian features.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:10%
And in Sumerian tablets,
he has always or very often

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:10%
called the serpent,
just like in the Bible.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.320 align:middle line:10%
He's the only one that the
humans are going to see.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.315 align:middle line:10%
And when they see him, they
see a serpent-like humanoid.

00:19:55.315 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:10%
I reckon this is
why he is called

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:10%
the serpent in the garden.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:90%

partake from this tree.

According to Parks, the
Sumerian version of this story

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
translates Yahweh
or the biblical god

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
into the great satam, which
according to Sumerian text,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
is Enlil, and the serpent
in the garden as Enki

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%

friend of the humans.

>> [NON-ENGLISH]

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It is interesting to wonder
why the serpent in Sumerian

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:84%
text, just like in the
Bible, comes to the woman.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.758 align:middle line:90%
I think there are two reasons.

00:20:51.758 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
The first one is that
I think the woman was

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
more accessible and available
when she was in the garden.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, he was more
often around women

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:84%
who were collecting
food for the colony.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:10%
The second reason is
that I think women

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.537 align:middle line:10%
are the future of mankind.

00:21:07.537 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:10%
They raise their children,
they transmit their knowledge

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:10%
to their children.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Enki is going to tell the women
the secret of tool-making.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:10%
This is expressed as gneesh
in Sumerian, which means tree.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
This means for the
first time, mankind

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.483 align:middle line:84%
could have two
sides of the tool.

00:21:26.483 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
The side that's
fundamentally good

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.800 align:middle line:84%
so that they can take care of
themselves, and the tool that

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
is fundamentally bad which they
could use to defend themselves.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.700 align:middle line:10%
One could wonder why
Enki insist on getting

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:10%
this particular secret
through to the humans.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.114 align:middle line:10%
Well, he has the desire
to set them free.

00:21:46.114 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If indeed the knowledge that
Enki portrays to the humans is

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
a tool, is this an actual
ancient weapon that some

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:84%
believe certain organizations
are looking for?

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Or is this Enki teaching the
humans about the infinite

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
abilities they possess
through their DNA?

scene where humans take up arms

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and go up the mountain
of the gods to revolt,

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and even maybe try
to kill all the gods.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:90%
What happens is an abomination.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.430 align:middle line:84%
They put back on track
the few survivors.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, from what we can
grasp from his personality,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Enki was all about peace
and wouldn't use tools

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.920 align:middle line:84%
in order to kill,
as he was perfectly

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:90%
aware of what would happen.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So this scene of humans
rebelling against the gods is

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
quite special and it cannot be
found anywhere in the Bible.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's put this
back into context.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Replace the apes
with reptilian gods

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
exact same story.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:90%

It stayed somewhere
in our brain and this

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:84%
is why we can find similar
elements in movies.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
We can find similarities

decide was the real purpose

that those choices
were important

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and that they would define
us ultimately and set out

the route map for our
immortal destiny in a way.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
in Enki and Enlil,

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
we are looking at
the dualistic pair.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about that dualism

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.580 align:middle line:84%
is its intense focus on
the future of humanity

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and what happens to us.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:00.060 align:middle line:84%
That matters to Enki, it
doesn't matter to Enlil.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%

00:25:42.078 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:10%
but they impart this
wisdom and information

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:10%
onto the humans that
actually did the labor.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these gods have
created us in their likeness?

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Was the Garden of
Eden the beginning

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:84%
for not only the gods' reign
on Earth but also humans?

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And could the constant
search for the Garden of Eden

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:03.265 align:middle line:84%
be a programmed loop
we hope to understand?

00:26:03.265 --> 00:26:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The symbolism is very
important in our sense

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.120 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves collectively
and personally.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:90%
There is something lost.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:10%
We don't know quite what
it is, but the story

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:10%
suggests it's a lost connection
with the transcendence.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we wish we could go back,
not only to the Garden of Eden,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.700 align:middle line:84%
but in other ways go back
to some earlier time.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is more
significant in the received

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:84%
wisdom than the story
of the Garden of Eden.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Graham Hancock believes that
not all is lost when you look

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:10%
to other ancient texts
that tell a similar story.

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What's dynamite in the
Gnostic system is that

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostics believe that
we have been hoodwinked,

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.040 align:middle line:84%
that that entity that we
have been taught to call god

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.452 align:middle line:90%
and worship is no such thing.

00:26:57.452 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Up next, we unearth the Nag
Hammadi and the Gnostic version

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:03.540 align:middle line:10%
of the Garden of Eden.
