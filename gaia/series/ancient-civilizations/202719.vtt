00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Just outside the quaint
town of Puente Viesgo,

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Spain is a cave system
known as Monte Castillo.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:10%
And within this
system, a specific cave

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:10%
called El Castillo contains
some of the oldest human cave

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:10%
paintings, dating back
to 41,000 years ago.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, the focus
of paleoanthropology

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:84%
has been the
representational art

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:84%
that our ancestors
left behind in caves--

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
eye-catching drawings
of deer, horse, bison,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:90%
and human figures.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:10%
But in 2012, Genevieve
von Petzinger,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:10%
paleoanthropologist
and researcher

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:10%
for the University of
Victoria, discovered something

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.880 align:middle line:10%
overlooked by many experts.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:10%
She analyzed ancient art from
over 370 ancient caves all

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:10%
over the world and discovered
that, since antiquity, humans

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:10%
have been using the
same 32 symbols--

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:10%
geometric signs that form
some kind of alphabet.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:84%
von Petzinger suggests
that the 32 signs

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.010 align:middle line:84%
do seem to have
communicative properties.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And we can possibly trace the
origins of our first writing

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.685 align:middle line:84%
system back to these
ancient symbols.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:10%
How do the symbols
that we see today

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:10%
in our religions, our flags,
and our institutions connect us

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.940 align:middle line:10%
to an ancient past that
we have barely scratched

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:10%
the surface of understanding?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And when this is
revealed, what will

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.755 align:middle line:84%
it say about humanity
and its future?

00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.370 align:middle line:10%
>> The use of symbols to
communicate ideas goes back

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:10%
into our history, long before
language was even created.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:10%
When we talk about the
study of symbols today,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:10%
there are different
kinds of symbols

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:10%
that we've become
accustomed to, sometimes

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:10%
without even thinking about it.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
There is a form of language
that has no words and no sound.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm fascinated by
this form, because it

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
may represent one of the most
advanced and sophisticated

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%
forms of communication.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.310 align:middle line:90%
It's called an ideogram.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And an ideogram does
precisely what it suggests.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.700 align:middle line:84%
It is a symbol that
represents an entire idea

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
or an entire concept
without ever uttering

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
a word, or a phrase, or a
sound to describe that idea,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and without needing the
complex language of alphabet

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
to describe the
nuances of that idea.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> If these symbols are more
complex than our current

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:84%
written language, does the
infamous number 32 have any

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:90%
correlation to the ancient past?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:10%
>> The significance of the
number 32 in the Western occult

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.390 align:middle line:10%
tradition is highly significant.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:10%
And it has to do with the
so-called tree of life

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:10%
on the Kabbalah.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.580 align:middle line:10%
So on the tree of
life on the Kabbalah,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.720 align:middle line:10%
there are 10 what are
called sefirot, or spheres.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:10%
Each one of these
spheres is supposed

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:10%
to depict a different
aspect of being.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:84%
They also seem to
depict other dimensions.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are 22 paths that
lead from sefirot to sefirot.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, those 22 paths match the 22
trumps in the tarot deck, which

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to tell people
is extremely mysterious.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows really where
the tarot deck came from.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
It just appears, with
all of this knowledge.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, each one of the
22 trumps in the tarot

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
is equated to one of the 22
letters of the Hebrew alphabet.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And since the Hebrew
alphabet letters

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
are equated to a
numerical value,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:84%
you have a perfect system of
basically what you're seeing.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So these 22 paths,
represented by numbers,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
are the frequencies
that separate

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
these different dimensions,
one from the other.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at a map,
an ancient map left to humanity

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:90%
about that knowledge.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this ancient map of 32
correlate with the 32 ancient

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:84%
symbols used around the world
almost 40,000 years ago?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Where could this
map be leading us?

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:90%
One thing is for sure--

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.910 align:middle line:84%
that some of these
ancient symbols

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
seem to be burned
into our subconscious.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So we have to ask, how is
it possible that these symbols

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:10%
stay around for thousands
upon thousands of years?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.680 align:middle line:10%
Why does culture after
culture adopt these symbols?

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:10%
There must be an
inherent meaning.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
One explanation is the
study of phosphenes.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.988 align:middle line:84%
When NASA astronauts first
went into outer space,

00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
they would look towards
the center of the galaxy.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And cosmic rays would ping
off the retina of their eye.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And they started seeing
various symbols--

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:90%
crosses, hash marks, spirals.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And it led to NASA
having to redesign

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:84%
the astronauts'
helmet so that it

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.610 align:middle line:90%
would deflect the cosmic rays.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
This led to a theory that
perhaps some of these symbols

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:90%
are hardwired into our DNA.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Whether this be the
cross on a Christian church

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:10%
or the crescent upon an
Islamic mosque, all of them--

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.780 align:middle line:10%
all of these symbols--

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:10%
are there to instill a certain
emotional reaction, one

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:10%
that will trigger deep within
us a connection with the sacred,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:10%
with the divine, with
the otherworldly.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:10%
And these symbols have been used
for tens of thousands of years.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we still see
them as important today.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:10%
>> If we take these ancient
32 symbols and we look through

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:10%
antiquity, we can see how they
have been formed into much more

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:10%
concrete images.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But these concrete images began
to hold a certain frequency

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and meaning throughout time,
meanings we still hold today.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Experts suggest there
are seven main ones--

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:84%
the vesica piscis, the Star
of David, the ankh, the cross,

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:84%
the Chakana, the swastika,
and the crescent moon.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
If we go back into
antiquity, how

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:84%
has the meaning of
these symbols changed?

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, how
do all of these symbols

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.573 align:middle line:84%
bring us back to an ancient
civilization known as Atlantis?

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
We first start with
the star and crescent.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
It is an iconographic
symbol used

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:84%
in various historical
context, but is best

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
known today as a symbol of
the Ottoman Empire, Turkey,

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:90%
and Pakistan.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It is also often considered as
a symbol of Islam, by extension.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins and Freddy Silva
suggest this ancient symbol

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
was possibly connected
with the cycle of the moon

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:90%
and its feminine origin.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The crescent symbol is not
simply a sign of the moon.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:84%
But it is the symbol of
the cycle of life itself

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that was defined from
very earliest times

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.240 align:middle line:84%
by the periodicy of the
moon, the different phases

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.390 align:middle line:84%
that it would take,
and its effect not

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
only upon the tides and water,
but also upon the human bodily

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
cycle, particularly that
within the female cycle.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the earliest recorded
uses of the crescent symbol was

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:10%
the god of Sin Babylon and,
before that, in Sumeria.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's some
interesting overlap here,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:84%
because her original
name was Sin,

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:84%
which means that
by the time you get

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:84%
to the historical
era in Christianity

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and you have sinners, it
meant that the church-- who

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
understood these concepts, and
they wanted to take the women

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and the divine bloodline
out of the whole equation--

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:84%
they began to associate
sin with the lunar concept

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:90%
by making the number 13 unlucky.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.760 align:middle line:84%
It's elemental, because
there are 13 luminations

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:90%
in every solar year.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:10%
So 12 months of the solar year,
there are 13 lunar cycles.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:10%
So the number 13 is
synonymous with the moon.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:84%
The moon, Sin, who was the lunar
goddess or the Babylonians,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:90%
is a sinner.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> In Latin, the vesica
piscis simply means "bladder

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:90%
of the fish."

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
You can find this
symbol in paintings

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:90%
of Christ and the Buddha.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And it can also be
found in sacred geometry

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and Roman depictions.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:10%
Freddy suggests
that the symbol has

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:10%
been known through antiquity
as a symbol of all knowing

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:10%
and the creative
force behind it.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:10%
>> If you take it
at its basic level--

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:10%
the understanding
that the universe

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:10%
starts with the
creative force, which

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:10%
is symbolized by the circle.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:90%
And that circle is all knowing.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:90%
It's all representative.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything exists
in that circle.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Paradoxically, it
doesn't exist outside it.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, how does the
energy in that circle

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:90%
know what's outside it?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, it begins to separate.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And once it separates, it
goes from its divine nature

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.990 align:middle line:90%
into its divine opposites.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's a tension of
opposites that takes place,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
because both
circumferences are placed

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:90%
on the center of each circle.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.005 align:middle line:84%
>> It was made very
popular by the Greeks,

00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
and certainly made very popular
during the Christian era,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.830 align:middle line:84%
because if you take the center
of the vesica piscis with

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the two arms extended, you
create the sign of the fish,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.403 align:middle line:84%
which brings us back again to
the esoteric tradition of Jesus

00:10:59.403 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and the tradition
that he was following,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with early
Gnostic Christianity,

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
which is an offshoot of Egyptian
principles and other principles

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that came back from
the time of the gods.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The Star of David,
a hexagram shape,

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:84%
is mostly associated
with the Jewish community

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
and to the first King David.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.100 align:middle line:84%
The earliest
depictions were used

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:84%
in medieval Arabic
literature by Kabbalists

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:84%
as talismanic
protective amulets,

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
where it was known as the
Seal of Solomon among Muslims.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Sonja Grace suggests
this star goes

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
far beyond the
representation of King David,

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and it represents the idea of
freedom within the universe.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The Star of David
has much older origins,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
dating back to the beginning
of this phase of humanity

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt, 10,000 BC.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:10%
It was created in
likeness of the pyramids,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:10%
but also represents what so
much of Egyptian mythology

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.150 align:middle line:10%
talks about, which is duality.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:10.840 align:middle line:84%
The Star of David was
adapted by Moses and Abraham,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:84%
because they understood what
the pyramids were actually

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:90%
used for.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So they adapted that
symbology, because they

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:84%
were trying to flee Egypt
and not be enslaved.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.680 align:middle line:84%
In the pagan
religion, it was also

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.020 align:middle line:90%
used as a transport symbol.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.275 align:middle line:84%
It was really a symbol
to free the people.

00:12:35.275 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The swastika symbol can be
found in some Asian temples

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and in Tibet as a
symbol of prosperity.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:10%
But to most people
in the West, it

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:10%
refers to the evil connected
with the Nazi regime

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:10%
during the Second World War.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But its origin seems to
go back even further.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And its meaning represents
an ancient power that

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.250 align:middle line:90%
can manifest in its center.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:10%
>> The origin of the swastika
is dated to 12,000 years ago

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:10%
in the Ukraine.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:10%
We have found an ivory
figurine with a swastika etched

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:10%
on it that then gets transferred
into the Nordic realm that's

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:10%
used throughout ancient Europe.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And then it moves
into Asia, where

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a symbol adopted by
the Hindus and the Buddhists.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Almost everywhere
the swastika appears,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
it's a symbol of life,
of luck and prosperity.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Without the spiral,
nothing can grow.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
A plant can't grow
without the spiral motion.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Blood can't flow through
the veins of the human body

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.073 align:middle line:84%
without moving in
a spiral pattern.

00:13:42.073 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Blood doesn't move that way.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:90%
It moved that way.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So without that spiral motion,
and without those four elements

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.290 align:middle line:90%
in balance, you have nothing.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancients were very
aware of the swastika.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:10%
And to them, it represented
a portal area, a vortex, what

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:10%
they call a four-armed vortex.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And that would represent
what they would call

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:90%
a very strong energy center.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of geomancy,
it does represent

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that it would be a
vortex, the swastika.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
powerful type of vortex.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The ankh and the
cross, similarly,

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:90%
are associated with Egypt.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
The ankh is one of the
most recognizable symbols

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
from ancient Egypt,
known as the key of life,

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.380 align:middle line:90%
or the cross of life.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Its association
with the afterlife

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:84%
made it a popular, potent
symbol for the Coptic Christians

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:90%
of Egypt.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But experts suggest these
are both the representations

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:90%
of power beyond this realm.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, if you go into
deep, deep antiquity,

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:84%
you discover that the
ankh predates Egypt,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:90%
predates the land of Khem.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:90%
It's antediluvial.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:10%
So when you look
at the information

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:10%
from the ancient Sumerian
cuneiform tablets,

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:10%
then you discover that Enki and
Enlil had access to something

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:10%
called a duranki, which was
also something called a bond

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:10%
heaven-Earth, where they would
walk from Earth into their home

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:10%
planet and back again.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Only the elite of the
elite had access to this.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And in order to activate
these stargates,

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
you had to have a djed
pillar ankh in your hand.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So the ankh itself would
have this djed inside of it.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And this djed looked similar
to a Tesla coil, ironically.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you had
the ankh itself.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this ankh was technology,
along with this djed.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.065 align:middle line:90%
And it was an oscillator.

00:15:32.065 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And it would oscillate
at the frequency

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic structure
of the owner of the ankh.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.605 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't match
the right frequency,

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't walk
through the stargate.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Not far from the source
of the ankh derived another

00:15:46.465 --> 00:15:47.265 align:middle line:90%
symbol.

00:15:47.265 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> As far back as
I can work out,

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:84%
the cross really
happens in Egypt.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So the cross literally
represents the materialization

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.460 align:middle line:84%
of the invisible into
the physical plane.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:84%
This eventually gets added
to the mystery's teachings.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes part of
the initiation concept.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So going back to, as far as
I can work out, 6,000 BC,

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
they come back
risen from the dead.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, they're
applied the symbol of the man

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
or the woman who is
nailed to a wooden post,

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
or a beam, or a cross,
which means that by the time

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:28.310 align:middle line:84%
you get to the Roman era, this
is a very profound symbol.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There is one more symbol
that looks like a cross,

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:90%
but it is called the Chakana.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.310 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of the
world, mostly in South America,

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:84%
a cross made out of
cubes graces the presence

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:90%
of even the Nazca area.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But this symbol also
suggests a passage

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:90%
through to another world.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The Chakana is
the equal-armed cross

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Peruvian Andes.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Many different
cultures use this.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the center of
it, it has a hole.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
And this hole was
set by the Incas

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:84%
and various other cultures
to allow the divine influence

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:84%
to come through the
center of the cross

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.909 align:middle line:84%
into the physical world
and into human beings.

00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:19.665 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.665 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The Chakana cross is one
of the most important symbols

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:90%
to the Incas.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple, three-step
cross that actually

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:90%
encodes their view on life.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the steps represents
the stellar realm,

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
the celestial realm and
the celestial bodies.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:84%
The second step represents
Earth life and all

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:90%
that we experience on Earth.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And the third step
represents the afterlife

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:90%
and the underworld.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>> If we have reused these
images over and over again,

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:90%
what is the significance?

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Is there an even deeper meaning
to their origin than stated?

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Matias de Stefano suggests that
all these symbols were actually

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
part of an ancient technology,
ingrained in our minds,

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
left over from
the Atlantean time

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.090 align:middle line:84%
period, a machine designed
to change realities.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The main technology of
Atlantis was what we call

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
the Protiktah Protiktah was
something that was brought from

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:84%
another planet,
from another world.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:10%
But it's something
that you can really

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:10%
build here and to work
with minerals that we have

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:10%
in this world, because
the Protiktah is just

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:10%
a projection, a fractal
of the construction of all

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:10%
the realities.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> If there really was a
technology designed from

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:84%
ancient times, how then to all
these symbols that seem to be

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:84%
placed in our consciousness work
together to create this device?

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So you had to understand the
spirituality within in order

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how the
technology worked.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And this created the symbols
that made every culture

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:90%
after it to be together.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:20.600 align:middle line:84%
These 33 cubes in
many dimensions

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:84%
was the main technology
to create the free energy,

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:90%
to create new realities.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So whoever accomplished to
reach the 33 cubes, the 33

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:84%
steps of the body, of
the mind, of the soul,

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
would be enlightened,
and would be like God,

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:90%
able to create realities.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
When you get that cube and
you cut it in the middle,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:84%
you will have this
second dimension.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The second dimension
will show you

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that these 27 cubes
with these other six

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:84%
around are only four around
with the shape of a square.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.360 align:middle line:90%
This creates the Chakana.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.240 align:middle line:84%
The Chakana is the symbol
from the South American

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
cultures with the
hole within, which

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:90%
is the main core of the vacuum.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:84%
So everyone could know about
the stairs to the creation.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:90%
There is no below.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:90%
There is no east and west.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:84%
All the path is
together, the same.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a cycle.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing existing
is the void in the center.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:84%
This pattern inside,
taking this Merkabah,

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:90%
that creates the cube.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:84%
When we cut it in the middle,
we have the Star of David.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.970 align:middle line:84%
The Star of David
would be the symbol

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to help us recognize that
we are trinities in matter.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So some cultures took
the Star of David

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:06.010 align:middle line:84%
like a symbol to understand
that we are vibration, energy,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.535 align:middle line:90%
matter, will, love, and wisdom.

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.350 align:middle line:84%
By taking the spinning
of this Merkabah

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:84%
we will have the main
line that aligns the self.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.310 align:middle line:84%
This alignment of the self
would be the central code

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
that creates the spinning
of every one of the chakras.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And when all these
chakras are aligned

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
from the heart, the
center of the system,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
there is another light
that goes to the expansion

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, not only
vertical, but also horizontal.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And then not only the relation
would be from the creator

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.402 align:middle line:84%
to the creation,
but also helping

00:21:55.402 --> 00:21:56.860 align:middle line:84%
to understand that,
from the heart,

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.655 align:middle line:84%
we can become our own
creators of our own reality.

00:21:59.655 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Then we have this star that
is shining in the center,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:90%
by the Star of David.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And when we see
that shape, we will

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
find the shape of
the taurus around,

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.080 align:middle line:90%
creating half of the moon.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the Islam symbol and
that every religion in its core

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Muslim, Hebrew, Christianity,
and all the other religions,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:84%
like in South America,
like in Egypt--

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:42.440 align:middle line:84%
they all have the symbols
coming from the Protiktah.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:48.200 align:middle line:10%
So from this cross that
the Christians have,

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:10%
from the main core
of the system,

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:10%
the energy goes and flows
towards the outside,

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:10%
and going back to the main
core to recreate constantly

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:10%
the same energy.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's create
the key of life.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.980 align:middle line:84%
The symbol of the key
of life is the one

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that connects the whole
pattern of energy.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:13.160 align:middle line:10%
And also, by
connecting the spheres

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:10%
touching every one
of the nodes, we

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.900 align:middle line:10%
have the flower
of life, which is

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:10%
the symbol that connects
biology, and connects

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:10%
every geometry, and
every code of life.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Protiktah
coming from the void,

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.330 align:middle line:84%
projecting its
reality as a machine--

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
it's the symbol that
puts together everything.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
It is the symbol
that puts together

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:84%
every belief, every reality,
every science, every religion,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.570 align:middle line:84%
every spirituality,
the soul, the motion.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything has its place in
that machine that we call life.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, why are they
all scattered across the world

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
with different meanings, with a
neverending belief system that

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.625 align:middle line:90%
they will never be as one?

00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> In the third dimension,
the concepts are all divided.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:90%
They are all spread.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:90%
That's why we call it sciences.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:90%
We call it religions.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:84%
We call it philosophies,
spirituality.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:84%
We call it all
separated because,

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.810 align:middle line:84%
in the third dimension, we
see everything separated.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can go at any
one of those paths,

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and you will find coherence.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the step
of enlightenment.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a step when
you understand,

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.710 align:middle line:84%
when you connect
with all the ideas.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And we think that technology
is the only answer.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And for the ancients, this
technology was spiritual.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:84%
In order to get to the
awareness of how to use this,

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
you needed to be
someone spiritual.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And by spiritual, it
doesn't mean to believe.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean to
have a religion.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean to
have someone that

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.370 align:middle line:90%
is the plan in the universe.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:84%
By spiritual, it
means to be coherent,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.820 align:middle line:84%
to be someone that really
is in balance with what he

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:90%
or she does, feel, and think.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.160 align:middle line:10%
So this is why those machines
shouldn't be turned on

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.000 align:middle line:10%
in these times, because we
would use it to destroy, and not

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:10%
to find the balance.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that one day
we could look at the symbols

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of the world without the meaning
we have attached to them?

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:10%
Matias suggests
that, if we could,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:10%
our world would
be much different.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be a faster way to
connect everything to evolve

00:25:55.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:middle line:84%
as a society very fast,
because our technology would be

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years
ahead in evolution,

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:84%
because we could understand
how to create everything,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:84%
how to download
everything, like Tesla did.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
He understood about
all these codes

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.670 align:middle line:84%
precisely, because
the third dimension

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:25.370 align:middle line:84%
is just one perception of
this aspect of the Protiktah.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> If these codes are left
dormant until we can figure out

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:84%
how to spiritually
connect with this device,

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.780 align:middle line:84%
could there be more clues of
how to navigate this spiritual

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:90%
journey?

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden points out
that mysterious new symbols

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
have been uncovered
in South America.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:52.050 align:middle line:10%
>> We know of 23 ancient scripts
that have yet to be understood.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:10%
And we can only
begin to imagine what

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:10%
it is, the secrets
that they hold,

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:10%
and what they are telling
us about our relationship

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:10%
to ourselves, to the Earth,
and beyond the Earth,

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.160 align:middle line:10%
if they were left
to us by beings

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.910 align:middle line:10%
who are so sophisticated that
they were able to communicate

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:10%
with ideograms,
streamline compactly, very

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:10%
efficiently, without the
use of cumbersome alphabets

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:10%
and entire sentences and
paragraphs to explain what

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:10%
it is that they were sharing.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever these
ancient scripts might be,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:84%
they speak to something that we
have not been able to crack yet

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.662 align:middle line:90%
or, perhaps, understand.

00:27:33.662 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people today are
interested in extraterrestrial

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:90%
disclosure.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.320 align:middle line:10%
But one of the great questions
is, how will we communicate

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:10%
with extraterrestrial beings?

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:10%
Will they speak English?

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:10%
Probably not, so
we're going to have

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.725 align:middle line:10%
to find some other
method of communicating.

00:27:47.725 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:10%
And that's going to
be through symbols.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.780 align:middle line:10%
We're going to have,
perhaps, a common symbol

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.170 align:middle line:10%
set that will be able to
ultimately use as a primer,

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:10%
at first, that will be able
to be elaborated into a more

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:10%
complex way to communicate.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.700 align:middle line:10%
