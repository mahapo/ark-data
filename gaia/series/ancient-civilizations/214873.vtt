side of this mysterious

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.660 align:middle line:84%
continent holds a collection

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.740 align:middle line:84%
mainstream and
alternative researchers.

to the megalithic construction
found in Bolivia and Peru,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:84%
this anomalous
land has been home

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to several ancient
civilizations.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%

Peru is becoming an
epicenter of archeology.

Why was this land chosen
by our ancient ancestors?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Did these mighty civilizations
work with other species

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
to energize the power
of this sacred land?

As the archeological
evidence mounts,

understanding of the rise
of human civilizations?

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:10%
>> In the mid-20th century, the
thinking that was taught in all

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:10%
the schools throughout
Western civilization was that

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:10%
civilization itself began in a
place that is called the Tigris

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Euphrates.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.480 align:middle line:84%
New discoveries now have
changed that thinking.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And rather than a single
cradle of civilization,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.810 align:middle line:84%
scientists now
believe that there

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:84%
were as many as seven
simultaneous cradles

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:90%
of civilization.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Those cradles are Mesopotamia
and the Tigris Euphrates, number

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
1; India, and number 2; China,
number 3; Egypt, number 4;

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Europe, number 5; Mesoamerica,
number 6; and Peru, number 7.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:10%
Peru may be one
of the last places

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:10%
where we find so
many of the mysteries

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:10%
of our past undisturbed,
unexcavated.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Civilization has
not found its way

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.250 align:middle line:84%
into the Peruvian mountains
the way it has into Europe,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.210 align:middle line:90%
into North America.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And for that reason,
we're only beginning

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
to understand
precisely what Peru

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
means in these cradles
of civilization.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:10%
>> When you get to South America
and you enter countries such

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.580 align:middle line:10%
as Peru and Bolivia that we know
are full of these incredible

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.790 align:middle line:10%
ancient ruins, you become aware
of just how strange the mindsets

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:10%
of these people in the
past actually were.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
peoples that go back

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.080 align:middle line:90%
many, many thousands of years.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Some would even suggest
as many as 10,000 years.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that you're
dealing with something

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.516 align:middle line:90%
wholly different.

00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:35.025 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Peru seems to be one of these
rural grid points in antiquity,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.180 align:middle line:10%
where there was a lot
of activity going on.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.560 align:middle line:84%
The Peruvian Incan myths
talk about interaction

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:90%
with these star beings.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that
this area of Peru

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:84%
was a major hub, almost like
a galactic airport for beings

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.865 align:middle line:84%
coming in and out of the
Earth, settling, doing trade.

00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to start looking
at who these ancient Peruvians,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.420 align:middle line:84%
who these ancient Bolivian
peoples actually were,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
where they came from, whether
they truly are the Indigenous

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.320 align:middle line:84%
peoples of this area, or whether
they themselves may have had

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:84%
help from outside,
from elsewhere.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.110 align:middle line:10%
>> In ancient South America,
there are so many Indigenous

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:10%
cultures that we've barely
scratched the surface

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:10%
in understanding who
these people were,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:10%
what their beliefs were,
what their practices were,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.425 align:middle line:10%
and why they did the
things that they did.

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Look at what the ancestors,
particularly the Aymara,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:10%
one of the oldest people on the
planet that no one ever gives

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:10%
any credit to.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Only 9,000 people left.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
They have an invented
language, which the syntax can

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:90%
be understood by a computer.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, where did that come from?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:10%
Aymara did not develop
as an organic language.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:84%
It appears fully
developed, with a syntax

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.310 align:middle line:90%
that a computer can understand?

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.075 align:middle line:90%
That's not local.

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> What this tells us is that
there are incredible mysteries

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.803 align:middle line:84%

into the landscape.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%

Chariots of The Gods,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%

in particular the Nazca lines.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
They're one of the most
enigmatic mysteries

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Why were they created?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Why do they look
like runways that

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
could have been used by
extraterrestrials visiting

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:90%
this planet?

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.723 align:middle line:90%
>> These lines are gigantic.

00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:10%
You know, there are
two sorts of lines--

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:10%
small ones, just 1 meter
large, and large ones,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.890 align:middle line:10%
which are 30 meters large.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, the longest
of the small lines

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
is 23 kilometers on one line
over hills and mountains

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:90%
straight away, going directly.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Then the so-called
large lines, the locals,

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
they speak Spanish there,
they call it "las pistas,"

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.730 align:middle line:90%
the pistas, the airstrips.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%
They look like airstrips.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And these airstrips,
these pieces are gigantic.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.605 align:middle line:84%
That's the real
mystery of Nazca.

00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:54.772 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.772 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Another mystery from the
ancient Peruvian past was

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:90%
unearthed in Paracas.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
In 1927, archeologist
Julio Tello

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.770 align:middle line:84%
recovered hundreds
of elongated skulls

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:90%
from this desert peninsula.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Tello's discovery
created new questions

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
around the potential
extraterrestrial influence

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Peru.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.260 align:middle line:10%
>> What's so interesting about
this is if it were one or two

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:10%
skulls, then scientists could
say, OK, it's an anomaly.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a one-off.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we
are still finding

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
these skulls and
the characteristics

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:90%
that they show us.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:10%
For example, we know that
these skulls typically

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:10%
do not have the sutures that
a human skull will have.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
These are the places where
the soft bones of an infant

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
come together.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:54.700 align:middle line:84%
They move so that when the baby
passes through the birth canal,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.630 align:middle line:84%
the head can conform
to the birth canal

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and the mother can
survive the process.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
What we find in
the Paracas skulls

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
is those sutures
are not possible,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.120 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that these
beings may not have

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.805 align:middle line:90%
been the product of live birth.

00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> In Paracas, what was
found was that when you look

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
at the skulls of these gods,
is that the cubic capacity

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
of the skulls is much
greater than the human skull.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Now you can deform the
shape of a baby's head

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
by sitting there
with a piece of cloth

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and slowly squeezing the skull
while it's still forming.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that when you look

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
at those skulls in the museums,
they look like coneheads,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's no other
way to describe it.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:90%
But these skulls are different.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:84%
They're unusual,
that's for sure.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:84%
But there's an
elegance about them,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:84%
as though there was part
of a genetic makeup.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And it does turn
out that, yes, you

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.640 align:middle line:84%
can extend the
shape of the skull,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:84%
but you can't change the
cubic capacity of the skull.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And these skulls, which still
have the red hair firmly

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.900 align:middle line:84%
attached on them, are 30%
greater cubic capacity,

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:84%
which means we're dealing
with someone who is human-like

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.532 align:middle line:90%
but not quite human.

00:09:03.532 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that these skulls
have been found in other parts

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:90%
of the world as well.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And what the historians
typically say,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
is that the people of the time
will deform the baby skulls

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
intentionally to make it look
like the skulls of beings that

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
have been with them
in the past, that

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:84%
had abilities, that had powers,
that had insights and knowledge.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And the thinking is if they
could make their babies' heads

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
look like those
with the abilities

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:84%
that their babies will
have those abilities.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> With the discovery
of the elongated skulls,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
the Paracas skulls in the 1920s,
it really started to get us

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
to wonder if there was an
extraterrestrial influence upon

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:90%
the ancient peoples of Peru.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:10%
Could it be this is why
the ancient people are

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:10%
so difficult to understand,
because maybe they

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:10%
had an extraterrestrial
influence guiding

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.443 align:middle line:10%
the course of
their civilization,

00:09:57.443 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:10%
and that's something
we just don't quite

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.784 align:middle line:10%
understand in today's world?

00:10:02.784 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:10%
>> The Paracas skull seems
to be an incredible link

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:10%
to an otherworldly civilization
that has a desire to bump up

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:10%
humanity,
intellectually speaking.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:10%
The human brain, throughout
history, and especially when

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:10%
you look at the history
of our interaction

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.440 align:middle line:10%
with extraterrestrial
civilizations

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:10%
and their augmentation
of the human body,

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:10%
it's the brain where they're
focusing their effort.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
We know that 200,000 years ago,
the neocortex of the brain was

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:90%
mysteriously activated.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
It's been proposed cosmic rays,
group sex, eating proteins,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic mushrooms were
all the trigger for that.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
another perspective

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
that it was the fusing
of two chromosomes that

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:90%
enabled that activation.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important
because without the activation

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
of the neocortex, we don't have
civilization as we know it.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:10%
All our art, our science, music,
all of civilization and culture

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:10%
drops out of this
activation of the neocortex.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.830 align:middle line:90%
What if that was just the start?

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
What if they themselves were
this super advanced civilization

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that entered into
the Earth plane,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
and they're the ones with
this extreme cranial capacity,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
as evidenced by, say,
the Paracas skull,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and this is what they
ultimately envision for us?

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Does Peru hold the
secrets of the past?

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:10%
I think the recent research
done there can unlock something,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:10%
and it's going to
be a key that could

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:10%
be changing the world
and our perception

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:10%
of the people of the past.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And could it be that there
was this intervention

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:50.140 align:middle line:84%
many, many centuries ago to make
the Paracas skulls elongated?

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:90%
What's their DNA as well?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.453 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we have yet another
mystery rising out of Peru.

00:11:56.453 --> 00:12:00.936 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.936 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2016, a discovery was made
in a cave near Nazca that caught

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
the attention of
journalist Jaime Maussan.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:84%
This began a thorough
investigation

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.900 align:middle line:84%
into a potential new species
that once inhabited this land.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:10%
>> In October-November 2016, I
saw some videos through internet

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:10%
and YouTube of this man in Peru
presenting little bodies that

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:10%
didn't look human.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:10%
He presented a huge hand.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:10%
It didn't look human.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:10%
He said that they were found
in a tomb in the middle

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:10%
of the desert near Nazca.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:10%
Then I didn't pay
attention because I

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:10%
thought they were fakes.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:10%
It was a hoax.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:10%
I don't like it.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:10%
I don't feel right when
someone wants to be anonymous.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:57.530 align:middle line:10%
But in March 2017, a biologist
called me and said, Jaime,

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:10%
look at this.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:10%
This is very interesting.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I have
to go to Peru.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:10%
Then I got involved with Gaia.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:10%
And I said, Gaia, do you
want to come with me?

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.370 align:middle line:10%
Because this is good,
this is important.

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:10%
And I think we could
go with cameras

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:10%
and try to document this.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Joining Dr. Konstantin
Korotkov from Russia,

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Jaime and a small group were
taken to a secret location near

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Nazca.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:10%
>> And we have a very
important mission here in Peru.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:10%
I came here together with
a group of scientists,

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:10%
professionals, journalists,
because we were supposed to see

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.125 align:middle line:10%
maybe one of the most important
discovery of the 21st century.

00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The team was shown the
well-preserved skeletal remains

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
of the body, now
referred to as María.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Though several sections of the
body strongly resembled a human,

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the elongated skull and the
anomalies of her three fingers

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and toes immediately changed
the implications and importance

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.195 align:middle line:90%
of this discovery.

00:14:11.195 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:10%
>> It can change the
consciousness of humanity

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:10%
as a whole.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:10%
And all our concepts about
history, about development,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.860 align:middle line:10%
those are just concepts.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:10%
And this opens up absolutely
new page of history.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.520 align:middle line:10%
No doubts that it is a
tremendous discovery.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.760 align:middle line:10%
In our research with María's
body, we had several steps.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:10%
Our first step was to
prove that it's real,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:10%
that it's not plastic.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:10%
It's not paper,
and it's ancient.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:51.200 align:middle line:10%
So we did carbon
dating and, of course,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.400 align:middle line:10%
we did analysis of
structural body from CAT scan

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:10%
and from X-ray.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:10%
So it was proven
that it's real body.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.400 align:middle line:10%
But how about three fingers?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.540 align:middle line:10%
How about three toes?

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:10%
Maybe this is artificial.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.610 align:middle line:10%
Maybe this is just
attached, somehow.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:10%
I was able to get a sample from
a finger and from toe of María,

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:10%
and we made extra
analysis of these samples.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:10%
And very important was proven
that this same material,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:10%
it is same chemical
composition, it's same DNA.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:10%
So we have no doubts now that
fingers, three fingers, three

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.261 align:middle line:10%
toes, it belongs to this body.

00:15:32.261 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Bones of any
mammalian skeleton,

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:10%
they are incredibly complex,
which is a good thing for this

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:10%
because they are going to be
extremely hard to reproduce.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:10%
Looking at this
skeleton, obviously we

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:10%
have a fairly
humanoid-looking bone.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:10%
We've got the eyes that
are facing forward.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:10%
You can see rows of teeth
both above and below.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.020 align:middle line:10%
The shape of the
skull is interesting.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
It's very elongated, an atypical
appearance of a human skull

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.880 align:middle line:90%
like you and I know.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the rest
of the skeleton,

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
we have a thoracic spine that's
holding the ribs or your rib

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:90%
cage of the chest.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.740 align:middle line:84%
All of that looks
very humanoid as well.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Femurs, we have the tibia
and fibula, all of that

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:90%
is pretty typical.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And then even in
the forearm here,

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
you have bones called
the radius and ulna.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's
interesting here is we

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
see there is a
collection of bones here.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:84%
This is called the
carpus of the wrist.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:90%
That's a typical appearance.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But as we move outward,
we're seeing really

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
three distinct fingers,
which is fascinating.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.640 align:middle line:84%
The skull, I don't
see any suture lines.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
There's no bones that are
separate in the skull.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:90%
They all appear fused.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:03.702 align:middle line:10%
So this appears to be a
solid, solid structure.

00:17:03.702 --> 00:17:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The first DNA test results
revealed that the white

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.660 align:middle line:84%
substance preserving the
body was diatomaceous earth,

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and that María was, in
fact, an organic specimen.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:84%
The isolation of
the X-chromosome

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:90%
identified María as female.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
The carbon-14 testing done in
Mexico revealed that María was

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:84%
alive roughly 1,600
to 1,700 years ago,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
in the period of
the Nazca culture.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle line:10%
United States-based testing
revealed roughly the same dating

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.070 align:middle line:10%
of María as being
1,700 years old.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:10%
>> From the first DNA
analysis, it was proven that

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.640 align:middle line:10%
it's human-like DNA.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.750 align:middle line:10%
It was proven, because we
know that now we have three

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:10%
types of human-like creatures.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:10%
It is Neanderthals,
Cro-magnons like ourselves,

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:10%
and Denisovan men.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:10%
With Denisovan men, they had
practically our skull, our type

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:10%
of skull, no big difference.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:10%
But it was proven that they
have different type of DNA,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:10%
so that's why they were defined
as another type of human beings.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, at next level,
they have to make

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:10%
much more detailed analysis and
much more complicated analysis.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:10%
So they will create
a library of genes,

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:10%
and then they will be able to
compare this library of genes

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:10%
with a database
of human subjects.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.080 align:middle line:10%
Then we'll see whether
it is exactly human-like

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:10%
or it is a little bit different.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Konstantin, Jaime, and a team
of scientists returned to Peru

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
to conduct further research
on María and take more samples

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:90%
for DNA testing.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They were looking to compare
these samples with a larger

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:84%
genetic database,
searching for a match

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
with any modern human
species or any other known

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:90%
species on the planet.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.420 align:middle line:84%
The DNA results from the
second samples taken from María

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
were tested in Saint
Petersburg, Russia,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and concluded that all samples
from the fingers, toes, and body

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:84%
of María belonged
to the same species,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and the body was not
artificially constructed.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:10%
>> The beings from which
the samples were taken,

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:10%
from which the DNA was analyzed
are not of any known terrestrial

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:10%
origin.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't appear to match
any species on Earth.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:10%
So of the DNA that was
isolated, only 25% of the total

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:10%
matched any known human gene.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:10%
The DNA results
were not at all--

00:19:55.630 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:10%
support the idea that these were
human remains that were altered.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:10%
There's no support to
conclude that it's a hoax.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:10%
Individuals who are not
basing that off of data,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:10%
they're basing that off of
their opinion and perspective.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, based on my
opinion and perspective,

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
which I feel is
informed by the data,

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I see strong
indications that suggest

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
it's an authentic, anomalous
remains of unknown origin.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a wow.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely surprising, yeah.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:10%
>> After we received this
high-resolution images, María,

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.310 align:middle line:10%
she's human-like.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:41.780 align:middle line:10%
First of all, details of her
skull, anatomy of the skull.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:10%
Second, of course,
fingers, and toes.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:10%
So if you go step by step, then,
of course, first the skull.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:54.820 align:middle line:10%
On the skull, we see
that she has no ears.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:21:00.490 align:middle line:10%
And construction of her ear
bones different from us.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:10%
This is the first
main conclusion.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.050 align:middle line:10%
Then construction of
skull itself, it's

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:10%
a little bit different.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:10%
Of course, it is
elongated skull.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.220 align:middle line:10%
Maybe not as elongated
as we can see in Paracas,

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:10%
but still it is elongated.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:10%
It is more elongated compared
with our rounded skull.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Second, different
construction of bones of nose.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.180 align:middle line:10%
But all other topics of
the skull are very similar.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:39.280 align:middle line:10%
We don't have a lower
part of the body,

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:45.910 align:middle line:10%
so neither organs of
reproduction, nor liver,

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:10%
nor kidneys.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:10%
It's strange, but this
came to some conclusions

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:10%
that maybe she was
attacked by some animal.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:10%
And Professor Galetsky
was able to find tracks

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:10%
of claws, fangs on her body.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:10%
And all this low part of her
body is just, is taken away.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:10%
And then we see some
parts of particle

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:10%
that may be related to blood.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:10%
But it is absolutely
clear that we

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:10%
are facing with very
exciting situation,

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:10%
because all data
that we have tells us

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.270 align:middle line:10%
that it's not human-like.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:10%
It's not just simple
mutation, but it's

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.000 align:middle line:10%
another type of human species.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:10%
We don't know whether it
was some line of humans

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:10%
with elongated
skulls who was living

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.790 align:middle line:10%
on the Earth for
maybe millenniums.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:10%
But I'm sure that
it will open up

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.305 align:middle line:10%
a new page of human history
a new page of civilization

00:22:50.305 --> 00:22:51.105 align:middle line:10%
history.

00:22:51.105 --> 00:22:57.636 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.636 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>> When we see mummies like the
ones that have been discovered

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
recently in Nazca, we see
references to beings that

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%
don't look quite human.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how
did they get here?

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Many people assume they
came in physical vehicles,

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and there is a search for those
vehicles that has not yielded

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.220 align:middle line:90%
much in Peru to this day.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to
the shaman, you talk

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:84%
to the locals and
their traditions,

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
they tell the story of an
even deeper technology.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Not a machine that carries
us from point A to point B,

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:40.060 align:middle line:84%
rather a portal that allows
us to transcend the distances

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:90%
of time and space, a stargate.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.580 align:middle line:84%
We see evidence
of these stargates

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:90%
near Lake Titicaca in Peru.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:53.200 align:middle line:10%
We find carved into the
high quartz sandstone

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.280 align:middle line:10%
cliffs, a doorway to
nowhere, that even today

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:10%
is a sacred place for
the Indigenous people

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:10%
who come and give offerings and
await their ancestors, they say

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.931 align:middle line:10%
will pass back and forth
through this portal in time.

00:24:10.931 --> 00:24:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> If in Nazca we find
really some mixed creatures,

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:84%
then we would find a proof
of extraterrestrials,

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and I will be the
first one to be very,

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.280 align:middle line:84%
very happy because I'm accused
by the scientific community

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.557 align:middle line:84%
since 60 years that there
are no extraterrestrials.

00:24:28.557 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And if they would
be, they would never

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
come here because of the
distance, et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So I would be happy to support,
yes, finally, we have a proof.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But in our scientific
community, they

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
do not accept extraterrestrial
life on Earth.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:10%
Extraterrestrials in our
scientific community,

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:10%
including in our media, is
still something to be ridiculed.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> With the Peruvian
anomalies mounting,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
the mysterious beings depicted
by ancient artists raise more

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
questions about the presence of
an alternative species that may

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.980 align:middle line:90%
have worked within the planet.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The art of Peru is
particularly strange.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, one odd
character that appears again

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and again is what is
known to the archeologists

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:90%
as "the harvester."

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.590 align:middle line:10%
This is a mythical being
that is often shown

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:10%
with seeds and agriculture.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.110 align:middle line:84%
But what's so strange
about this figure

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:84%
is that it's
generally always shown

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:84%
with three fingers
and three toes.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Is this some simplification of
the depiction of the human form?

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:10%
Or does it represent some kind
of being that actually had

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:10%
three fingers and three toes?

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at these
depictions of the harvesters,

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:84%
we cannot help but notice a
strong similarity to the Nazca

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:84%
mummy named María, meaning the
long slender bodies with a large

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:84%
head where there's no ears and
three fingers on each hand.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And that opens a wide array of
questions like, who was María?

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Where does she come from?

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:84%
We look to her
genetics and we see

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:84%
there's a good portion of
it is similar to humans,

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.300 align:middle line:84%
but there's another
portion that is unknown.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So we wonder now, was María
part-human part something else?

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Or is María strictly a
harvester with these harvesters

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:84%
a different sort of
being that interacted

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient
cultures of Peru?

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And so this opens
the mysteries that we

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.562 align:middle line:84%
need to explore to
an even deeper level.

00:26:40.562 --> 00:26:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I was talking to the local
archeologists, and I asked them,

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:84%
why do so many mummies or
skeletons have three fingers?

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.808 align:middle line:84%
And they say, because
they were not humans.

00:26:51.808 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:84%
The three fingers, they
say they were not humans.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.550 align:middle line:84%
At least that's what
some archeologists say.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But again, other
archeologists contradict.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, we have these
figures with three fingers.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Terrestrials have five fingers.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And everyone knew this,
including in the past.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Why did somebody make some
humans with three fingers?

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We have no answer, I think,
because they represent

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.772 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials.

00:27:17.772 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> My job mainly was reverse
engineering controls and craft.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:10%
I know of probably
five or six races

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:10%
that all have three fingers.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.470 align:middle line:10%
I would say probably most
of the aliens have three.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Almost all of what we
would call flying saucers

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
had control panels that were
for three-fingered beings.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.015 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.015 --> 00:27:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking at the mysterious
anomalies of Peru,

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:84%
like the unexplainable
sites, the elongated skulls,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
even the Nazca lines, it
suggests that there already was

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial influence
upon their civilizations.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
discovery of María

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.180 align:middle line:84%

We're only beginning

to accept the story
that they tell?
