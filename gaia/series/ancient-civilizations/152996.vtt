>> We're here today to announce
the first synthetic cell.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.378 align:middle line:10%
As soon as we had
these two sequences,

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:48.420 align:middle line:10%
we thought if this is
supposed to be the smallest

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:10%
genome of a
self-replicating species,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:10%
could there be even
a smaller genome?

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Could we understand the
basis of cellular life

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.055 align:middle line:90%
at the genetic level?

00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> On May 21, 2010, this
historic announcement was made

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.620 align:middle line:84%
by Craig Venter on the
first fully-functioning,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
reproducing cell controlled
by synthetic DNA.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Every protein of this cell
was based on a synthetic code

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.660 align:middle line:90%
they had developed.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:84%
As exciting as this
was for bringing

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
in a new era of science,
the question was posed, then

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.960 align:middle line:84%
what is life if we can just
create it through a code?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:84%
There are some experts
that have suggested

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
that an ancient blueprint
was left behind.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
In 1929, an American
archaeologist

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
named Matthew Williams
Stirling began

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:84%
suspecting that artifacts
emerging out of Mexico

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.740 align:middle line:84%
belong to a time much earlier
than the suspected Olmecs.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:84%
He concluded that these
artifacts were actually Mayan.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.130 align:middle line:84%
In 1941, Stirling unearthed
a large carved stone monument

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
in the Mesoamerican site
Izapa of Chiapas, Mexico.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:90%
He named this Stela 5.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And Stela 5 is a description.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a sketch of exactly
the type of world tree

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:84%
that keeps showing
up in different forms

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:84%
all over the world in
every indigenous culture

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.160 align:middle line:90%
you look for.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's a
very common element that we

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:84%
see in the Mayan
version are birds

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:90%
that are nesting in a tree.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Then there's also the belief
that in the upper part

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.793 align:middle line:84%
of the tree, it represents
the tangible manifest world.

00:02:34.793 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the area
of the tree that

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
goes below the
surface of the Earth

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.380 align:middle line:90%
represents the underworld.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan tree of life depicts
the oneness of humanity,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:84%
that we all come
from the same root,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and that we've all branched
out to become one of many.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The Mayan tree of life may
not look like a coded depiction

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:90%
for the human genome.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:84%
However, researchers
started mapping its imagery.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.890 align:middle line:84%
They counted 12 human
figures, a dozen animals,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.310 align:middle line:84%
over 25 botanical or
inanimate objects,

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and 9 stylized deity masks
carved into the stone.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Given the multiple
overlapping scenes,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:90%
it appears to be a narrative.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:90%
But what is the narrative?

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And could Stirling's
suggestion that these images

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
belonged to a much older
culture be just the beginning

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.326 align:middle line:90%
of its origin?

00:03:29.326 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's go back
to the garden of Eden.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
In the garden of Eden,
there are actually

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:90%
two trees of significance.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.990 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the tree of
knowledge of good and evil,

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
which Adam and Eve eat from,
thus entering into a state

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
where they may begin to make
responsible choices for which

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
they will have to
bear the costs.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And the other is
the tree of life.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
When the demiurge
drives Adam and Eve out

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:84%
of the garden of Eden,
he states his motive.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:90%
And the motive is kind of eerie.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:90%
He says, this has to be done.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
They have to be driven
out of the garden of Eden.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
They've eaten of the tree of
knowledge of good and evil.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The next thing they will do
is eat of the tree of life.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
become gods like us.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:84%
That statement is
actually in Genesis.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:10%
What on Earth is going on there?

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Is there some deeply buried
secret of transcendence

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that demiurgic and
archonic forces have

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:90%
concealed from us from so long?

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Is there a tree of life?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
beyond what we

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
think of as the
span of human life,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.002 align:middle line:84%
some eternity that
is offered to us?

00:04:57.002 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:10%
>> One meaning that people give
to it is that it was the tree

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:10%
that leads to
physical immortality.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the old
Mesopotamian writings,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:10%
one of the big conflicts
between humans and the gods

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:10%
was the gods did not want
humanity to have immortality.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:10%
Most people interpret that
to be physical immortality,

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.980 align:middle line:10%
that we live and die too soon.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It goes too quickly.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile,
the gods were said

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:84%
to have lived 20,000 years,
or 50,000 years, or longer.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.010 align:middle line:90%
So why not humans?

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that
humans were perhaps

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:84%
programmed that way to die
more quickly so they couldn't

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.750 align:middle line:90%
be like the gods.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the tree of life,
by that interpretation,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
would be that this is
the formula or this

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.470 align:middle line:84%
is the knowledge for how you
attain that much longer time

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.975 align:middle line:90%
span physically.

00:05:51.975 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the greatest mysteries
of the Sumerian civilization

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and the artifacts that have been
found from that civilization is

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:90%
the ancient Sumerian kings list.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
They identify the time
of the Great Flood

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
that is almost universal in
every indigenous tradition I've

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:90%
ever studied.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:10%
And the length of time of the
rulers from that time into more

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:10%
present times is right on.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:90%
It is very accurate.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And where this gets
really interesting,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:84%
the names of the rulers, the
time that they ruled on Earth,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
the lengths of their reigns
are all within reason.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that
time, we're looking

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
at kings who are
said to have ruled

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
for periods of time of thousands
and thousands of years.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So for example, the
very first king listed

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.350 align:middle line:84%
is said to have ruled
for 28,000 years.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these Sumerian gods or
rulers have been able to live

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:90%
for 28,000 years at some point?

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Or is this just another
meaning for something else

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.681 align:middle line:90%
carved into the stone?

00:07:05.681 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Another interpretation of the
tree of life is that it meant

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:84%
the awareness of
spiritual immortality,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that humans would go
through this lifetime.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.300 align:middle line:84%
They go through
this between lives.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's a memory loss.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And then they get reincarnated.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And they've forgotten
all of the past.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And so now they feel like, oh,
life is just 70, 80, 90 years,

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.160 align:middle line:84%
not realizing, no, it's this
whole continuum that goes back

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
thousands, hundreds
of thousands,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.270 align:middle line:90%
maybe millions of years.

>> In Sumerian Eden texts,
just like in the Bible,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:10%
we find two trees, the tree
of life and the tree of good

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:10%
and evil.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life
refers to eternal life.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
As far as the truly inaccessible
tree of life is concerned,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:84%
it relates to ways for people
to achieve transcendence.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:90%
same concept.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, throughout
many cultures,

>> The Mayan tree of life
is a very good example

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
of the concept of
the cosmic tree,

the tree from which life
and creation emerges from.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It would seem to
exist, essentially,

in the center of the world.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.995 align:middle line:10%
Out from it went the four
different directions,

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:53.477 align:middle line:10%
each of which had four different
colors associated with them.

00:08:53.477 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And in each of those
directions, there

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:90%
were different clans and tribes.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
This shouldn't be
seen in isolation

had the sacred tree Yggdrasil.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And they believe it connected
the world of the gods

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
with the world of humans and
then down to the underworld.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Indian spiritual
texts, the Bhagavad Gita,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
speaks of a tree of life
with its roots going up

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:90%
and its branches going down.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
The essential
thing to understand

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:59.240 align:middle line:84%
is that the real self
is the conscious self.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And the physical body, be it
a human body or a plant body

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:12.230 align:middle line:84%
or an animal body, is a vehicle
for that conscious self, which

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.107 align:middle line:84%
originally existed
as a divine spark

00:10:16.107 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:90%
on the higher level of reality.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.750 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
main Gnostic teachings.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So that means as long as there
has been a material world,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
human beings and
other conscious selves

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
have been part of
the tree of life

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
here for millions or
even billions of years.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If there is a universal tree
of life depiction in almost all

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:84%
these different cultures, then
how do we decipher the code

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.062 align:middle line:90%
in its branches?

00:10:53.062 --> 00:10:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>> "Hamlet's Mill," it describes
a continuity that seems almost

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.090 align:middle line:84%
impossible to believe between
mythologies all over the world.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they combined 35
different geographically

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.290 align:middle line:84%
isolated, in most cases,
mythological traditions

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and showed that there
was an underlying

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:90%
commonality between them all.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the common
themes that you hear about

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:84%
in "Hamlet's Mill" is the idea
of a mill for grinding grain,

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:90%
where there is a central axis.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.882 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this millstone
with a rod going through it.

00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
There is a hole in the
middle of the millstone.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And you grind it
around in circles.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.962 align:middle line:84%
And it grinds up the
grain into flour.

00:11:27.962 --> 00:11:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the strange thing is
that the mythology shows up

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.760 align:middle line:84%
in different ways
around the world.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And most of the common ways that
Santillana and von Dechend talk

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:90%
about is the world tree.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So instead of it
being an actual axle

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:84%
of a mill for grinding
grain, now you

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:90%
have a central trunk of a tree.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.910 align:middle line:10%
And the tree is
actually something

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:10%
that fits into the same
mythological concept

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:10%
as Santillana and von
Dechend are talking about.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
mythological concept?

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:84%
The myths always
seem to describe

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.060 align:middle line:84%
some sort of spontaneous
metamorphosis of the human

00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.138 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But how does a human
form spontaneously?

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
the tree represents

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
an even deeper understanding of
how we were created as humans?

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
>> According to my research,
the tree of life depicts

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.870 align:middle line:84%
the frequency that
DNA oscillates at.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Everything is made out of
a frequency or vibration.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:84%
The wall behind me
is all vibration.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.760 align:middle line:84%
You could stick
your hand through it

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:84%
if you were able to
match that vibration.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
All genetics have a
vibratory signature that

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.890 align:middle line:90%
can be picked up by technology.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.983 align:middle line:84%
And the secret
space programs are

00:12:33.983 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
able to use this
type of frequency

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to detect different
types of life

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.343 align:middle line:90%
just by their genetic frequency.

00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:42.121 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.121 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> If DNA has its own frequency,
then how can it be manipulated

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:90%
and changed?

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>> We are gods.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:90%
We forget this connection.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
understand that,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:84%
the more you actually become
aware of your position in life.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.685 align:middle line:10%
I think that's where
the interaction is

00:12:57.685 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:10%
between the tree of knowledge
and the tree of life.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.225 align:middle line:10%
One leads to the other.

00:13:01.225 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you follow that
through in terms of genetics,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.040 align:middle line:10%
the more you come to understand
who you are as a temple

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:10%
and as a god.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
You begin to alter the chemical
structure of your own DNA.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:84%
It actually starts
to alter who you are.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that we
now know in modern physics.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, you can see
there's a tree of life

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
because it means
that you actually

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:90%
are altering your very own DNA.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Your own thoughts, and
your own belief patterns

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:90%
do alter your DNA.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It only takes a small change
in the local electromagnetic

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.165 align:middle line:84%
environment to alter the
information received by DNA.

00:13:35.165 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Were the gods afraid that
we could be able to manipulate

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:90%
our own DNA?

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And if so, could
the tree symbology

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:48.435 align:middle line:84%
be a blueprint for this
inevitable knowledge?

00:13:48.435 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:10%
>> The world tree symbology also
has a very interesting parallel

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:10%
in actual physics.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Only recently have
we really started

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to understand the value
of the significance

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:90%
of the spherical torus.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
If you have a vector moving
through a fluid medium,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.120 align:middle line:84%
meaning if you just have a
force moving through a fluid,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.920 align:middle line:84%
as the force moves,
it will naturally

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
cause a torus to form.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:84%
The torus is a
curling of the fluid

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:90%
as a vector moves through it.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
We see in physical
systems, like the atom,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
that the atom is a series of
toroidal shells of electrons

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.690 align:middle line:84%
that are all concentric
with a nucleus.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:84%
In much the same
way, the world tree

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:84%
appears to have layers
of onion-like shells.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>> If the tree of life is
a representation of DNA

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
on a deeper level, where can
this be decoded in ancient

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:90%
texts?

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:10%
>> The closest thing, I believe,
on the planet right now that

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:10%
you might be able to come
across is the original Hebrew

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:10%
language, which, when
you begin to examine it,

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:10%
has 22 letters matching all
of these other ancient occult

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:10%
secrets.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.580 align:middle line:10%
And those 22 letters each
equate to a number value.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
you can construct

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:84%
words that have
a numerical value

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:84%
or a mathematical relationship
with their surroundings.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the last
surviving piece that shows us

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:90%
what that language was like.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:10%
And no, it's not
perfect by any means.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:10%
But the fact that
you can literally

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.890 align:middle line:10%
construct mathematical
equations out of words,

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:10%
and the words makes
sense, and that

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:10%
these mathematical equations
interact harmonically

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:10%
with our surroundings is
the great occult secret.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:10%
That's the occult secret
that every occult group

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:10%
has been searching for forever.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why the tree
of life, for example, where

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.260 align:middle line:10%
you have 22 paths
and each equate

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.370 align:middle line:10%
to one of the Hebrew
letters, is the basis

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:10%
of most of their
Oracle teachings.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:10%
And what we know
about DNA today that--

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:10%
they're still discovering
new things every single day.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But we know that the female
and the male human body

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:90%
share 22 chromosomes.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.230 align:middle line:10%
The 23rd are the sex chromosomes
that make us different.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.790 align:middle line:10%
The 22 is what's
interesting because DNA

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:10%
is created in a spiral.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And spirals naturally
transmit fractal energy.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:10%
What's even more
interesting is that when

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.370 align:middle line:10%
you begin to examine a lot
of the ancient cultures who

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.160 align:middle line:10%
were building these megalithic
monuments, for instance,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:10%
the pyramids at Egypt,
there are 22 pyramids along

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:10%
the causeway of peace, not the
three that they always show.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.850 align:middle line:90%
There are 22.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to study
the occult, especially

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
the Western occult
tradition that came up

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
through the Knights Templar
and into the Freemasons

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.912 align:middle line:84%
and to Crowley's
group and the OTO,

00:16:51.912 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
you begin to learn that
the 22 trumps of the Tarot

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
also match the 22 paths
on the tree of life, which

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.869 align:middle line:90%
also match the 22 pyramids.

00:17:04.869 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And they all have the same
vibrational frequency.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Interestingly enough,
the Mayan "Tree of Life"

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
carved into Stela 5 and its
depictions throughout Mayan

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:22.935 align:middle line:84%
culture also has a strange
correlation to the number 22.

00:17:22.935 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was in the Yucatan
working with the Mayan elders,

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:10%
there was an elder
that came out.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:10%
And we were having
the conversation.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.130 align:middle line:10%
And he said it's
easier if I show you.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:10%
It begins with many
branches of the tree above.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:10%
And it represents the 13
heavens that we aspire to.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:10%
Below the root system represents
what they call the nine

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:10%
levels of the underworld.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:10%
Nine hells is what the Western
tradition would call them.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:10%
And the area in
between is Earth.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the tree of life
really be a secret code

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:84%
for our physical
existence on the planet?

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
Could it explain our material
existence in this density?

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at the idea that
the planets are not just being

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:84%
held in some strange combination
of centrifugal and centripetal

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.220 align:middle line:84%
force, but there is some sort of
greater emanation from the sun

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
that's holding them in place
because their orbits should not

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:84%
be so consistent over
many thousands of years.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is what mainstream
scientists have said.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
They've had a big problem
trying to figure out,

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.537 align:middle line:84%
why do planets not lose their
energy and crash into the sun?

00:18:32.537 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I've often modeled this idea
that the planets themselves

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:84%
are on spherical layers, that
there's a spherical forcefield

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:90%
holding each planet in place.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's what determines
its orbit, which means,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.440 align:middle line:84%
if you look at our solar
system from the perspective

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.830 align:middle line:84%
of the afterlife, you would see
a series of concentric spheres

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:90%
with a central axis.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:90%
And it would look like a tree.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I find
really interesting

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
is that PMH Atwater,
in one of her books,

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
describes her own
near-death experience

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
where when she got thrown out of
her body into the solar system,

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:84%
she saw a phenomenon
of what looked

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
like a series of
umbrellas of energy.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And the central stalk of the
umbrella was where the sun is.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the world tree.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.888 align:middle line:10%
The ancient beings seem to
have left behind mythologies

00:19:12.888 --> 00:19:14.680 align:middle line:10%
like the world tree on
purpose because they

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:10%
got us closer to the
understanding of how physics

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.130 align:middle line:10%
really work.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:84%
The ubiquity of
the spherical torus

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:84%
in any type of energetic
system you're looking at--

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:84%
biological, cellular life,
molecules, the energy fields

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
of planets, the energy
fields of the solar system,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
even the energy
fields of galaxies--

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
appear to have these spherical
toroidal shapes in them.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's a trail of
breadcrumbs leading us

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.680 align:middle line:84%
down a very interesting
line of investigation.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
to understand this,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
you can no longer look
at the inscriptions

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:90%
and see them as primitive.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.144 align:middle line:84%
You say, there's something going
on here that's very powerful.

00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> If the ancient gods were
afraid that humans would eat

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:84%
from the tree of life,
and they were successful,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.290 align:middle line:84%
could someone or something
have picked up on this trail

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
of breadcrumbs and have created
their own version of our DNA?

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Reporter Linda Moulton Howe
discovered some shocking links

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:84%
to, specifically, the Mayan tree
of life and a DNA manipulation.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It was back in
the early 1980s.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.280 align:middle line:90%
I was in New York.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:10%
It was another one
of those phone calls.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.510 align:middle line:10%
Can I talk to you about--

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:10%
and this person, a
man, said that he

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:10%
had worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency, retired.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And he traveled with
another CIA colleague.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And their destination
was New Delhi in India.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And they were given detailed
instructions upon landing

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:90%
at the airport, maps.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said it was really
necessary that they

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:90%
went into this detail.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:10%
He said, in that
work, going to India,

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:10%
and knowing that we are dealing
with actual preserved material

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:10%
related to ET
technology in a body.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:09.820 align:middle line:84%
He said, we also were told that
the last major manipulation

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.350 align:middle line:84%
of DNA in already evolving
primates on this planet--

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:84%
exactly as I had seen in
that presidential briefing

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:90%
paper at Kirtland.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
It was in Bhutan in the
Himalayas 5,000 years different

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:90%
ages.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, I think the
last was 2,500 years ago.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And that was the creation
of hybrids between Bhutanese

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and something else, and
that we know-- and he said,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:90%
we have proof--

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
that the hybrids in Bhutan
were picked up by craft, UFOs,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and flown to what we would
today call the Yucatan Peninsula

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:90%
on the Gulf of Mexico.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Then that was the Mayan
civilization created

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.400 align:middle line:90%
in a hybridized program by EBE--

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrial
Biological Entities.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were put down
in the Yucatan Peninsula

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to keep them away from every
other hybridization program

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:84%
that they had on the Earth,
which included putting hybrids

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in the tops of mountains,
putting hybrids

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
on islands, peninsulas, to keep
their experiments on the Earth

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:90%
separate.

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life, at least this
is my just basic understanding,

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.510 align:middle line:84%
that the tree of life
in any culture's history

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
has related to, we'll call it,
elites who may have actually

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.520 align:middle line:84%
been handed information
down from something

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.140 align:middle line:90%
that we are a created species.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But in religions, the
creation of humans

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:90%
is allocated to a godhead.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I view DNA as an
analog coding molecule.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we sequence
the DNA, we're

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle line:84%
converting that analog
code into digital code.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The 1's and 0's in
the computer are

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:21.090 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
the dots and dashes

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:84%
that Schrodinger indicated
might be the original code.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've called this
process digitizing biology.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>> If Craig Venter and
his institute are correct,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:37.230 align:middle line:84%
does this mean our code is part
of a larger database or system?

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:10%
Is the tree of life
the representation

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:10%
of the database we live in or
an invitation to free ourselves

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.356 align:middle line:10%
from the code?

00:23:46.356 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:10%
>> The tree of life has
also been, sometimes,

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:10%
interpreted to maybe mean
certain drugs that give you

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.690 align:middle line:10%
insight.

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:10%
For example, we know
that certain drugs

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:10%
were used to gain psychedelic
experiences to try to gain

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:10%
insight into other realms.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is a very commonly
talked about drug today,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and that the tree of
life may have actually

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:84%
been the source of one
of these drugs that,

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:23.101 align:middle line:84%
then, gives this insight during
life into these other realms.

00:24:23.101 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Interestingly, in ancient
Egypt, the tree of life,

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:10%
which is found in many
scenes-- for example,

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:10%
there's a fabulous scene on
one of the walls of the temple

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:10%
of Karnak at Luxor
in Upper Egypt,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:10%
which shows the god
Thoth, the god of wisdom,

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:10%
the inventor of writing.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
He's the Egyptian counterpart
of Enki, as a matter of fact.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:84%
The god Thoth is
beside the tree.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:10%
And he's writing a
name on a little object

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.400 align:middle line:10%
that's hanging from the tree.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.252 align:middle line:84%
And after the other side,
you see the pharaoh Seti I,

00:25:01.252 --> 00:25:04.420 align:middle line:90%
who reigned about 1,400 BC.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And what Thoth is doing
is he's writing the name

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.680 align:middle line:90%
of Seti I on the tree of life.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.350 align:middle line:84%
What he's saying is you have
been justified in the judgment.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.735 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have earned the
life of millions of years.

00:25:16.735 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.290 align:middle line:84%
This becomes all
the more interesting

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:29.990 align:middle line:84%
when we look botanically at the
ancient Egyptian tree of life.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:10%
It happens that a very good
friend of mine Dennis McKenna,

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:10%
who is the brother of the late
great Terence McKenna, Dennis

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:10%
is an ethnopharmacologist.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.762 align:middle line:90%
He knows his trees.

00:25:40.762 --> 00:25:42.970 align:middle line:84%
He's very experienced and
knowledgeable in this area.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.303 align:middle line:90%
And he's worked on this subject.

00:25:44.303 --> 00:25:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's identified the
ancient Egyptian tree of life

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
as Acacia nilotica,
which, it so happens,

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.430 align:middle line:84%
is a tree the bark
of which contains

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.190 align:middle line:84%
large quantities of the most
powerful hallucinogen known

00:25:57.190 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to humanity
dimethyltryptamine, DMT,

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:84%
which, interestingly, is a
natural brain hormone as well.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:90%
We all produce DMT in the body.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.773 align:middle line:84%
A lot of research has
gone on into this.

00:26:09.773 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:90%
What's it doing there?

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:84%
It's present normally in
subpsychedelic quantities.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.350 align:middle line:84%
But why is it generated
in the human body at all?

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.490 align:middle line:90%
And where is it generated?

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's more
and more of a focus

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:84%
on the pineal gland,
the third eye,

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.630 align:middle line:90%
as a place where DMT manifests.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating that out
of the realm of plants,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:84%
with the molecule DMT involved,
the very molecule that

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.690 align:middle line:84%
is associated with the
ancient Egyptian tree of life,

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
we have these
teachings of how we

are to function in this
universe of duality

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and how we can be nurturing
and positive presences

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
in that universe rather
than negative ones,

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
how, in fact, we can detach
ourselves from the demiurge

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.576 align:middle line:84%
and approach the realm of
spirit much more directly.

00:26:55.576 --> 00:26:59.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the tree of life hold
a fruit of which we could see

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.800 align:middle line:90%

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Could these ancient
representations

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:84%
give us the tools
we need to break

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:90%
our third-dimensional prison?

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Some experts, like Jack Cary,
believe the ancient humans

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
tapped into a tool that
defied the ancient gods.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine a species that has
developed a language that is

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.130 align:middle line:84%
so potent that it literally uses
the laws of harmonic resonance

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:34.018 align:middle line:84%
in order to create instantaneous
change in your surroundings.
