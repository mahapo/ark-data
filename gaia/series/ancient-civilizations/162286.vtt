>> In 1997, Holley Moyes, an
archeologist at the University

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:10%
of California, led an expedition
to survey a large cave system

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:10%
in Belize, known as
Actun Tunichil Muknal.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
As they followed a bizarre
complex of chambers

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:84%
three miles into the Earth,
they discovered thousands

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
of offerings to ancient gods,
including the skeletal remains

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.800 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of human
sacrifices, and tools,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and ceramics made from the
semi-precious stone obsidian.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
What made this find
even more unusual

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
was that as Holley and her
team followed the trail

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper into the cave,
it appeared to have no end.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%

ultimately lead to?

Descriptions of the
caves in the "Popol Vuh,"

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
an ancient Maya
creation myth, has

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.870 align:middle line:84%
led many to believe these
archeologists had uncovered

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
an opening to the
ancient underworld, known

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.590 align:middle line:84%
as Xibalba, a much feared
threshold to the afterlife.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The Maya have an interesting
and related legend about

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:10%
an underworld called Xibalba.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:10%
Xibalba is basically
their version of hell.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And these lords of the
underworld in the Mayan story

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
cycle are basically
reptilian-headed humanoids.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:84%
You have one guy who's
got a crocodile head.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Another has got an iguana head.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Chaac, the rain goddess, has a
bird head, which is, you know,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:90%
somewhat reptilian.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme,
again, that we find

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:90%
throughout underworld lore.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Stories about beings that
rule these nether regions

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
are often reptilian,
yet humanoid.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Reptilian, yet humanoid is
not a new myth in the ancient

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
But are these Mayan
myths of an underground

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.870 align:middle line:84%
simply folklore or could there
be some scientific evidence

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.838 align:middle line:84%
that habitable places below
the Earth could exist?

00:02:45.838 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The hollow Earth theory has
been around for several years.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that has now begun

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:90%
to fascinate people again.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, the original theory
goes back maybe 500 years.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And various, very well-known
historical figures

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:90%
have talked about this.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:10%
Sir Isaac Newton was a
proponent for the hollow Earth.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.583 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is not
solid by a long shot.

00:03:07.583 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's always a lot
of movement motion going on

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:90%
down deep inside the Earth.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that there could be
large spaces inside the crust

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, even down
as far as the crust mantle

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
boundary that might be
conducive to habitation

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:90%
is not that impossible.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a lot of scientists
today, planetary scientists,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:10%
credible planetary scientists,
that will tell you that when

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:10%
a planet evolves, when
it comes into being,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:10%
it has to do so in such a way
that the center is hollow.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they dropped a bomb
on the moon not too long ago.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And the geologist,
NASA geologist

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.163 align:middle line:84%
wanted to record the
vibrations coming out

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of it so they could
tell something

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.230 align:middle line:90%
about the inner structure.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And it rang for eight hours
like a bell, like an empty bell.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:10%
And that kind of
gives you a glimpse.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, whether or not
the Earth itself

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:10%
is completely hollowed
out inside, or whether

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:10%
or not they are just
vast inner caverns that

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:10%
might be the size of whole
continents, I'm not sure.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:10%
But what I can tell you is that
in ancient civilization, all

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.030 align:middle line:10%
over the globe, they have
these hollow Earth stories.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In my research, I have
discovered maps that show a lot

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
of these deep underground
bases are also known as domes.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
These bases are
in locations where

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
there appear to have been other
openings deep under the Earth.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:10%
And how do I know this?

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, anybody can figure it
out because we have access

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to the ground
penetrating radar data.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:10%
This data shows specific
types of caverns and openings

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.983 align:middle line:10%
deep, deep beneath the
Earth, sometimes a mile deep.

00:04:49.983 --> 00:04:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And what it appears,
when you look

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.817 align:middle line:84%
at some of these overlaying
military tunnels,

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
it seems as if they
knew where they were at.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:10%
So they actually tunneled
to these actual locations,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:10%
these ancient
locations, and kind of

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:10%
made them into their path as
they created their own grid.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at the
creation stories of our past,

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:10%
as different as they
are from one another,

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:10%
there are common themes that
weave them all together.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the most obvious
of these common threads

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
is the theme of another world
beneath this one, a world--

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:84%
subterranean world-- from
which our ancestors emerged.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:84%
The Mayan calendar, for example,
it's a circular calendar.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And it shows four boxes with
unique lists representing

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:90%
the four worlds of the past.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya say there have
been four previous worlds.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:90%
We live in the fifth world.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
That it is represented by
the circle and the image

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.000 align:middle line:84%
that is staring right
at us from that circle.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Each of those four previous
worlds was destroyed.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:90%
One was destroyed by wind.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:90%
One was destroyed by fire.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.780 align:middle line:90%
One was destroyed by ice.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And when the ice
melted, a great flood

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:90%
destroyed the fourth world.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And that flood story is
one of the common themes

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:84%
that we find throughout
these indigenous traditions.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
is that just mythology

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
or are there any
physical links that

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.860 align:middle line:84%
can help us relate to
these in the real world?

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe the links in
the physical world are

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to our genetic existence and
how humans were able to survive

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.120 align:middle line:90%
cataclysm after cataclysm.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The old species tend to
transcend into something else

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:90%
sooner or later.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:10%
This is the process of evolution
and natural selection, which

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:10%
some people find very annoying.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:10%
But I see no mileage in saying
evolution doesn't happen.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
You need species
to have the ability

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:90%
to bounce back from assaults.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, for example, if you
have a giant asteroid or comet

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
hit the Earth and
make life on Earth

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.742 align:middle line:84%
extremely fragile
and tenuous, you

00:07:09.742 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
need to be able to
bounce back from that.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.617 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you need
to be able to duck and dive

00:07:13.617 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and evolve to adapt
to the new situations

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and keep the project
of life going.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:84%
The whole process of evolution
is a process of unfolding.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Could we become very different
from what we are now?

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Yes, given enough time,
given enough new situations

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:90%
to adapt to and develop with.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these new situations
have included taking refuge

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.610 align:middle line:90%
within the inner Earth?

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:10%
>> We have the biblical texts
about this notion of giants

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.470 align:middle line:10%
in the old days.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, after
the great floods

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.665 align:middle line:84%
and the great cataclysmic events
that may have sunk Atlantis,

00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
we can only speculate
to say that there

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
could be a breakaway
civilization that

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
went underground at the
end of the last cataclysm.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:10%
And these beings-- some
of whom could be giants,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:10%
others could look just like us
or some similar human to us--

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:10%
could be living
inside the Earth.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You get the Mayans
who kind of disappeared.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Like there's speculation
they may have ascended.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:10%
They maybe have gone to
a deeper plane existence

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:10%
that we originally came out of.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And same with the Tuatha
De Danann in Ireland, like,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:84%
they're said to be gods, or
fairies, or ancestral spirits,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.250 align:middle line:90%
but they were originally people.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.797 align:middle line:10%
I also see, like,
a lot of legends

00:08:32.797 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:10%
where people coming out of the
sea and coming out of the Earth

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:10%
may explain--

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.770 align:middle line:10%
may tie into the
Atlantis myth where

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:10%
we've come from deeper plans of
ontology, because a lot of time

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:10%
the underworld does represent
a deeper plane of existence.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Anton Park's research
indicates that the underworld

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.685 align:middle line:90%
can also be linked to creation.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:10%
the abyss is always linked
to the process of creation.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:10%
So we find this recurrent
theme of the abyss.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And through the research
that I have done,

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
I found out that Enki is
the master of the abyss,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
of the great deep,
which also in some ways

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:90%
corresponds to the underworld.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> If you go back to the
Mesopotamian creation stories,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
they talked about gods
from the sky, basically,

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.580 align:middle line:84%
bioengineering a form of
humanity that was already here,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:90%
creating a more modern form.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:10%
But they don't necessarily
say that the engineering

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:10%
was done in the sky.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, Enki was also the
god of the underwater realms.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:10%
So there was a possibility
that maybe there

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:10%
was some realm
underwater or underground

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:10%
where some of this activity
was being conducted.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
this possibility,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:84%
at least within the lore,
you don't necessarily

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:84%
exclude sky born gods from
gods that lived underground

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
because people had both ideas
that the gods had realms

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:84%
underground, underwater,
and in the sky.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And they interacted
with all of them.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Indeed, the further
back you go in history,

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
the more you are
faced with giants,

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:84%
just like prehistoric animals
on Earth, for example,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:90%
the dinosaurs.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:10%
Roughly, I would say that
if Enki is about six feet

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:10%
five inches, closer to human.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Anu and the other Sumerian
gods and goddesses, by the way

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:10%
they were portrayed, I
would say are about 11 feet

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:10%
5 inches, between 10 feet
and 11 feet five inches,

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:10%
maybe even up to 14 feet.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>> If some of the Sumerian
gods were suggested to be giant

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
in size, how would this relate
to myths of an underworld

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.140 align:middle line:90%
in South America?

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Sonja Grace uses her
alternative research

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to connect the dots on
the underground mythology

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:90%
in Mesopotamia.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> When I first spirit
traveled to the Ziggurat of Ur,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I was really amazed because
there was a very small

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:84%
structure, like a temple,
made out of stone.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And the Ant People,
who I call the Savrox,

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
were all over the land.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:90%
They were everywhere.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And one of them came up to me.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:10%
And these are ginormous ants.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:10%
These are not, you know,
little ants or people

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.720 align:middle line:10%
that look like-- they're ants.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And they came up to me and they
said, "We created this place

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we built
for the people of Atlantis

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
so that when Atlantis fell,
they had a place to go to.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:90%
We helped them to safety."

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "We
want to take you in

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:90%
and show you this place."

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So we went through
this little opening

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and we started going
down, and down,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:84%
and further, and further
into this long tunnel.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:90%
It went on forever.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, it opened out

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.110 align:middle line:84%
into this beautiful,
huge cavern.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:84%
There were all kinds
of rocks, and crystals,

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and stones in the walls.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:90%
There was a lake.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And it went on into
further caverns.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:90%
It was enormous.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "This
is where we led

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%
the people who did survive
and got out of Atlantis

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:90%
before it fell."

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And at the top of the
cave were these roots

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
from a big tree that
was coming down.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And they said that when
the people were there,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:84%
they referred to
this place as Eden.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
It was the place
that they had to--

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.540 align:middle line:84%
that was their refuge,
that saved them.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So they referred to
it and called it Eden.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And when the world
came back and life

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
was happening on
the surface again,

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:84%
in the roots of the tree
that were coming down

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:84%
from the top of the
cave, they could

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.130 align:middle line:84%
see greenery coming
out and growing.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So they knew it was OK to
come back up to the surface.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And when they came back up,
they referred to this tree

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:90%
as the Tree of Life.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> If the underworld is not
only a place of creation,

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:84%
might it also have
been a place to hide?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
In the Hebrew
Bible, the nephilim

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
were the sons of gods mingling
with the daughters of Adam.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:84%
They were also known as
giants and considered

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to be the fallen ones.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Michael Mott's research
suggests that they might

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:90%
have retreated underground.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:44.622 align:middle line:84%
Are these the giants
described in ancient texts?

00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people will say that
these giants are pre-Adamites,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
which means they came
about before Adam and Eve.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Some say that they
are nephilim, which

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:10%
would mean they are part
human and part fallen angel.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme that does
find a reflection in some

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
of the Native American
lore, because the giants are

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:84%
described as having six fingers,
six toes, double rows of teeth.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Occasionally, they have horns.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.462 align:middle line:84%
And this ties right in with
the ancient description

00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
of the nephilim, for instance
from the Book of Enoch,

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:84%
and other sources, and even
from the Old Testament.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that
we see again and again.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.357 align:middle line:90%
They fled a cataclysm.

00:14:20.357 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:90%
They fled something.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.570 align:middle line:90%
They fear.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So they go beneath
the Earth and they

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
claim that they live much
longer by living there.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.202 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty of water.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.660 align:middle line:84%
There are strange
areas where there

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a lot
of high pressure

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.995 align:middle line:84%
which blow out a lot
of breathable air.

00:14:33.995 --> 00:14:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But that's not to
say that you wouldn't

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
have to have a really
advanced level of,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.720 align:middle line:84%
not just civilization,
but technology in order

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.180 align:middle line:84%
to carve out a space inside
the crust of the planet

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
and to make a sustainable
environment there.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that I can give
an answer to this question.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that the survivors,
the ones that could still

00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:84%
be alive in our solar system,
live underground on Earth.

the Earth, into inner Earth.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
There may be a honeycomb of
caverns inside the Earth.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And there may be
groups living inside,

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
groups that are
non-terrestrial, groups

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.622 align:middle line:84%
that left the surface of the
Earth many, many millennia ago

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:90%
and just never came back out.

Historians have been
debating this for centuries.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the answer
to this question

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
lies deep in the Amazon jungle,
2,500 miles south of Belize.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:84%
An indigenous tribe,
known as the Macushi,

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:84%
have lived here with little
contact from the outside world

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:90%
until the mid 18th century.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet, their
mythology is almost

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
identical to beings who protect
the hollow Earth described

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:90%
by the Mayans.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:10%
>> You have that South
American tradition,

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:10%
which is very interesting, of
the tribe that said that they

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:10%
were guarding the entrance
to the inner Earth.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said it would take
maybe a couple of weeks

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to finally get down
far enough where they

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:90%
would meet the inhabitants.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And they were just these
gigantic people, anywhere

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.110 align:middle line:90%
between 10 and 11.5 feet tall.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So of course, the
common idea is that, oh,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.528 align:middle line:84%
this is just a bunch of
mythology by primitive people.

00:16:21.528 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is they talked

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:84%
about how when they
got far enough down,

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:84%
one of the things they saw
was, basically, molten rock.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
modern science tells us

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.240 align:middle line:84%
you should find
underneath the Earth.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And how would a primitive
people know that?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
There are also
areas where there's

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:84%
all this lush plants, and food,
and the people living down

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.120 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Can we take that seriously?

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:84%
We're left with this
very interesting myth

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that has some few
intriguing elements to it.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.830 align:middle line:84%
It's worth a look if
we can get down there.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The Macushi
Indians of Guyana,

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and also of the
northern Amazon basin,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.800 align:middle line:84%
have a very interesting
legend concerning an entrance

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:90%
to the inner Earth.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:10%
And according to their
legend, there is an entrance

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.170 align:middle line:10%
to the underworld there.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
they were in charge

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
of security over the
entrance to this location.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And according to
their legend, they

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.349 align:middle line:84%
could descend into this
world and come into contact

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
with the very tall men, who
were basically giants, 15 feet

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:90%
tall, 12 feet tall.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And they had been
given this task

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:84%
of guarding this location,
and the entrance,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and not letting
anyone else enter.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Traveling for 15 days down
into this cavern until they,

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
literally, put down their
torches because there's these

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
inner balls of light that will
light you the rest of the way

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:84%
on steps that are
33 inches long.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, making it into
caverns where food was growing,

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:84%
lit by four large, sun-like
disks that they couldn't even

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:90%
stare at, they were so bright.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And they described
the food as being

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:84%
apples the size of
a human head, grapes

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:84%
the size of a human fist,
interacting with giant beings

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.810 align:middle line:84%
that they described as being
three to four meters in height

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
who would catch giant fish
for them and give it to him

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:90%
as a gift.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.710 align:middle line:84%
That kind of detail
coming from a culture

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:84%
who didn't have any
access to libraries.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:10%
They don't have any access
to television, satellite,

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:10%
internet.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:10%
How is it that they
come across, or begin

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:10%
to tell stories, that
are being duplicated

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:10%
in all these other cultures?

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
There has to be
some truth to it.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether it's completely
hollow inside or whether or not

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
these vast caverns
are just there,

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:90%
I believe that they're there.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
believe that they're

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:84%
inhabited by what
we would describe

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:84%
as being an alien species, an
ultraterrestrial species rather

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
than an extraterrestrial
species.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these strange species
be linked to the Sumerian gods?

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Many of these stories
about a lost civilization

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:84%
under the Earth from indigenous
cultures around the world

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:90%
have strong similarities.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that
these giant creatures

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:10%
were the sages described
in ancient Sumerian texts

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:10%
and others?

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And did these beings bring back
humanity after a cataclysm?

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.960 align:middle line:10%
>> In Sumerian tradition, and
in the surviving texts that have

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:10%
been passed down to us, there
is a very strong and intriguing

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:10%
reference to what it called
the seven antediluvian sages.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.700 align:middle line:10%
Go over to India and we
have the seven rishis.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So this number keeps
on cropping up.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We can go further
away to Easter Island

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and then we discover
an ancient tradition

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that civilization was first
brought to Easter Island

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:90%
by seven initiated men.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, how are we to
take all of this?

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.313 align:middle line:84%
How can we put it into
some kind of context?

00:20:00.313 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:84%
For me, what I think
we're looking at

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
is more evidence that there
was a high civilization

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that we have lost
track of, that we truly

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:84%
are a species with amnesia, and
that we have forgotten a very

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:90%
important part of our story.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And fragments of that story
crop up all around the world.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.680 align:middle line:84%
What I think we're looking
at is an outreach program,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:84%
an outreach program reaching out
to the hunter-gatherers in what

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:84%
we would call the
upper paleolithic,

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to
teach certain of them

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:84%
selected skills, giving them
the gifts of civilization.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:10%
But to find this theme
again, and again, and again--

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:10%
the seven sages,
the seven wise men,

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.610 align:middle line:10%
teaching the gifts
of civilization--

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:10%
I would say we are looking
at symbolic allusions

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:10%
towards the outreach
of a lost civilization.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But who are these beings
we have lost touch with?

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> If we look back throughout
all the historical cycles,

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.250 align:middle line:84%
we find this interaction with
supposed reptilian humanoids.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:10%
And that goes as far as even
the mythic cycles of Europe.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:10%
And the whole concept of like,
for instance, frog princesses

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.080 align:middle line:10%
and all these other
strange things

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:10%
that we find coming down to us
in lore about these people who

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:10%
aren't quite human or they
can pass as humans sometimes,

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:10%
but they have a reptilian
aspect, the stories about them

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:10%
and their interactions
with people.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:84%
It's often seen that--
like, for instance,

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:90%
in the Mayan underworld--

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that even though these brothers
kill some of these beings,

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
the Mayan royalty
traces their lineage

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:90%
to some of these same beings.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.377 align:middle line:84%
And this is a theme we'll see,
you know, around the world,

00:21:40.377 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:90%
whether it's China, Japan.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Wherever it is, you
have an elite group

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that believes that they are
descended from these mostly

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
unseen beings who
live under the Earth.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.320 align:middle line:84%
The Annunaki in
the Sumerian texts

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:84%
are described as being
reptilian, to some extent,

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:84%
or have bird-like heads,
reptile-like heads.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Even in contemporary
accounts in ufology,

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.220 align:middle line:84%
people talk about the reptoids
and these humanoid beings

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:90%
with reptilian heads.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And this theme, again, is
associated with the underworld

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and with these unseen
manipulators of the human race.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
In the legend of
Central Asia, there

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:84%
are stories about
subterranean civilizations.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:84%
One of these is called
Agartha or Agharti.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:90%
The other one is called Potala.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.770 align:middle line:10%
And Potala is often
associated with the Naga,

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:10%
who are reptilian humanoids.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> As described in
"The Mahabharata,"

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
the Nagas are considered to
be a subterranean, half-human,

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:90%
half-serpent race.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:10%
At some point in
the ancient text,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:10%
they are important players in
many of the events in the epic

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:10%
and, frequently, even
on the side of good,

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.830 align:middle line:10%
given the nature
of their character.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:10%
They dwell in the
city Potala, which

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:10%
is said in the Vishnu Purana
to have seven realms, which are

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:10%
located one above the other.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Potala is a paradise.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And the Naga that live
there are described

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.570 align:middle line:84%
as a very advanced race or
species with a highly developed

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.190 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
According to the
legend, they wage war

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:90%
on the kingdom of Agartha.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The Agarthans are supposedly
enlightened human beings.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And they have a ruler over them
called the King of the World.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:10%
He has a capital called
Shambhala which is in Agartha.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And from this area,
supposedly, he

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:24.540 align:middle line:84%
influences events on
the surface world.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
They also influence
human civilization.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.760 align:middle line:84%
They either interfere with our
civilization to slow it down

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.700 align:middle line:84%
or they give us little
things to help advance it,

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:90%
when it suits their purposes.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
We get the idea,
we get the story,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that there is more
than one group

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and that they have
various agenda that

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.320 align:middle line:90%
conflict with each other.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Are these underground
beings really manipulating us?

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:10%
And if so, how?

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:10%
Graham Seer believes
the underworld

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:10%
is a world that reaches out
to us when we least expect it.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The entrances to the
inner Earth describe portals

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.090 align:middle line:90%
into the underworld.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And the underworld
is actually a plane

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.620 align:middle line:90%
between spirit and nature.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the area of
reality where spirit

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:84%
becomes nature and nature
turns back into spirit.

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's an intermediary sort of
paradoxical apparitional realm,

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:84%
which is closer to spirit
than nature is, because it's

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:90%
where nature comes out of.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
It's where the spirits
initially start

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:84%
to embody before they
finally densify and kind of

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.813 align:middle line:90%
fall into this frequency range.

00:24:33.813 --> 00:24:35.730 align:middle line:84%
You can look at it as
the Christian purgatory,

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
or the Celtic Otherworld,
or the Egyptian Duat,

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.070 align:middle line:90%
or the Kabbalistic Yetzirah.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:84%
These are all different
names that refer

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:44.910 align:middle line:90%
to this intermediary plane.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:49.015 align:middle line:84%
And it's also where
prophetic imagination occurs

00:24:49.015 --> 00:24:49.890 align:middle line:90%
and all these things.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.280 align:middle line:90%
It's where revelation occurs.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.670 align:middle line:90%
>> We are drawn to caves.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.000 align:middle line:10%
Joseph Campbell said that all of
the world's religions probably

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:10%
started in some cave in Siberia,
where the first shamans went

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:10%
and had a dream or a vision,
told a story and the story

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.503 align:middle line:10%
was retold and retold.

00:25:09.503 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:10%
Interesting that it might
have been in a cave.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, the shamans in
Siberia lived in caves,

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:90%
but caves reach down and down.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Spelunkers go and
explore the depths

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:90%
of unseen parts of the planet.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:84%
This planet, the planet we
have known and studied so well,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
there are all these
unseen places.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:90%
There is more to be known.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Even as our technology
advances, we

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:84%
have to be humbled by how much
close at hand we do not know.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.670 align:middle line:84%
The ancients, the people, the
primal people that lived close

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:84%
to the Earth saw the gods and
spirits, the sacred energies,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:90%
as down in those places.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Whether we go down to explore
physically-- personally,

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
I'll let somebody else
do the exploring--

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:84%
but I want to explore
mentally and spiritually.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to imagine
what is below us,

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:90%
what the Earth has to teach us.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
It is a living thing and
our lives are tied to it.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to be adherents
of the ancient nature religions

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:90%
to know this is important stuff.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:90%
But the stories can help us.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.280 align:middle line:84%
That perhaps there is
some kind of personality

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a relationship
with, some god, some goddess--

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:84%
more likely, since the Earth
is maternal, it feeds us--

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be respectful
of and to seek a deeper

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.560 align:middle line:90%
relationship with.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Could there really be beings
living inside of the Earth

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:90%
manipulating humans?

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible we, at one
time, were created or recreated

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:90%
beneath the surface?

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Or is the meaning
behind the legends

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.560 align:middle line:84%
a metaphor for the greatest
secrets the Earth keeps

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:90%
on our human existence?

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean we
are all searching

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:90%
for our own personal Xibalba?

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins
suggests something

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:84%
from beyond this planet might be
trying to get in touch with us

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:90%
on the surface.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:10%
He points to a discovery by
astronomers at the Green Bank

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:10%
Telescope that suggested
light signals were emanating

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:10%
from a star in the
Cygnus constellation

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:10%
1,200 light years away.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:16.710 align:middle line:84%
This fluctuating star
was cataloged KIC 8462852

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.810 align:middle line:90%
and named Tabby's Star.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what I have determined,
related to this star,

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:29.170 align:middle line:84%
is that there are certain cycles
associated with the Kepler

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:30.040 align:middle line:90%
data.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.350 align:middle line:90%
They are all interlinked.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And they all reflect
certain key numbers.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And those key numbers are the
numbers 11, 121, and 1331.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Now all of them are
multiples of 11.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next is there something
trying to help us figure out

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:90%
this code to humanity?

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And could they be using our own
ancient sites on this planet?

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.940 align:middle line:90%
