00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:38.455 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; In 1961, approximately
60 miles west of Marrakesh,

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.501 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
Morocco, a barite mining
operation at the Jebel Irhoud

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:46.046 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
massif turned up a
fossil human skull.

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:49.216 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
The unusual skull was
classified as homo sapiens

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:54.388 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
and eventually was dated to
roughly 160,000 years ago,

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.348 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
but to most scientists,
this was still

00:00:56.348 --> 00:00:59.142 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
a mystery, as the
Jebel Irhoud fossils

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:02.646 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
and skull looked much more
primitive than even the older

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.606 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:12%
sapiens.

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:07.818 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
This stayed a
mystery until 2017,

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:10.404 align:center line:0 position:50% size:35%
when paleoanthropologist
Jean-Jacques Hublin

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:12.906 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
and his team from the
Max Planck Institute

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:17.077 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
opened the cave where it
was found for investigation.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:21.665 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
They were surprised to find even
more skulls, as well as tools.

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.167 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
These tools, according
to their research,

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:29.131 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
dated to around
300,000 years ago.

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:33.176 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
If the fossils do in fact
represent homo sapiens,

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.221 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
as the team argues,
the finds push back

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.934 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
the origin of our species
by more than 100,000 years

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.729 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
and challenge certain ideals.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.231 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
But the findings
also shed some light

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:49.609 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
on human brain development
by these early humans

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.697 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
and why they might look
a little different.

00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:58.410 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
&gt;&gt; It is within the
variability of living humans.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.538 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
The main differences
relate to the shape.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.124 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
So, it's a brain which
is much less globular.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.793 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
It's more elongated.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.211 align:center line:0 position:50% size:21%
There are parts
of the brain that

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:12.299 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
is less developed than what
they are in today's people--

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.634 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
for example, the
cerebellum, which

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:18.930 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
is a part of the brain which
is underneath in the back.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.850 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; The cerebellum accounts
for 10% of the organ's total

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.229 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
volume, but contains more
than 50% of its neurons.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.482 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
It's been assumed that its
functions were strictly

00:02:28.482 --> 00:02:31.902 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
to coordinate activities
like standing and breathing,

00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:36.365 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
but in 2017, neuroscientists
from Stanford University

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:40.118 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
discovered that it plays a
role in reward response, one

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:44.081 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
of the main drives that motivate
and shape human behavior.

00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:48.919 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
How could this part of the brain
actually help frame humanity?

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.629 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
The team at the Max
Planck Institute

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.631 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
finds this discovery
interesting,

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.509 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
as they believe this
early human skull shows

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.678 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
that the brain developed certain
areas of conscious awareness

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:02.057 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
over time and not all at once.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.684 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
What could have prompted
a change in human behavior

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.979 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
and connectedness over
the course of history?

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:12.109 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
And more importantly, what kind
of understanding of our reality

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.446 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
helped us form our idea of
our place in the universe?

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.908 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
Several thousand miles south
of the Jebel Irhoud cave

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.828 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
resides a tribe with some
interesting information

00:03:22.828 --> 00:03:25.247 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
on their development.

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:29.626 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:19%
[DRUMMING]

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.967 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
&gt;&gt; The Dogon tribe of West
Africa were discovered in 1935

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:38.969 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
by two French anthropologists.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:42.305 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
Griaule and Dieterlen
were their names.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:46.101 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
These two anthropologists
eventually

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.146 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
gained the respect
of the Dogon shaman

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:53.817 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
and were allowed to hear
their sacred knowledge.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.069 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
What amazed these
anthropologists

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.489 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
was that the Dogon tribe
possessed knowledge

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.535 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
of the Sirius star system that
no ancient people should ever

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:04.953 align:center line:0 position:50% size:23%
have possessed.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:10.375 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
The Dogon tribe told them
that not only was there

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.919 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
a relationship between
Sirius and our star,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.964 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
but they claim that a
group of what could only

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:20.760 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
be described as alien creatures
called the Nommos descended

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.514 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
down to Earth and that
this group of beings

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:28.143 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
imparted to them the knowledge
that they then possessed

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:30.395 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
about the Sirius star system.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.439 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
What they couldn't
understand was

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.733 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
how it was they had
knowledge of a Sirius

00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.319 align:center line:0 position:50% size:40%
B, which is a white dwarf star.

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.156 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
It's the smallest form of
visible star that we know of,

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:44.576 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
and we can barely see it
with modern day telescopes.

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:47.954 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
And yet they knew its
absolute existence,

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:52.751 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
and they called it Po Tolo,
which is a tiny seed found

00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:54.294 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:20%
in West Africa.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.506 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
And they said it's a tiny star,
but it's the heaviest thing

00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:58.298 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:17%
that there is.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.384 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
Well, they were
alluding to the fact

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:04.137 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
that white dwarf stars
have some of the highest

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:08.558 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
density of any stellar
bodies that we know of.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:11.228 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
And that's not something
an ancient people should

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:13.230 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
have known anything about.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.528 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
They even spoke of a Sirius
C, yet another stellar body

00:05:19.528 --> 00:05:21.988 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
in the Sirius star
system, something

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:28.620 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
which wasn't proven to be true
until 1995, a full 60 years

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.081 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
after the discovery
of this tribe.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.251 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
&gt;&gt; Is it possible the Dogon
tribe were taught certain

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:37.754 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
understandings of the universe
by beings from Sirius?

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:41.341 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
If so, who were these strange
beings called the Nommos,

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.886 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
and how did they
influence a species?

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:47.847 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
&gt;&gt; The most interesting thing
that I found about the Dogon

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:51.476 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
tribe is that they
highly revere twins.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.728 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
They believe that
each man and woman

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.231 align:center line:0 position:50% size:35%
is born with both genders.

00:05:56.231 --> 00:06:01.444 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
They have an amazing
understanding of duality.

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.406 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; The creation story of the
Dogon is absolutely wonderful.

00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:07.200 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
They basically found
that, in the beginning,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.037 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
there was this almighty
entity called Amma

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:14.040 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
suspiciously close to our moon.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.668 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
He sets up and
creates the twins.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.878 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
The first set of twins
that came out of the earth

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.922 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
came out a little
bit early, so they

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.882 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
were considered to be
imperfect, and that came

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.510 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
to symbolize the human race.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.928 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
But there's another
group of twins

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:29.139 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
that came out that were
absolutely perfect,

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.058 align:center line:0 position:50% size:46%
and they were called the
Nommo, and the Nommo basically

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:35.103 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
were these sort of
amphibious water creatures,

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:37.647 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
and because they were so
perfect that when they finally

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.442 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
died they went to a place
called paradise, which

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:43.153 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
the Dogon claimed to
be somewhere in Sirius,

00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:44.613 align:center line:0 position:50% size:20%
the star Sirius.

00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:47.907 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
After the Nommos have gone
to paradise and Sirius,

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.868 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
they said, we're going
to go back to the Earth.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:53.079 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
And when the Nommos landed,
they said that they basically

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:57.250 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
gave the civilizing arts to
humanity, which, back then was

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.461 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
living a very barbaric life.

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:01.296 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
And what's astonishing
about this story,

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.715 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
apart from the fact the story
is astonishing in itself

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:07.260 align:center line:0 position:50% size:40%
as a depiction of how creation
began in their point of view,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.763 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
is the fact that it mirrors
so many other creation

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.931 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
myths throughout the
world, whether it's

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.975 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
in South America or Polynesia.

00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:17.187 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
There are very, very great
similarities between the Dogon

00:07:17.187 --> 00:07:19.356 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
and other cultures, as well.

00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:22.901 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
&gt;&gt; What's fascinating about
the linguistics surrounding

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:27.781 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
the Nommos is that in ancient
India you have the Nagas,

00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:32.535 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
who were a half-serpent
half-human looking deity.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.288 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
In Australia with the
aboriginal tribes,

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.374 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
they had the Nurumbungutias.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.959 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
Linguistically, these
names are all so close

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:44.297 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
together that they had to
have had a singular origin.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.174 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
&gt;&gt; What makes it
even more amazing,

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:50.261 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
when you look at
Neolithic cultures,

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:52.931 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
the idea that
there are evolving,

00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:57.811 align:center line:0 position:50% size:35%
standing up primates
coming in various models,

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:01.189 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
and they come up over two
million years from Lucy

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:06.820 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
in Africa, and you get to
Mesopotamia and the idea that

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.282 align:center line:0 position:50% size:23%
the tribes that
have no writing--

00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.785 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
they have no math.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:19.541 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
They have no ability to
build perfect pyramids,

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:23.086 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
and within a tiny,
short period of time,

00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:27.215 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
you have this entire
Sumerian culture

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:33.388 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
that is building mega
structures and language.

00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:37.767 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
When you come back through
the last couple of centuries,

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.979 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
what has been the mantra?

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:46.985 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
That homo sapiens came up out
of the jungle and out of mud,

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:51.906 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
and that 5,000 years ago,
they built the pyramids.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:57.829 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
They built these huge structures
that we relate to Sumeria.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:09:01.708 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
And probably in South
America at the same time,

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.251 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
structures were
being built there

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:07.005 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
because the same
builders in Mesopotamia

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:11.843 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
were building in Mexico,
Central America, South America.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:15.180 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
It was a global architecture.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:21.770 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
It was a global intelligence
that just comes in.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.648 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; If this is true, how is
the star Sirius connected with

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:29.235 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
a global intelligence that
transformed early humans

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:32.906 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
into creating civilizations and
motivating them to have certain

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:34.616 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:21%
belief systems?

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:37.577 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Could it be that Sirius
itself is the repository

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:42.248 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
of a specific type of wisdom
from where came creatures

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:45.627 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
of a certain humanoid nature,
which were kind of like us,

00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:47.837 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
but still very different?

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.965 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
Because they reside in every
single culture in the world,

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:54.677 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
and all of these people came to
the Earth after a barbaric time

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:57.347 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
to give us the stuff that
we know today-- mathematics,

00:09:57.347 --> 00:10:00.767 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
astronomy, how to create
temples with monolithic blocks

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.812 align:center line:0 position:50% size:40%
and things like that,
agriculture, animal husbandry.

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.898 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
They all go back to these people
whose source always ends up

00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:07.774 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:12%
in Sirius.

00:10:07.774 --> 00:10:09.567 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
So were they real?

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:13.613 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
Or was it a myth to explain a
specific point in the universe

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.366 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
where things really
originate from?

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.202 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
&gt;&gt; The Nommos were
representative of the order

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.453 align:center line:0 position:50% size:13%
on Earth.

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:24.582 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
These beings were amphibious
beings, fish-like creatures,

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:28.044 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
which were eerily,
eerily mysterious.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:31.089 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
Now, if we take a look at other
mythologies-- for example,

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.674 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
ancient Atlantis--

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:36.261 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
we will find that Atlantis
has similar beings described

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.470 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
there called the Telchines.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.681 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
The Telchines were
the beings who

00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.559 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
possessed incredible
knowledge in metallurgy.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.270 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
These beings were the
bringers of knowledge.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.106 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
If we take a look at ancient
Egypt or ancient Sumeria,

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:51.943 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
we will find that several
other beings existed

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:53.570 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
in those mythologies as well.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.533 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
So we will find the same beings
existing in their accounts,

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:01.327 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
but with different names.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.830 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
&gt;&gt; The star Sirius
is the brightest star

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:07.166 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
in the Earth's sky and is in
the constellation Canis Major,

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.793 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:19%
the great dog.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:12.130 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
Its coordinates are right
ascension 6 hours 45 minutes

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:19.345 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
9 seconds, declination minus
16 degrees 42 feet 58 inches.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:22.015 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
Could it be that the Dogon
tribe named themselves

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.475 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
after this connection
with the star system?

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:27.270 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
And where do we see the
coordinates of Sirius

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.314 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:20%
on our planet?

00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:32.692 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; In my personal research,
I believe that the knowledge

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:36.571 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
of the Nommos actually came
from their time in ancient Egypt

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:40.491 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
and being part of the
ancient Egyptian priesthood.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.286 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
The Dogon said that
they had actually came

00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.246 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
from ancient Egypt.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:47.790 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
Now, that's fascinating
because in ancient Egypt,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.585 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
what we find is
the fact that there

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:54.589 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
is a direct correlation between
the mass of the Great Pyramid

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.342 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
and the mass of the
pyramid of Kefron.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:12:01.471 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
That is an exact
mathematical mirroring

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.182 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
of the difference between
the mass of Sirius B

00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.225 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
and the mass of our star.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:09.187 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
That is the fraction 1.036.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:12.148 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
It's known as the
comma of Pythagoras,

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:17.987 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
and it is alluding to harmonic
mathematical theory, the idea

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:22.116 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
that one body can
vibrate in such a way

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:25.203 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
that it causes
change in another.

00:12:25.203 --> 00:12:28.373 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
That was what the ancient
mystery schools had

00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:31.000 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
as the heart of their secret.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.379 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; The Dogon probably are part
of that offshoot that were

00:12:34.379 --> 00:12:38.299 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
holding onto a very old
lineage of teachings who then,

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:42.261 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
by either war, cultural changes,
or just the mere fact that

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.138 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
the weather kept
changing all the time,

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:48.226 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
they migrated westwards
to where they are today.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.727 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:21%
But within their
social structure

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.145 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
and their spiritual
structure, you

00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:54.774 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
had this concept of a creative
god called Amun, or Amma,

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:56.526 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
and the two are basically
interchangeable,

00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.736 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
because when you look at the
ancient principle of what

00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:02.657 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
Amun stands for and Amma,
they're the same being.

00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.868 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; If this is true, what else
could these mystery schools

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:09.247 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
of ancient Egypt reveal about
the Sirius connection to human

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:11.457 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:19%
development?

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:14.377 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
&gt;&gt; This is where things
turn fascinating,

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:18.256 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
and it's my main
point of research--

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:21.759 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
is the fact that, as
I've spoken before,

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.595 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
the mathematics of
harmonic resonance

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:27.890 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
were built into these
ancient monuments.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.019 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
This was done by
the Anunnaki, who

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:34.105 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
were cast down on the
earth after their deceit

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:37.483 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
to Anu, because that
was the scenario left

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:41.029 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
to Enki and his 200 followers.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.947 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
And they set about
building the only thing

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:47.076 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:45%
that they could build, which
was these amazing ancient stone

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:50.913 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
structures that we couldn't
even build to this day.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.374 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
They built into the
actual mathematics

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.668 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
of these ancient
stone structures

00:13:55.668 --> 00:14:01.340 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
the very closely held secret
of all ancient mystery schools

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.259 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
and occult traditions.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:07.013 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
This secret-- the fact
that the human body itself,

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:10.641 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
through the seven chakra zones,
which also equate to the seven

00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:15.271 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
notes in a musical octave, can,
through harmonic resonance,

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:19.525 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
affect the reality
fabric around us--

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:23.780 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
and that's done through what
they call light wave harmonics.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.283 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
Chakras are called wheels
of light for a reason,

00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:32.288 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
and each one vibrates to a
different octave, if you will.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.457 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
That's the exact same
knowledge that they

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.752 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
built into these monuments,
knowing that eventually we

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.546 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
would be able to
discover that and use it

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:43.257 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
as the Promethean
keys of our escape.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:51.182 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
The star Sirius resonates
harmonically with our star.

00:14:51.182 --> 00:14:56.229 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
That means that-- imagine
you walk into a room,

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:59.357 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
and in the room, there's a
gentleman playing the violin,

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.109 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
and on the other
side of the room,

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:04.112 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
there's a piano
that nobody's at.

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:07.365 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
You can walk over to the piano
and look down at the strings,

00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:10.952 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
and each string will vibrate
to a note being played

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:13.454 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
on the violin across the room.

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:15.706 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
It's that mechanism that
we're talking about,

00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:20.002 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
and that relationship exists
between Sirius and our star,

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:23.589 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
meaning that a perturbation,
a change in one

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:27.927 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
will take place
instantaneously in the next.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:31.556 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
That may be the reason why
the Anunnaki, or the Nommos,

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:34.725 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
or the Nagas, or
Nurumbungutias came here.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:38.229 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
They were following
this harmonic highway

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:39.272 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
through the star system.

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:45.111 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
&gt;&gt; There's a really
interesting thing I came across

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.781 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
in my research, because as you
know, I research scientists,

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:52.493 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
and I research the
work of intuitives--

00:15:52.493 --> 00:15:53.536 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
the whole spectrum.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.705 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
I'm looking for consistency.

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:59.542 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
I'm looking for where there's
validation from both sides.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.003 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
I was given the same story--

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:05.006 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
that some of the great
beings who come and teach

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:07.717 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
throughout the cosmos to
lift consciousness anywhere--

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:08.593 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:18%
it's just a job.

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:09.969 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
That's what they do.

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.097 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
They're not to be worshiped
or heralded in any other way

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:15.850 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
any more than you or I,
but that's what they do.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.561 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
But there's a process
they have to go through.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.022 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
There are other
people who are those

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:26.235 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
who come as masters and as
teachers for planet Earth,

00:16:26.235 --> 00:16:29.488 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
and those people may be
considered to be on the path

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:30.948 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:15%
to the sun.

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:33.743 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
If you look at Sirius
as what is considered

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:36.162 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
the sun behind the sun--

00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:39.040 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
20 times brighter,
twice as large,

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.376 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
this incredibly brilliant star--

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:46.380 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
as the sun behind the sun,
it takes on other meanings.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:51.552 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
One of them is that Sirius
is also associated with Isis.

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:55.056 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
So if you start looking at the
genuine meaning of what Isis

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:58.517 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
is, you go beyond all of
these common identities

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:03.397 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
to something primal, almost
primordial or prima materia--

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:06.108 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
materia, material,
mater, mother.

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:08.027 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
You go back to the
mother energy, which

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:13.074 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
is the source of physical
creation of the entire universe

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:14.659 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:18%
or universes.

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:18.955 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
So if you take that look at
it and you look at Sirius

00:17:18.955 --> 00:17:23.167 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
as the sun behind the sun,
what gives birth to the sun?

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.835 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
The mother of the sun.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:26.629 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
So it would make
perfect sense that Isis

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:31.217 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
is associated with Sirius.

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.469 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
&gt;&gt; The fact that that
relationship exists at all

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:37.098 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
between two stellar bodies that
are 8.7 light years away is

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:40.851 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
an indication to us that that
same relationship exists over

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:45.147 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
the entire universe, and
because they were responsible

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:49.819 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
for developing our biology, they
knew that that same mechanism

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.363 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
existed within the human body--

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:54.198 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
that they literally
built within us

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:58.119 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
the ability to control our
own reality through it.

00:17:58.119 --> 00:18:00.705 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
This knowledge
became the knowledge

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.958 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
of all the ancient mystery
schools, the knowledge of how

00:18:03.958 --> 00:18:07.878 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
to actually attune yourself to
these frequencies in such a way

00:18:07.878 --> 00:18:12.758 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
that you can cause change
in conformity with will.

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:15.970 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
That's the great secret
of magic practices,

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.182 align:center line:0 position:50% size:35%
and what the Egyptian
priesthood wanted forever

00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:23.060 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
to try to preserve, and
have largely done so.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.396 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
The knowledge is still
alive and well in a lot

00:18:25.396 --> 00:18:29.108 align:center line:0 position:50% size:40%
of different occult
priesthoods around the world.

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:32.570 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
&gt;&gt; But why was this priesthood
only preserving this knowledge

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.155 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
for themselves?

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:38.242 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
In 1353 BC, a pharaoh
in the 18th dynasty

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:42.830 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:49%
named Akhenaten wanted to expose
these secrets to his people?

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.833 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
He wanted his people
to only worship Aten,

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.586 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
which was the disk of the sun.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:51.088 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
&gt;&gt; I think he was following
a very long tradition,

00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.716 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
a very long bloodline,
and because of that,

00:18:53.716 --> 00:18:56.469 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
he also followed a very
long spiritual tradition.

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.512 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
The priesthood had
gotten onto the fact

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:00.097 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
that they're onto
a good job here.

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:03.142 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
It's a job creation scheme
of dividing a central god

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:05.644 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
into many, many,
many, many gods, which

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.313 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
allows their people
to worship all kinds

00:19:07.313 --> 00:19:09.607 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
of interesting
things, but they have

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.317 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
to talk to a central priesthood.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.277 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
Now, that's a great
job creation scheme,

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:15.196 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
where you have someone
inserting itself

00:19:15.196 --> 00:19:17.656 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
into the middle of a
connection between you

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.367 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
and the spiritual godhead.

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:22.078 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
Akhenaten takes over, and
he says, you know what?

00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.121 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
I want to hurry, speed
things along a little bit.

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:28.167 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
Why don't we just begin to
remove the worship of all

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:29.877 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
of these myriads of gods?

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:33.089 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
Because people don't know what
they're worshipping anymore.

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:35.716 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
Let's concentrate
on one focal power

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:39.261 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
point, which is the Aten,
the center of all creation.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:42.223 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
And it's not because he forbade
people to worship other gods.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.974 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
He didn't do that.

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:46.602 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
What he did was is
saying, stop doing this.

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:48.646 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
I want you to focus on
the important thing,

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:51.232 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
the central issue, because
if you can understand

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.693 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
the central concept of
the Aten, from there,

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.362 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
you will empower
yourself to understand

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.406 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
the true nature of what
the other gods are doing.

00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:00.366 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
We're going back to
the drawing board here.

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:01.867 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
And it also means
we don't give them

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:05.287 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
power to become
intermediaries between us

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:07.957 align:center line:0 position:50% size:45%
and the creative source, because
you don't need an intermediary.

00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:09.125 align:center line:0 position:50% size:16%
Let's face it.

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.918 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
This is why he got into
a lot of deep water

00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:13.129 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
and why there's a lot
of public relations

00:20:13.129 --> 00:20:14.964 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
that were negatively
aimed at him

00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:18.134 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
and why eventually there
was a military coup that

00:20:18.134 --> 00:20:20.010 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
forced him out of power.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.096 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
He was trying to
create monotheism

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:25.224 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
for the sake of focusing
people's spirituality back

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:28.394 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
where it ought to be, not
what it had developed into,

00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:31.981 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
which essentially was
a corrupt priesthood.

00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:35.151 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
&gt;&gt; This wasn't the first
mention of Aten in Egypt.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:38.195 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
Thousands of years earlier
in the 12th dynasty,

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:41.907 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
the first known reference to
Aten the sun disk as a deity

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.285 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
is in the story of Sinuhe.

00:20:44.285 --> 00:20:46.871 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
This reference suggests
that the deceased king

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:50.124 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
is described as rising
as god to the heavens

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:53.878 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
and uniting with the sun
disk, the divine body merging

00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.713 align:center line:0 position:50% size:20%
with its maker.

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:58.716 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
Could Akhenaten have had
passed down knowledge

00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.719 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
from an older lineage?

00:21:01.719 --> 00:21:05.514 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
&gt;&gt; When I spirit traveled
to the 18th dynasty,

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:08.726 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
my guides took me to the temple
where Akhenaten and Nefertiti

00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:13.481 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
were, and we stood and listened
to a conversation that they

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:14.440 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:6%
had.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.442 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
They were quite misshapen.

00:21:16.442 --> 00:21:21.197 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
Their heads were so elongated,
and their bodies were not

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:24.366 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
of a normal human shape.

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:29.079 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
And they seemed to be intent
in their conversation about how

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:32.249 align:center line:0 position:50% size:23%
important it was
that they change

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:35.044 align:center line:0 position:50% size:23%
the beliefs of the
Egyptian people.

00:21:35.044 --> 00:21:37.546 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
Both Akhenaten
and Nefertiti come

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:44.803 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
from Sirius A. They are bringing
their understanding, their lore

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:48.724 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
to Egypt, basically
as star beings.

00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.643 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
And to make that a
bigger statement,

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:52.144 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
we're all star
beings, and we all

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:54.271 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
came in from different places.

00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.023 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
This is where they came in.

00:21:56.023 --> 00:22:00.361 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
They worshipped Aten,
which was Sirius, the sun,

00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:03.906 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
and they wanted to bring
that in, because for him,

00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:07.284 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
he could see, growing
up in this environment,

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:11.205 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
that the Egyptian gods
had much more power.

00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:14.458 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
I also was taken back
to the Great Pyramid,

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:17.586 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
and when my guides and
I entered the pyramid,

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:20.714 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
Anubis was standing
guard, and he

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.883 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
wasn't going to let us get by.

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:26.595 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
And my guide spoke with
him, and he stepped aside,

00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:30.015 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
and we went into the queen's
chamber, where Ra was

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.309 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
standing there waiting for us.

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:37.022 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
And he told me that this was
the connection, or the portal,

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:40.025 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
to Sirius and that it
is the queen's chamber

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:45.030 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
that was used for transport
to and from Sirius.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.200 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
Ra told me that
Anubis was actually

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.871 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
adopted by Osiris and
Isis, and the adoption

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:58.586 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
was because Anubis was not
from the same place all

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.046 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
the Egyptian gods came from.

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:03.048 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
They are all from Orion.

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:08.262 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:46%
Anubis came from the Southern
Cross, and when he was adopted,

00:23:08.262 --> 00:23:12.182 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
he took on the head
and the shape of a dog

00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:16.645 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
so that he would
emulate the dog star

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:22.568 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
and be a part of that group
of demi gods, and be accepted.

00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:27.948 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
He really wanted the acceptance
of Ra, and Osiris, and Isis.

00:23:27.948 --> 00:23:34.830 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:45%
So he became a part of the group
by adopting this dog-like head.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:39.835 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; I would argue in my research
that there was a connection

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:42.921 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
between these cultures
that stems back way,

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:46.175 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
way beyond what modern day
historians have been able

00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:51.221 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
to trace, and the reason for
that is not only the similarity

00:23:51.221 --> 00:23:54.850 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
between their pantheon of
gods, but the similarity

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.812 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
in the structures that they've
built and that it all goes back

00:23:58.812 --> 00:24:03.108 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:45%
to a much earlier time when
maybe the Mesoamericans came

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:05.694 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
from a completely different
part of the world.

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:08.656 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
What's fascinating
about Osiris, and Horus,

00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:12.785 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
and Quetzalcoatl is their
connection to the star Sirius.

00:24:12.785 --> 00:24:15.537 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
What you have with
Quetzalcoatl is

00:24:15.537 --> 00:24:19.458 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
a god that has a twin
brother with a dog head.

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.669 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
He becomes the
star Sirius, and he

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:24.254 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
guards the sun through
the underworld,

00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:28.967 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
much the same as Anubis was
the guardian of the underworld.

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:31.470 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
&gt;&gt; If Akhenaten knew this
deep-seated knowledge

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.515 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
and wanted his people to return
to the true understanding

00:24:34.515 --> 00:24:38.227 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
of their being, why did the
ancient Egyptians reject this

00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:39.603 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:13%
thinking?

00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:42.147 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
&gt;&gt; Suddenly, in the
blink of an eye,

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:44.066 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
humans started to
develop agriculture--

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:47.820 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
the animal husbandry, the
organization of crops,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.280 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
organizing themselves into
cultural groups where they

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.450 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
develop cities and
communal areas.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.285 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
That hadn't happened
before, and it

00:24:55.285 --> 00:25:00.165 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
happened in the blink of
an eye out of barbarism.

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:02.376 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
So obviously there had to
have been outside influence

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:05.254 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
of people who really
understood the civilizing

00:25:05.254 --> 00:25:07.798 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
qualities of nature
in order to bring that

00:25:07.798 --> 00:25:10.926 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
to people who had lost
touch with that concept.

00:25:10.926 --> 00:25:13.220 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
And Akhenaten really
goes back to that concept

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.639 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
of people who
literally stayed here

00:25:15.639 --> 00:25:17.307 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
for a considerable
amount of time,

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:21.478 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
interbred, and then
died out bit by bit.

00:25:21.478 --> 00:25:24.606 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
&gt;&gt; We know that Akhenaten and
his family are of a different

00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:25.983 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:20%
genetic breed.

00:25:25.983 --> 00:25:28.527 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
That was very evident
by their features.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.320 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
They looked nothing
like the people

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.781 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
that existed in that day.

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.367 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
Another thing we have
to remember is that,

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.119 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
when the Egyptians--
and particularly,

00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:39.079 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
the 18th dynasty--

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:42.791 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
were leaving remnants,
artifacts, pictographs,

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:47.713 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
hieroglyphics, there was nothing
that was left by accident.

00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:50.924 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
These were very
advance people in terms

00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:54.970 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
of the level of their mystery
school training and knowledge.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.432 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
They understood the
practice of magic.

00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:02.394 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
Akhenaten, to me, is one of
the most fascinating people

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:04.021 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:13%
in history.

00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:06.482 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
If you read his hymn
to the sun, you'll

00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:11.069 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
see that there was, again,
this great reverence for--

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.446 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
not the solar disk.

00:26:12.446 --> 00:26:15.908 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
That's just a simpleton's way
of looking at it-- a solar disk.

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:17.242 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:5%
No.

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:21.705 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
His honoring was of the
vast entity of the sun

00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:25.959 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
and the central sun, the
sun behind the sun as well.

00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.546 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
And this is the source of
all creation and knowledge

00:26:29.546 --> 00:26:31.173 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
in his understanding.

00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:33.717 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
When he talks in
simple terms in this--

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:36.595 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
the way in which the
sun affects our lives--

00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.263 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
our lives depend on it.

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:41.141 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
Our spiritual lives, our
physical lives depend on it.

00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:43.644 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
The growth of all
things on this planet

00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:48.023 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
can be taken back to the
direct presence of our sun

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:49.942 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
in our solar system.

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:53.320 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
Our solar system wouldn't
exist without our sun.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.948 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
So to try to draw the
people's attention back

00:26:55.948 --> 00:26:59.618 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
to one central
theme, which is back

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:04.122 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
to the sun and the central
sun as the emanation

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:07.584 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
point of knowledge,
wisdom, and life itself--

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:11.213 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
that is what Akhenaten
was attempting to do.

00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:15.884 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
Now sadly, this wasn't popular
among the priests of the day.

00:27:15.884 --> 00:27:18.345 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
There were hierarchies
that already existed--

00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:20.347 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
power players in place.

00:27:20.347 --> 00:27:24.393 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
The native people were being
squeezed for taxes and fees

00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:27.187 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
to the gods just
to keep some water,

00:27:27.187 --> 00:27:30.607 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
just to keep a peaceful
birth happening in your home,

00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:32.943 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
to keep some grains
on your table.

00:27:32.943 --> 00:27:34.653 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
It was almost as
though there was

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:37.573 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
a fear-based system
of extortion happening

00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:39.700 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
from the local priesthood.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.871 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
Akhenaten came and was
attempting to tear all of that

00:27:43.871 --> 00:27:48.041 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
down and reduce it to
no, you have the right

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:51.086 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
to be in direct
communication with your god,

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:54.631 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
as symbolized through the
sun and the central sun.

00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:56.174 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
This is your sun.

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:57.718 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
This is your god.

00:27:57.718 --> 00:27:59.887 align:center line:0 position:50% size:23%
You are part of it.

00:27:59.887 --> 00:28:00.846 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:21%
It is part of you.

00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:02.264 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:18%
It grows you.

00:28:02.264 --> 00:28:03.891 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
This was about love.

00:28:03.891 --> 00:28:05.934 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
It was about the
bringing together

00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:08.228 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
of the divine feminine
and masculine.

00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:11.064 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
They were trying to
maintain a very high level

00:28:11.064 --> 00:28:15.277 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
of consciousness, and by taking
the people's attention away

00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:17.279 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
from fear and petty
gods and turning

00:28:17.279 --> 00:28:20.616 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
toward a life-giving
source that is their own,

00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:22.826 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
they were trying to
uplift and maintain

00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:25.495 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
this high level
of consciousness.

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:29.541 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
When it went, when they
were ousted, murdered,

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:32.544 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
all the other things that
happened to that family,

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:34.421 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
the lights started going
down, and we started

00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:37.507 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
moving into darker ages.

00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:40.886 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Is it possible that this
influence from Sirius has

00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:44.222 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
positioned itself in
different time periods?

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:47.100 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
According to Linda
Moulton Howe, intelligence

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.480 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
finds its way into our
minds throughout history.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.316 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
&gt;&gt; When you look
at world history,

00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:59.321 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:46%
you could say that what happened
with Akhenaten was the first

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:03.575 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
try by an intelligence that
is mixed and matched genes

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:08.288 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
and made all these experiments,
and that you come all the way

00:29:08.288 --> 00:29:10.916 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:18%
to the 1700s.

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:16.254 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
And allegedly Thomas Jefferson
was writing the Declaration

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:19.508 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
of Independence in the garden
on the east coast of the United

00:29:19.508 --> 00:29:23.178 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
States, and wrote
in a diary that

00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:28.809 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
got reported that a
figure in a big cloak

00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:31.603 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
opened up the gate
of the garden,

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:35.482 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
as if he had the right to,
and came over to where Thomas

00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:39.736 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
Jefferson was, and laid
down an illustration,

00:29:39.736 --> 00:29:46.118 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
and said this will be the emblem
of your nation in English,

00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:50.163 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
and swept out, and that
Thomas Jefferson was

00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:58.880 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
left looking at a pyramid, 13
layers with an eye and a top.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.301 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
If that's true,
then it's possible

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:05.846 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
that the United
States of America

00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:10.225 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
is another extraterrestrial
experiment.

00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:15.689 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
They tried it once in Egypt
a few thousand years ago,

00:30:15.689 --> 00:30:17.899 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
and it didn't work then.

00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:20.485 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
And they have tried
it now in what's

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:25.615 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
called the United States of
America, and we're at about 230

00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:28.577 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:17%
some years.

00:30:28.577 --> 00:30:32.080 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; If that is true, is it
possible the Sirius connection

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.458 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:20%
is alive today?

00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:38.503 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
The thing I would argue is
that we see the same players

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:41.048 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
over, and over, and over again.

00:30:41.048 --> 00:30:44.009 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
The same energies
seem to be coming back

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:45.802 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
with the same messages.

00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:49.431 align:center line:0 position:50% size:40%
The same bodies of
knowledge keep reappearing,

00:30:49.431 --> 00:30:53.477 align:center line:0 position:50% size:44%
and at key points in history
when the mindset of the masses

00:30:53.477 --> 00:30:57.189 align:center line:0 position:50% size:44%
are beginning to open up to be
able to receive new knowledge--

00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:59.649 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
and this goes with
cosmic cycles, as well--

00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:02.611 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
when that opening is there,
the teachers come back.

00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:05.530 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
The people who are
key players come back.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.784 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
And in this time, I
think we're seeing

00:31:08.784 --> 00:31:11.953 align:center line:0 position:50% size:35%
a rebirth or re-emergence
of, not only the players

00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:14.414 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
from the 18th dynasty,
but across the board

00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:16.249 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
through these ages
of enlightenment.

00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:17.584 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
They're back on the planet.

00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:19.044 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
They're back here now.

00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:21.213 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
They're trying to do their
work in whatever arena

00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:23.298 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
they're working in
to bring this greater

00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:27.177 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
understanding of sovereignty, of
light back into people's minds

00:31:27.177 --> 00:31:31.556 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
so that they can open up
and embrace new ideas.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:34.059 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; Could the new discoveries
being researched by the Max

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:37.395 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
Planck Institute be just the
beginning of the ever-evolving

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.397 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
human body and brain?

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:41.566 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
Is the ancient
connection to Sirius

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:44.319 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
and its possible influence
helping us elevate

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:46.613 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
consciousness to a new level?

00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:49.533 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
Could new parts of our
brain be activated just

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:54.538 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
by being able to crack
the code of our origin?

00:31:54.538 --> 00:31:58.333 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; What amazes me is that this
story survived for over 8,000

00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:01.128 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
years in the Dogon culture,
and even more incredibly,

00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:03.296 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
it survives into our era.

00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:04.714 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
Think about it for a second.

00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:07.551 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
The Lord's Prayer-- if you
find the original Lord's Prayer

00:32:07.551 --> 00:32:10.262 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
in Egypt, it starts
as Amun, Amun,

00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:13.265 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
Amun, who resides in heaven,
glorious is your name.

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:15.642 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
Sounds familiar.

00:32:15.642 --> 00:32:18.770 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Could we, as humans, be
constantly repeating a message

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:22.357 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
over and over again
from an ancient source?

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:26.027 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
How does this explain our
DNA changes and growth?

00:32:26.027 --> 00:32:27.946 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
Andrew Collins
points out that there

00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:31.616 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
are new discoveries into the
human DNA that shed light

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:34.327 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
on some ancient mysteries.

00:32:34.327 --> 00:32:39.166 align:center line:0 position:50% size:44%
&gt;&gt; The Denisovans are probably
the most exciting discovery

00:32:39.166 --> 00:32:43.170 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
in the origins of
humanity for decades--

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:47.215 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
I mean, arguably even
in the last 100 years,

00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:51.428 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
because we're talking about
a previously unknown--

00:32:51.428 --> 00:32:54.639 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
well, let's say--
human population

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:56.600 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
who are different
than the Neanderthals.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.978 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
They're different to
anatomical modern humans.

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:05.483 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; Up next, we dive deeper
into Siberia's mysterious past.
