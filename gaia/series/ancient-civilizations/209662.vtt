00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Roughly 500 miles southeast
of Mexico City lies the ancient

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:90%
ruins known as Palenque.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:84%
The English translation for
"palenque" is "platform arena."

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And this powerful site is known
to house some of the finest

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
architecture,
sculpture, and carvings

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that the Maya civilization
ever produced.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Although mainstream
has dated these ruins

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:84%
to be around 226 BC,
alternative researchers

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
point to the clues that
lie in the foundations

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:84%
under this sophisticated
Maya arena that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:84%
point to a prediluvian
civilization

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.930 align:middle line:84%
in this region of Mexico 10,000
years before the Maya ever

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.740 align:middle line:90%
found it.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:10%
>> The ancient complex of
Palenque is one of the most

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:10%
mysterious archaeological
sites in all of the Yucatan

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:10%
of Mexico.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:84%
It stands apart from
other Mayan sites.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Geographically, it's
very, very different,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:84%
in a different location
from Chichen-Itza and Tulum

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and other sites like that, set
by itself in a higher elevation

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:90%
in a dense, dense jungle.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And of the many
sites on the complex,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the most
mysterious is the temple

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
that's called the Temple
of the Inscriptions.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
In this particular
temple, it is the site

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
that has the longest
contiguous record

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
of a glyphic nature of
hieroglyphs covering

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.280 align:middle line:90%
180 years of Mayan history.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Over 600 glyphs covering
180 years of Mayan history.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a collection
of three main temples

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:90%
at Palenque--

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
the Temple of the Sun, the
Cross, and the Foliated Cross.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Several notable buildings
are the Temple of the Jaguar,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:84%
the Palace, and the Temple of
the Inscriptions, which holds

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:90%
some interesting information.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It consists of an
eight-stepped pyramid

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:90%
with a total of nine levels.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
The five entrances
in the front are

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by
Mayan inscriptions,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.185 align:middle line:90%
for which the temple is named.

00:02:53.185 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at Palenque,
we see a city that was built

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.390 align:middle line:10%
in three stages or three levels.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:10%
We have the Early, Middle,
and Late Classic Periods.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:10%
And during each one of these
periods, cities were built.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Now in the Early Period,
which is very, very ancient,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.350 align:middle line:84%
they use megalithic
technology to build this city.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the Middle Period,
people came and built directly

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:90%
on top of that again.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
What you see as you look
into these ancient cultures,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
they like to build
directly on top

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.003 align:middle line:90%
of what the ancients built on.

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew that the
ancients picked the right spot.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.503 align:middle line:84%
They knew that it had the
right magnetic frequency

00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and the right resonance,
the right location.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.007 align:middle line:84%
It took a lot of the
thinking out of building.

00:03:31.007 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
What it shows us, though,
is that the people there

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
had really significantly
inherited--

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
it was a very highly
populated area.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Most densely populated
by the Mayans.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But the Mayans
truly didn't build

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:84%
any of these structures
going all the way back

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:90%
to the Early Period.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
This is some real
super deep antiquity

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
beings that came here
and built that area up.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was we
had people come and build right

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:90%
on top of it.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.910 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans literally inherited
what was already there.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:10%
>> So the Olmecs were a
civilization that predated

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:10%
the Mayans.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.205 align:middle line:10%
They may have been
more advanced.

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:10%
No one is really sure
where they came from.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But their religion and their
beliefs and their culture

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:84%
are embedded throughout
their structures,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
throughout their culture,
throughout the things

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:90%
they left behind.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Palenque was built
in three tiers.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:84%
The Olmecs really loved
to build according

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:90%
to the contours of the land.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:84%
They were really into
having their ball courts.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at the
structures of Palenque

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and how Palenque is
built, we see absolutely

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that the temples
and all the plazas

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
were built around the
contours of the land.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
centered around a big ball

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
court, which is a central
feature of their culture.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:84%
All of these kind
of things would

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
have been influenced from
the previous Olmec culture.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So what this seems
to suggest to me

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
is that the Olmecs
way predate the Mayans

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and that the Mayans
built on and were

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
influenced by what the Olmecs
had left behind for them.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Mayan architecture is
a repository of ancient

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:10%
astronomical knowledge
possessed by the Mayan

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:10%
archaeo-astronomers.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Researchers or archaeologists
refer to this as astronomical

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:90%
hierophanies.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And what this means is that
these Mayan archaeo-astronomers

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
were trying to draw down
powers into their temples.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, they
were then able to enter

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:84%
into the energy or frequency
of those star systems.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:10%
We find this, for example, at El
Castillo, where, twice a year,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:10%
the Sun would cast the
shadow on the pyramid.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:10%
And we would see the image of
a serpent winding its way down

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:10%
the pyramid.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.760 align:middle line:10%
This symbolized Kukulkan,
the feathered serpent,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:10%
descending from the
heavens to the Earth plane.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, El Castillo
became a conduit or a portal

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:90%
between Earth and the heavens.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So what these
archaeo-astronomers are doing,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:84%
again, is linking
Earth with the heavens

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and drawing down the
power of the stars

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and creating essentially
a mirror effect.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of what we see in the
complex of Palenque is that

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
much of it was dedicated to
astronomical observations.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So once again, as we
find in other places

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Yucatan as well
as into the Inca civilization,

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
the studies of Orion,
the studies of Sirius,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Venus, the studies of the Sun,
and the studies of the Moon,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
are all key in the hieroglyphs
and in the observatories

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:90%
that we see in Palenque itself.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking at
this kind of knowledge,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask, where did
the knowledge come from?

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Where did the knowledge to
build these complex pyramids

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:90%
and structures come from?

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:84%
The people that live there today
say that the Mayans did not

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:90%
build these structures.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:84%
They say that they were there
when the Mayans arrived.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans certainly made use
of them and added on to them.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Just as we see in Machu
Picchu and other places,

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
they were built in phases.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
the site of Palenque,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:84%
rather than thinking of one
complex and one moment of time,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:84%
we may very possibly
be seeing a contiguous

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:84%
record of a history
that goes back much,

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
much further we've
been led to believe

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:90%
through traditional history.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And the quality of
the architecture,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
the depth of the cosmological
and mathematic knowledge

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.050 align:middle line:84%
are contemporary with those
that we see in sites much,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:90%
much older.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
mainstream scholars,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.190 align:middle line:84%
the Maya civilization began
around 250 and lasted roughly

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:90%
until the year 900.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Long known for their Tzolkin
calendar, which mysteriously

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:84%
stops at the year 2012, the
celestial tracking technology

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.310 align:middle line:84%
baffles the minds of
alternative researchers

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and points them to look
deeper into the origins

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Maya and their quest
to connect with the cosmos.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:10%
>> As far as the
complex is concerned,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.570 align:middle line:10%
it would seem to have been
the central focus of various

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:10%
astronomical alignments of
great significance that give us

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:10%
a powerful understanding
about what the Maya believed.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
there are two temples.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
One is known as the
Temple of the Cross,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:84%
and the other is known as the
Temple of the Foliated Cross.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
They gained their name
from beautiful carvings

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
inside them of the
cosmic tree of the Maya.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not a tree.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:90%
It's actually the maize plant.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But it looks like
a tree in design.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
an astronomical symbol.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And two horizontal branches that
come out from the cosmic tree

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
represent the path
that the Sun crosses

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.570 align:middle line:84%
the Milky Way, which is known
as the path of the ecliptic.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And this very clearly
is symbolizing

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
the contact between
the earthly domain

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:84%
and what is known in Mayan
tradition as Xibalba.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And Xibalba, we interpret
it as underworld.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Which to be honest, is probably
not quite right, really.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's more the other
world or the place of the dead.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And Xibalba was reached through
a journey along the Milky Way

00:09:55.050 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:84%
from the point where this cross
on the cosmic tree is found.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:10%
And that is in the area of the
constellation of Sagittarius.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:10%
If you continue up the
tree, in astronomical terms,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:10%
there is what's known
as the Great Rift, which

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:10%
is a dark patch that goes down
the center line of the Milky

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:10%
Way.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And right at that spot
is the constellation

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:84%
we know today as
the Northern Cross,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:90%
or Cygnus, the celestial bird.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is represented
in Maya tradition

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
by a bird that sits on
the top of the tree known

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:90%
as Seven Macaw.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And this connection with
the constellation of Cygnus

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.000 align:middle line:84%
is found at Palenque in
the alignment of the Temple

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:90%
of the Foliated Cross.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Because that's aligned
perfectly onto the setting

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:84%
of the bright star Deneb in
the constellation of Cygnus.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So these two crosses, the
Northern Cross and the Southern

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Cross, were the extreme limits
of where the soul would go to

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:90%
in Maya tradition.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And in other words, the Milky
Way was like a road or river

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
into the different
paths of the afterlife.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And we find this
all over the world.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>> At Palenque and actually
many other ancient sites around

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
the world, winter solstice
and summer solstice are very

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is
because our ancient peoples

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.990 align:middle line:84%
taught humans about
planetary alignments

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:90%
and solar alignments.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.287 align:middle line:84%
Now if you're operating
star gates, for example,

00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and you have a solstice, you
have a particular alignment

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:84%
that happens twice a
year, all of a sudden,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.100 align:middle line:84%
you have something that NASA
calls X points opening up.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:84%
At these particular
alignments, these X

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.570 align:middle line:84%
points open up and create
portals and gateways

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.037 align:middle line:90%
that lead out into space.

00:11:56.037 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And I really do think that the
ancient cultures that came here

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:84%
from another planet
knew about this

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and just how they built
their stargate technology.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And that the people who were
basically being ruled over

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
or worshipping these gods, they
learned about these alignments.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And to them, it became
part of their rituals.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> As with several
other prediluvian sites,

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
the planets and stars have
played a major role for Ancient

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Earth inhabitants to choose
these sacred lands to build

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.410 align:middle line:90%
massive ceremonial sites.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But a closer look at the
Temple of the Inscriptions

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
uncovers a deeper mystery
to this sacred site.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It was in 1952 that an
archaeologist was working

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:90%
at the site.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.980 align:middle line:84%
They knew about the
inscriptions and they knew

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:90%
how significant the site was.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.980 align:middle line:84%
He happened to look at the
floor in a different way.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And on this particular
day, he looked at a tile

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
on the floor that
had evenly spaced

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:90%
holes, two rows of holes.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And he recognized
that those holes

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
were designed to
reach into the tile

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and lift the tile
away from the floor.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And when he did that,
what was revealed

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.510 align:middle line:84%
was a staircase down to
an even deeper level.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:84%
It took two seasons, two
archaeological digging seasons,

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
to remove all of the rubble,
all of the debris, that

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
had been intentionally
placed in this staircase

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to protect whatever it
that was at the bottom.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, when they reached
the bottom, what they found

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:90%
was the tomb of Pakal.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Intact, it had
never been opened.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And it existed in a
way that surprised

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:90%
even the archaeologists.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:10%
Because what they
discovered was that the tomb

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:10%
was a sarcophagus.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:84%
The body of the
sarcophagus was carved

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
from a single piece of
limestone that in and of itself

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:90%
weighed 15 tons.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.820 align:middle line:84%
The lid was another
seven tons, and it

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.180 align:middle line:84%
is this lid that has the
mysterious markings that

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:84%
have been the subject
of so much speculation.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it shows
Pakal as if he were

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
at the control panel
of a device or a ship,

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:90%
a traveling ship of some kind.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Many people have speculated
this may have been a ship

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.910 align:middle line:90%
to travel beyond this planet.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for sure,
because the records

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
don't speak specifically
to what Pakal is doing.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
This sarcophagus is so
massive that it would not

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:84%
fit through any of the
openings that exist today

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:84%
in the Temple of
the Inscriptions.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Which suggests that the tomb
and the sarcophagus were built

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and they were placed first,
and then the entire temple

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
was built around this
burial for Pakal.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Pakal's tomb is
entered from the top

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.490 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple of Inscriptions.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And as you go down
through the staircase,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.180 align:middle line:84%
it actually takes you to
the surface of the earth,

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and then below the
earth's surface

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.070 align:middle line:84%
to where the tomb
actually exists.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.875 align:middle line:90%
This is a very humid area.

00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:14.875 align:middle line:90%
A lot of rain, very moist.

00:15:14.875 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:90%
It's dense jungle.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.010 align:middle line:10%
When we get down to
the lower chambers,

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:10%
originally
archaeologists felt as

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:10%
if they were in a cave
because of the stalactites

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:10%
and the stalagmites
that had formed

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:10%
from the water percolating
down through the limestone

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:10%
to create these structures.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately today,
those stalactites

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and those stalagmites
no longer exist.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were broken away
by the early archaeologists.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have been broken
away more in recent times.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
this is unfortunate

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is because it could have
helped us with the dating.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Now what we know typically,
it takes a long time

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
to form the stalactites
and the stalagmites.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.370 align:middle line:84%
The way they are formed,
however, varies from location

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:90%
to location.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of this
evidence suggests

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that the site of Palenque,
based upon the stalactites,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
stalagmites, and based
upon the people themselves,

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
say that it is much older
than the textbooks lead

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:90%
us to believe.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.510 align:middle line:84%
We're able to
carbonate Pakal's body,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:23.810 align:middle line:90%
and it is in the current era.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But the site itself
may have been built--

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
or the beginning of that
site much longer before Pakal

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
actually began to build
his tomb as it is today.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Most scholars agree that a
traditional burial sarcophagus

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
is typically made of some form
of wood or stone that is soft

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.630 align:middle line:84%
enough to be carved
and transported.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But the 15 ton, seven feet by
12 feet limestone sarcophagus

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that Pakal was buried in was
not designed to ever move

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and can be compared to
the famous sarcophagus

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:84%
in the King's Chamber of
the Great Pyramid in Giza.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:84%
As several researchers
throughout history

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
have speculated, the
stone sarcophagus

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:14.849 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Pyramid could not
have been carried in or out

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and was not designed to
be a place for burial,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:84%
but to be a highly
energized resonation

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:84%
chamber for extremely powerful
spiritual experiences.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Could this sarcophagus
found in Palenque

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:84%
have been part of a prediluvian
path of spiritual initiation

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.750 align:middle line:84%
long before the Maya
claimed it as their own?

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.090 align:middle line:84%
The sheer size
and sophistication

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:84%
of the stones used
for Pakal's tomb,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.040 align:middle line:84%
the cover stone and
the stairs leading

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:84%
to this otherworldly chamber,
bear a strong resemblance

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:84%
to the foundation stones
found at Machu Picchu

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and other ancient
megalithic sites.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
This foundation is what
the Proto-Maya people

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
built their own structures
upon, suggesting

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that the foundations of Palenque
and subterranean chambers

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:10.620 align:middle line:84%
beneath them were created by
a prediluvian civilization.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, this is quite
unique in all of Mexico.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:10%
We don't find these kinds
of tombs very often.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of
the pyramids there

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
aren't even tombs like the
same we find in Ancient Egypt.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And so when this was found
back in the mid-1900s,

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.970 align:middle line:84%
this caused a sensation, because
they found this gigantic stone

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.210 align:middle line:84%
sarcophagus with this
huge lid on it which

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
had all these precision
carvings, 3D relief

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.800 align:middle line:90%
carvings all over it.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
With what looked like
Pakal in some kind of space

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
vehicle being shot
up into the sky.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the kind of
ancient astronaut idea.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually
a different theory

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.400 align:middle line:84%
that he was actually
descending on some kind

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual technology
into the underworld, where

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.935 align:middle line:84%
really this tomb is located
in the Palenque site.

00:19:02.935 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's take a step back from
the tomb of Pakal and look

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.420 align:middle line:10%
at it very objectively.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:10%
It's right there
in front of you.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:84%
You have a man seated
in this fetal position.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.780 align:middle line:90%
He's very open.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's sitting in
front of a big tree.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell there's a tree
trunk that comes out of him.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You see the leaves,
you see the fruit.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And the fruit essentially is
a metaphor for the wisdom.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Like the apple in the
biblical tradition.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
You ingest the fruit,
you eat the fruit,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and you take on the
knowledge of the gods.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And you keep following the
tree through Palenque's navel.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And you get to the
top of the tree,

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:90%
and there's a quetzal bird.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So the bird essentially
is the metaphor

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.360 align:middle line:84%
for the symbol of the soul,
for the rejuvenated spirit

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.595 align:middle line:90%
of the individual.

00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And the other symbol that
we know why this happened

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
is that if you look carefully on
the perimeter of Pakal's tomb,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
you have all the
different points of Venus

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and how it conforms to
its particular cycle

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:90%
in the scheme of things.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And Venus, when it rose before
the sunrise and the spring

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:84%
equinox, which is again,
detailed on Pakal's tomb,

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.622 align:middle line:84%
was the mark of
the risen initiate.

00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:10.330 align:middle line:84%
There was a phrase
that came out of this.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:84%
It was called, the initiate
who is risen from the dead.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Although thousands
of miles apart,

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:84%
ancient cultures throughout
Central America and Egypt have

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:90%
worshipped a feathered serpent.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.800 align:middle line:84%
In Egyptian mythology,
the feathered serpent

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:84%
is most often associated
with rulers, kings or queens.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Usually as protectors
or guardians.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
The mythological figure of the
feathered or plumed serpent

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:84%
is depicted throughout
South America as Kukulkan

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.750 align:middle line:84%
to the Maya and
Quetzalcoatl to the Aztecs.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:84%
With evidence mounting that
this sarcophagus may have been

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:84%
placed long before the Temple
of the Inscriptions was built,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
the question becomes, how long
before the temple was built?

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:84%
If Palenque seems to represent
this serpent imagery and belief

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
system, could there
be another connection

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:90%
between the two civilizations?

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at
Mayan symbolism and look

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:10%
for correspondences
around the world,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:10%
we find a very important
one to Ancient Egypt.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:10%
The link is Lord
Pakal's sarcophagus lid,

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:27.135 align:middle line:10%
which is the Ancient Mayans'
most prized artifact.

00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:28.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's one
of the greatest

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.220 align:middle line:84%
archaeological
discoveries in the world.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
What is important
about this is that when

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Lord Pakal is shown in his
tomb, he has a green jade mask.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.840 align:middle line:90%
He becomes the maize god.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.810 align:middle line:84%
He's effectively
becoming the green man.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
He is, to the Ancient
Egyptians, Osiris.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And his lid portrays
him on the tree

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:84%
of life, which is identical
in symbolism to a device

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that we find at Abydos that
I call the Osiris device.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing
here is, in fact,

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Lord Pakal in the
act of resurrection.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:84%
That correspondence
can't be by chance.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that
they're both in the act

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:84%
of regenerating or renewing
or resurrecting themselves

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:90%
affirms this connection.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Central America was one
of the main territories that

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.135 align:middle line:10%
Atlantean civilization
was taking care

00:22:19.135 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:10%
of because of the portals
that you have there.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Mainly because of
the telluric energy

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that is moving there from all
the middle part of Mexico.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Every one of the portals,
every one of the gates,

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:84%
was controlled by someone
called a Blue One.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans were normal
people but ruled or guided

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.160 align:middle line:90%
by the Blue Ones.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And those Blue Ones
were like the leaders

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:90%
of each one of their nodes.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So as Krishna, for example,
is a Blue One in Asia, Osiris,

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
a Blue One in Egypt, Pakal
was a Blue One for Mexico.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
So they were the leaders
of the territory,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:90%
the guides of the families.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So they were the keepers of
the portals and taking care

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that everything was according to
what the main civilization was

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:90%
saying.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Northwest of Palenque, in the
sacred Olmec site known as La

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Venta, massive stone heads,
which are carved from nearly

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:36.090 align:middle line:84%
impenetrable basalt, along with
green jade masks that share

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:84%
similar features with the
mask found in Palenque,

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.980 align:middle line:84%
connect Lord Pakal to a
possible Olmec bloodline.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But when were they
in this region?

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:84%
A defining prediluvian
link is found

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient Olmec carving
labeled Stela 19, which

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:84%
contains the serpent
depiction of Kukulkan

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
and an ancient handbag nearly
identical to the handbags

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
depicted in the
Assyrian Tree of Life.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:14.480 align:middle line:10%
If Mayan, Hindu, Egyptian,
Sumerian, and Olmec symbolism

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:10%
are similar, could
that mean that they all

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.830 align:middle line:10%
shared the same ancestors?

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:10%
>> The local tradition talks
about how a group of gods

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.920 align:middle line:10%
called the Itz originally
came from a sunken land

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.550 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of the great
ocean in the east called Atl,

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:10%
from where we get
the word "Atlantic."

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And they arrive in the
Yucatan Peninsula in 9600 BC.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a very
definite moment in time.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And it happens to be within 100
years of the known time of when

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:90%
the flood subsided.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's a historical
moment where

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
these survivors from this place
in the middle of the Atlantic

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
arrive in the Yucatan, and
slowly they made their way

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:90%
south towards Palenque.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And they set up the
original temples.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Now over time,
because of the way

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that the temple is aligned
to these specific stars,

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:90%
the stars begin to move.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Now to make the temple
do what it does,

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:84%
it has to be always
perfectly aligned

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:90%
to the background of the stars.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So Palenque keeps growing
and growing and growing.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.300 align:middle line:84%
There are pyramids within
pyramids within pyramids.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So what we see in the
classic time of Palenque

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and especially the
main building, which

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.680 align:middle line:84%
is the Temple of
Inscriptions, if you look

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:84%
at the alignment
of that building

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:84%
relative to the horizon,
it matches the position

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
of the constellation
of Draco, which

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.370 align:middle line:84%
is the celestial dragon
or the celestial serpent

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:36.260 align:middle line:84%
exactly on the winter
solstice of 3110 BC.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Ironically the same day that
the first king in Egypt, Menna,

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.760 align:middle line:84%
the first pharaoh, and I quote,
of a purely human bloodline,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:90%
takes the throne.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Now what are those two
overlapping, I wonder?

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, because
the people who

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:84%
originally built Palenque
who were the Itz,

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:90%
they were called the Akanul.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And it literally means "the
people of the serpent."

00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So in all manner of
speaking, Palenque

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.360 align:middle line:84%
is a place where the people
of the serpent set up shop.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was a place where
the knowledge of the gods

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.520 align:middle line:84%
was instigated and also
played out and taught

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:84%
to the local people over
many thousands of years.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And the person
who came to embody

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:84%
that wisdom in the
historical period

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.650 align:middle line:84%
was Pakal, from whom
we know so much.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the
Temple of Inscriptions,

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:84%
we think of it being
dedicated to the Lord Pakal.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.030 align:middle line:10%
That's how history tells us.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.800 align:middle line:10%
But many, many researchers say
it's thousands of years older.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's a point where you have
earth energies that converge

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.040 align:middle line:10%
there and emerge there.

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a spiderweb
of energetic field.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's feeding into it
and releasing it outwards.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine energy
coming in and energy going out.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Energy coming in,
energy going out.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:84%
It is highly, highly energetic
and far more than just a tomb.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And because it's a convergence
and emergence point,

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.220 align:middle line:84%
this can, for very
short amounts of time,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.220 align:middle line:84%
be very healing if you
enter that energy field.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's
about death, that temple.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I think it's about the living.

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what the ancients had

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.190 align:middle line:90%
the purpose for originally.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Could this sacred site have
been a powerful healing place

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:10%
along the ancient Atlantean
initiatic path in prediluvian

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:10%
times?

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.860 align:middle line:84%
What other connections
can we find

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that may link this
sacred land to the stars?

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:10%
>> The separation between
the Caribbean Plateau with

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:10%
the North American Plateau
and then the Antilles Islands,

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:10%
all this territory
creates so much energy.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:10%
The main line of
energy that divides

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:10%
Central America
from North America

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:10%
is actually in the territory
where Palenque was built.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.790 align:middle line:84%
So it was built as a
city of connection,

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.190 align:middle line:84%
as a city where the
people from the South

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and the people from the North
would gather there and have

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
the meetings to talk
about the future,

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
about things that are
happening, and so on.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:10%
So the wise people would
go to this territory

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:10%
that we call Palenque
today to have

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.550 align:middle line:10%
these meetings and these great
ceremonies that were something

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:10%
to say, we are still together.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.940 align:middle line:84%
We are working
for this together,

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to connect the whole planet.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So this place was the main
gate for union, for unity.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And in the skies,
that constellation

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of unity, of wealth,
of being fine

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.500 align:middle line:84%
is the Taurus constellation,
with its heart,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.375 align:middle line:90%
which is Pleiades.

00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the secrets of
Palenque lead us to a much older

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.320 align:middle line:84%
prediluvian existence here
in the mysterious land

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.420 align:middle line:90%
of the Mayan Empire?

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Was this a place of
healing and connection?

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Teaching the ancients how
to unite with the stars

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:90%
and harness their true power.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:10.590 align:middle line:84%
As the torrential
storms and flooding

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.640 align:middle line:84%
destroyed some of the evidence,
the heroes of humanity

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:84%
were guided back to this sacred
land, possibly several times,

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with the
stars and eventually build

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:84%
this sacred arena
for us to discover.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.400 align:middle line:10%
There are few answers
explaining what

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:10%
happened to the Mayan Empire.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.180 align:middle line:84%
But questions remain about
their leader, Lord Pakal,

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and his connection to
the ancient knowledge

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
of how to connect with the power
of this area of the planet.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
As with all ancient cultures,
the question remains--

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:90%
who inspired them?

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening
around these sacred lands

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:57.150 align:middle line:90%
before the end of the world?

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:06.000 align:middle line:90%
