00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> 180 miles
southeast of Ankara,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:84%
the capital city of Turkey, in
the Cappadocia region is one

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
of the most fascinating and
mysterious places on Earth.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
In 1963, a local
villager knocked down

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.870 align:middle line:84%
a wall in his house while doing
renovations to his basement.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And what he found
was a secret chamber.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Even more remarkable was that
this chamber had a tunnel

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:90%
opening along one of the walls.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.850 align:middle line:84%
That tunnel turned out to lead
directly into the Derinkuyu

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
underground city, a
city lost to time,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:90%
finally came back to light.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
The word "Derinkuyu"
means "deep well"

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:84%
in Cappadocian Greek,
a local dialect.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.600 align:middle line:10%
Experts agree that
it's an incredibly

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:10%
advanced and sophisticated
feat of engineering

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:10%
that would be difficult
to reproduce even today.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Was this subterranean
world built by humans?

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Or could its origins be
much older from the time

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.620 align:middle line:90%
before the Great Deluge?

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Derinkuyu-- this is a
remarkable underground complex.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:10%
It has about 18 levels of very
sophisticated stone-cut rooms

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:10%
with corridors, with
big, circular stone

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:10%
doors between certain
passages and areas.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And it is one of the most
remarkable constructions

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.673 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever visited.

00:01:52.673 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting about this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.000 align:middle line:84%
is that they found Paleolithic
and Mesolithic tools

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and sort of points
there, suggesting

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:90%
it's extremely ancient.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:10%
>> From a geologic
perspective, the architecture

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:10%
and the engineering of Derinkuyu
is unparalleled anywhere

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:10%
in the world today
that we know of.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
These underground
cities, some of them

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
as much as 300 feet deep,
holding as many as 20,000

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
people, are carved in place
through the volcanic ash

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that compacted over a
long period of time.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.250 align:middle line:84%
This is called pyroclastic
material called tuff, T-U-F-F.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
It is volcanic ash
that has fallen.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.250 align:middle line:10%
And as that ash
has fallen, it has

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:10%
been compressed and compacted.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So it is lightweight,
and it's very porous.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.500 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to work.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But this is where the
architectural challenge

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.940 align:middle line:84%
comes from because it
is also load-bearing.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So what this means is
as the architects were

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:84%
building these massive
complexes and cathedrals

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and living quarters and
cooking quarters and storage

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:84%
quarters underneath this
particular site and all

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
of the others, the many
that connect to it,

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
they had to keep in mind
that the ceiling could not

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
be so vast, that it
would not support

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
the weight of the
overburden up on top.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And this means there
are many columns that

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
had to be left in
place as they were

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:90%
going through and building.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And you ask, why would
people go through the trouble

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
to build such a
complex underground?

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
The way they built it,
I think, gives us a clue

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
because not only they
built it 300 feet deep,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
but they built it so that the
stone doors could be closed

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.750 align:middle line:84%
only from the inside as if
they were sealing themselves

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
to protect themselves
from something.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:90%
What would that something be?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:90%
We don't know today for certain.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
My sense as a geologist
is it probably would not

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.830 align:middle line:84%
be from a flood because
it's underwater,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:84%
even though Derinkuyu is
located at a little bit higher

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:90%
elevation.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps a cosmic
event could have

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.519 align:middle line:84%
been happening during the
time that this was built

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.020 align:middle line:84%
or the anticipation
of a cosmic event.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.915 align:middle line:10%
>> I mean, you can't date rock,
which is a bit unfortunate.

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:10%
All we know is that the
Phrygians were there.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:10%
But that's relatively
new culture.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:10%
The Greeks were hiding there.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of people
have been hiding there.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
What is fascinating about
it is the amount of rooms

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.140 align:middle line:90%
that this place has.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:90%
And there are chapels in there.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
There are doors which act like
airlocks, so, clearly, keeping

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:84%
something out, whether it
was people or water or even

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:90%
cosmic outbursts.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Who is responsible for
the sophisticated engineering

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:90%
at Derinkuyu?

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible there
is more to the story

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
about who created this
architectural marvel

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient world?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
For starters,
alternative researchers

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
have noted intriguing
similarities

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
between this site and other
mysterious underground

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:90%
complexes.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The most interesting part
about Derinkuyu is the fact

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that the upper levels are
carved out almost like the same

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
quality as the Hypogeum in Malta
or the Domus de Janas tombs

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Sardinia.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:10%
It's very sophisticated,
done with extremely advanced

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:10%
technology.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:10%
There's even a tunnel
that stretches up

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:10%
to five kilometers
between Derinkuyu

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:10%
and another underground
city called Kaymakli.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at very
advanced engineering

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
potentially from a
very, very early era.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the fascinating things
about Derinkuyu is the fact

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.070 align:middle line:84%
that it is not an
isolated underground city.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Although it is 300
feet underground

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and held over
20,000 or so people,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:84%
it is connected to over 200
additional cities located

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
many miles beyond
where this site is.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
The interesting, really
interesting thing

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
is that many of the cities are
built with slightly different

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:90%
architecture.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of the other cities, for
example, are not quite as deep,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:90%
or the passages are narrower.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And they have more
levels of the chambers,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.260 align:middle line:84%
very, very different than the
minimal number of chambers

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:84%
that we see at Derinkuyu
with the massive rooms that

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.040 align:middle line:90%
are there.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:90%
They were connected.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And it made it
possible for people

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.200 align:middle line:84%
to live and to
commute and to have

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
commerce and trade for
extended periods of time

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%
under the ground.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.630 align:middle line:10%
Why would a population
go through the trouble

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:10%
to do this unless they feared
that something above the ground

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.645 align:middle line:10%
level threatened their
existence, their survival,

00:06:50.645 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:10%
or their way of life?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it possible that
humans with little advanced

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
technological tools at their
disposal created this network

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
of underground cities stretching
for miles in every direction?

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Alternative researchers are
sure about one thing concerning

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
this small town south of
Cappadocia in the Nevsehir

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:90%
province of Turkey.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
There is an important
story to tell here

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:90%
about our long-lost past.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
They believe that what
happened here may not

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
be what mainstream
archaeologists have

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
been insisting on for
the last 60 years.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream archaeologists
have two competing theories

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:84%
about the age of this
breathtaking site.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The first considers
that this city

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.540 align:middle line:84%
may have been constructed
by the Hittite people

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
around 3,300 years ago to
help them withstand attacks

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:90%
from various enemies.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Another equally
common idea supposes

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
that this place was
constructed by the Phrygians

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:84%
500 years later in the eighth
century before Common Era.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
This theory assumes
that the Phrygians, who

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:84%
were known to be very
sophisticated architects

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and builders during the Iron
Age, built this hideaway.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But is there an
alternative possibility?

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Could it be the age of this site
goes back thousands of years

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
before mainstream
archaeologists insist to a time

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
before the Great Flooding
of the Younger Dryas period?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Derinkuyu is the largest
and the best explored

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:10%
of the underground cities in
the central area of Turkey known

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:10%
as Cappadocia.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And there are underground
cities and dozens

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of other much smaller
complexes, most of which

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:90%
have never, ever been explored.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But what's also
important about Derinkuyu

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is that there's
evidence that it could

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:90%
be as much as 12,000 years old.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:10%
And this knowledge
comes from the work

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.710 align:middle line:10%
of an archaeologist, who was
also the curator of Derinkuyu,

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:10%
whose name was Omer Demir.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.380 align:middle line:10%
I went to Turkey,
and I found him.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:10%
And I said, tell
me what evidence

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.770 align:middle line:10%
it was that convinced
you that Derinkuyu could

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.880 align:middle line:10%
be 12,000 years old and
was actually constructed

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.680 align:middle line:10%
by so-called
Paleolithic peoples.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And he took me down
to the first level.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me the
walls, and he said, look,

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.190 align:middle line:84%
these have been cut
using stone tools.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.460 align:middle line:84%
He took me down into the next
level, and it was much cruder.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:90%
He says, look here.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
These have been cut
using metal tools, which

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:84%
shows that this
must have happened

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.390 align:middle line:90%
during or after the Bronze Age.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And then he gave me the
key piece of evidence.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
On a riverbank, just a
few miles away, what he

00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:84%
found was Paleolithic stone
tools amongst the spoil.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And this was the key
piece of evidence

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
that told him that these
structures must date back

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:90%
at least 12,000 years.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So what's happened, of course,
is that much later cultures

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:84%
have found this original
underground complex

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and then dug down even further
to make more and more levels,

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:84%
more and more floors until
you get the city that's there

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:10%
>> What's really amazing, there
are ventilation shafts leading

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.510 align:middle line:10%
from the deepest levels, all the
way to the top level and even

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:10%
places in there for worship
and even for livestock.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:10%
So people can go down
there and live down there

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:10%
for literally years at a time.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is
these ventilation shafts were

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.740 align:middle line:84%
so fine and so very
small, it would

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:84%
have to have been some
type of advanced technology

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
to create these shafts
through this tunnel.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that's
interesting is

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
there is no evidence
of any collapse.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So what that tells
us is the people

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
were very well-aware of
how to work this material,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:90%
how to excavate it.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a lot
of foreplanning

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
knowing how to create a
structure that goes that deep

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that can house and
hold that much weight

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and that many people
without collapse.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
So it begs to ask the
question, could this

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
have been built by an advanced
civilization millennia

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:84%
ago, long before anybody
else stumbled across it?

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that
it may have been

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
built by advanced beings
that are not of this world.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If Derinkuyu is at
least 12,000 years old,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
could there be more to the
prediluvian story of why it was

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:90%
built in the first place?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Alternative researchers
understand not far

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
from the Derinkuyu complex
is one of the most intriguing

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
early temple sites in
the world, Gobekli Tepe,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.950 align:middle line:84%
a site that has evidence
showing that it was carefully

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:90%
buried nearly 12,000 years ago.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:10%
If Derinkuyu is, in fact,
much older than archaeologists

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:10%
claim, is it possible there is
a connection between this site

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.720 align:middle line:10%
and Gobekli Tepe?

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the unsolved mysteries
of Gobekli Tepe is the fact

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.020 align:middle line:10%
that each of these circular
temples are intentionally

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.230 align:middle line:10%
buried in the hillside
where they are found,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:10%
and that that burial happened
during a time when there were

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:10%
great cataclysms that were
happening on the Earth.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
The mystery is, were they buried
to preserve what had been left

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.960 align:middle line:84%
or would have been created
for future generations?

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:10%
When we look at the Younger
Dryas and we look at the time

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.380 align:middle line:10%
that the ice was
melting, the deluge

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:10%
occurred, if these sites
were covered to protect them

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.880 align:middle line:10%
during the time of the
deluge or during the time

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:10%
of the catastrophes
following the Dryas, what

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:10%
it says to us is
that they existed

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:10%
before those things happen.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So, once again, we're
faced with the question,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:84%
were these sites,
like Gobekli Tepe--

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
were they built
during the Ice Age,

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
perhaps during a warming
period within the Pleistocene

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:84%
while the Ice Age
officially was still intact?

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>> My observation of Gobekli
Tepe is that it was beautifully

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
encased as though people were
protecting it from something.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:84%
It was lovingly protected with
an overlapping wall of stones

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and then slowly filled
in with material

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:84%
but that in such
a delicate matter

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.237 align:middle line:84%
as though they're
expecting something

00:13:35.237 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:84%
is coming out of the
sky, or something

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:90%
is going to destroy it.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:10%
And it's as though
they're expecting

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:10%
it to come back sometime
after the event and dig it up,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:10%
and Gobekli Tepe is still
in perfect condition.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.047 align:middle line:10%
So I just put one
and one together.

00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:10%
I figured I wonder
if it was something

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:10%
to do with the Great Flood.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.250 align:middle line:10%
So 9703 BC is the average
archaeological and also

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:10%
geological date for
the Great Flood.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I reasoned
that if they buried

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe as a
means of preserving it

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.240 align:middle line:84%
for some future
date, they were then

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:84%
found themselves protection
inside a cave system

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
for a considerable
period of time,

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:84%
which really links into
the cave systems in Turkey.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Why the cave system is
so beautifully designed

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:90%
to prevent water from coming in?

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's beautiful.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have these massive
rolling stones almost out

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.070 align:middle line:84%
of the "Indiana
Jones," which you

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
can move the stones
from cave to cave,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and they will literally
form a watertight seal.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
That suggests to me that
people were well-prepared.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They're well
forewarned in an event.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
event has subsided

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
and things are getting back to
normal, that people come out

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.080 align:middle line:84%
of the cave, and they
expected to go back

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.220 align:middle line:90%
to their everyday lives.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.290 align:middle line:84%
That makes a lot
of sense as to why

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe would have been
carefully preserved, packaged.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And then people would've
expected to go back,

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:90%
dig the whole thing up.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And it would have been
active just as it was before.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of the ideas about
Derinkuyu and these multiple

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
underground cities that we find
in ancient Anatolia is the fact

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that they were protecting
people from cometary debris.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
They were potentially
protecting people from invaders.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we're
finding Paleolithic

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and Mesolithic
activity here suggest

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
they could have even been built
around the time of Gobekli

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Tepe, which is nearly 12,000
years old, even older possibly.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And we know that Gobekli
Tepe was deliberately

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:90%
covered up and protected.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps the people there
moved to Derinkuyu area

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
to actually hide from the
cometary debris, which

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.960 align:middle line:84%
may have been occurring during
the Younger Dryas impact event.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Was there a supernova?

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Were there solar flares, a
Coronal Mass Ejection, a CME,

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:84%
during this time that
have happened many times

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
throughout history, creating
magnetic disturbances

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:84%
in the sky that
would certainly have

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
been frightening to
an ancient people?

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Or could there be
something else?

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
that either seeing

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.240 align:middle line:84%
this and the fear
of what it meant

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:84%
or seeing this and
seeing the changes

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle line:84%
in the skies around them
with the magnetic changes

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and the shifts that we're
seeing in the atmosphere

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
during the time that this
happened-- would that

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.260 align:middle line:84%
be a reason for people to
want to live underground

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:90%
for prolonged periods of time?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.110 align:middle line:90%

>> Is it possible one of the
last secrets to unlocking

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
the real history of Derinkuyu
is related to the Younger Dryas?

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Could the debris from

that the Derinkuyu site,

if it were older than it is

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:84%

an entire population from

threatening their lives

that it could have been built
to protect them from massive

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:84%
amounts of water coming from the
rains in the unsettled period

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the Ice Age
for 4,000 years past that.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So when the ice began to melt
and the waters were rising,

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Turkey is high enough
above sea level

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
that they would not have been
inundated through the rising

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:33.690 align:middle line:90%
water.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But they certainly
would have been

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:84%
subject to what is
called transient rains

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:84%
or the unsettled
weather patterns that

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
happened for 4,000 years
after the melting of the ice.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:10%
So it is possible
that these sites

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.650 align:middle line:10%
could have been built by
people who saw these changes,

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:10%
were frightened by
the changes, knew

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:10%
that life on the
surface of planet Earth

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:10%
could not be business as usual,
and opted to quickly build

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:10%
these tunnels
underground as they

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:10%
could through the soft volcanic
ash in the way that they do.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:10%
>> For modern engineering, it is
very hard to build a city like

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:10%
Derinkuyu because
of the type of rock,

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:10%
too soft for supporting a very
complex structure spread over

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:10%
85 meters in the underground.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:10%
But what was its origin?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And why was it built?

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:10%
I believe the city was built by
an unknown civilization having

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:10%
high level of knowledge.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:10%
And it was one of
the places where

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:10%
the survivors of
the great cataclysm

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:10%
lived before to
come back to surface

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:10%
because only an advanced
society, having technologies

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:10%
and high level of
geological knowledge,

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.470 align:middle line:10%
could build Derinkuyu.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.880 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, if we can
assume that the city was

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:10%
used during the modern time
by Phrygians or Hittites

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:10%
but we must also agree
that they were not

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.810 align:middle line:10%
able to build such a
kind of massive city,

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:10%
then, in my opinion, was
built in a very distant past.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> If the real timeline goes
back at least 12,000 years

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:84%
at Derinkuyu,
possibly even older,

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
who were the actual builders
of this sophisticated village

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:90%
enterprise?

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible these underground
cities were originally

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.850 align:middle line:84%
built for some kind
of advanced race

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.825 align:middle line:84%
with sophisticated
engineering knowledge?

00:19:35.825 --> 00:19:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.100 align:middle line:10%
>> It reminds me of a legend
that's not very well-known,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:10%
but that is part of
the Book of the Giants,

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:10%
where the question actually
is about them having cities

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:10%
for the Nephilim.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So for these famous
awakening angels

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
who made it with humans,
what is interesting to stress

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
is that the Book of
the Giants indicates

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, the
gods would have

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.950 align:middle line:90%
reproduced for the Nephilim.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Thus, these famous angels
would have mixed with humans

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and would have spread
the civilization.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So the gods would have built
cities precisely underground.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So it matches
exactly what happens,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
what we can discover and
see and even visit today

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:90%
on the plateau of Cappadocia.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Derinkuyu in Cappadocia
has got to be one of the most

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.830 align:middle line:10%
mysterious places on the planet.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Why do you live underground?

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, the proposed
answer is that they're

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.870 align:middle line:90%
escaping a catastrophe.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that
underground caverns and temples

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:84%
were viewed as
places of connection

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:84%
to other dimensional
beings, that caves

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and underground temples were
places where humans could

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:90%
go to be closer to the gods.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And it makes me wonder
if perhaps there's

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.520 align:middle line:84%
a connection there
as well at Derinkuyu,

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that what if, in fact, it
was built long before we're

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
told historically that
it was already in place,

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and it was there that humans
would go to meet with the gods?

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, does this
connection to the gods in these

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.320 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated cave systems
suggest an otherworldly

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:90%
connection to its builders?

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The way we would see this is
it looks like back in ancient

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
times, deep antiquity, there
were some beings that came

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And these beings utilized
the underground areas

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:26.580 align:middle line:84%
to live, to work, and, for
whatever reason, to hide.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:84%
When you look at some
of the ancient texts,

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:84%
it seems like there were a lot
of battles and wars going on,

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:90%
battles of the gods.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:84%
What better place to hide
than underneath the ground?

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea that people lived
underground is something that

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:49.770 align:middle line:10%
has a long history
in ancient cultures.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:10%
For example, in the
Vedic tradition of India,

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:10%
there's the idea of
subterranean planets,

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:10%
that there may be
creatures living

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:08.060 align:middle line:10%
below the surface of the Earth.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient
Vedic texts, they're

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
described as
serpent-like, reptilian.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:84%
They had the ability
to change shape.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes they would emerge.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So that idea of underground
places where people would exist

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.680 align:middle line:84%
has been present in a lot
of different cultures.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Underground cities were
built before Atlantian times.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.310 align:middle line:10%
It was built by
other civilizations

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:10%
that came before trying to
survive during the Ice Age.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So they created all
these places to keep

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:84%
themselves safe from whatever
was happening in the surface.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So in all the
region of Anatolia,

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:90%
there was the head of the snake.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knew that there
would start all the paths, all

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.940 align:middle line:84%
So they would carve
all this territory

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:84%
underground and from their
path to all over the world

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:84%
because from there, the
knowledge would be spread.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's why in this
land, all the people that

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:84%
came from the stars created all
these tunnels around this area

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to keep the knowledge
in the underground.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a fascinating
proposition that

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:10%
the underground chambers here
go back beyond 12,000 years ago,

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:10%
possibly built by otherworldly
beings to survive here on Earth

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.230 align:middle line:10%
and then used for many years
after as a place to hide during

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.740 align:middle line:10%
cataclysm or connect with
the gods that left it

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:10%
for the humans to discover.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the
advanced race that

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
built this incredible
structure vanished.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:84%
But they left behind
these highly engineered

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.440 align:middle line:90%
underground systems.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And they left behind a timeline
of events that pushes back

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream understanding
of ancient civilizations

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It is here, evidence of
different groups of humans

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.860 align:middle line:84%
have left marks on the
walls and the tunnels,

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:84%
groups of humans
that otherwise would

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
have perished in the conditions
of the Earth 12,000 years ago.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>> People don't go underground
unless they're hiding from

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:84%
something, and they wish to
be protected by something.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And the only other
comparative thing

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I can find in history
that is anywhere

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.880 align:middle line:84%
close to this thing in
Turkey is the Hopi tradition,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:84%
when they talked about one of
the overturnings of the Earth,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:84%
which seemed to suggest
that time about 10,800

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.420 align:middle line:84%
BC when the Earth was hit
by something rather big.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.587 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to have gone
completely the wrong way

00:24:47.587 --> 00:24:48.387 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:24:48.387 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And people had to hide in
caves for a considerable amount

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:84%
of time in order to
protect themselves

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and then to come out
and start to get back

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:90%
to their ordinary lives.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So I find the parallel
rather interesting

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.430 align:middle line:84%
that they also built an
enormous cave system in Turkey

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.065 align:middle line:84%
for ostensibly the same
reasons-- to protect themselves

00:25:05.065 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:84%
from something else
that was coming out

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.410 align:middle line:84%
of the sky that may have started
as an ecological disaster.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:10%
And in later years,
because, obviously,

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.390 align:middle line:10%
the place has been reused
again and again and again

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.090 align:middle line:10%
by different people, it
would have been really used

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.625 align:middle line:10%
as a place for getting
away from people

00:25:20.625 --> 00:25:21.750 align:middle line:10%
who are trying to kill you.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The Derinkuyu cave system is
the most sophisticated that has

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:84%
been uncovered in the
Anatolia region so far.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Its many levels
represent a timeline

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:90%
of humanity overlooked by many.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.300 align:middle line:84%
But it is here that we see
the trials and tribulations

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:90%
of ancient ancestors.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Ancient texts
reveal that the gods

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.040 align:middle line:84%
built these caves to
live and to connect

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.530 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth's secrets.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Evidence that they
were built much earlier

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and then discovered by humans
roughly 12,000 years ago when

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe was carefully
buried and preserved

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:84%
has alternative
historians convinced

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
there is more to
the story than just

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.230 align:middle line:90%
a well-done human endeavor.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we can
think about the term

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
"deep well" as describing not
just a series of man-dug holes

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.360 align:middle line:84%
in the ground for safety but,
rather, a sophisticated system

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:84%
built by an unknown
group of architects

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that provided knowledge
and understanding of what

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:84%
was happening on the surface
thousands of years ago.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.380 align:middle line:84%
As humanity has endured
the hero's journey,

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
does this elaborate
cave system point

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to a time on the road
of trials and tests?

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Or was this a gift
from the gods that

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:84%
helped keep our ancestors alive
during the end of the world?
