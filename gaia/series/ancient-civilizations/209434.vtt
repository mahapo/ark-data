Coast of India,

the area now known as the
modern state of Gujarat,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:10%
has been the focus of
many mysteries that baffle

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:10%
researchers, scholars,
and spiritual leaders.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
The name "Dvaraka,"
also known as "Dwarka"

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
or "Dvaravati"
translates to "Gateway".

On the Western point
of Gujarat in India

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
sits the modern
day city of Dwarka.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
This site is one of the seven
legendary sacred pilgrimage

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:90%
sites from the Hindu traditions.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.390 align:middle line:84%
But could there be an ancient
pre-Deluvian city of gold

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
that was a coastal
kingdom on the Arabian Sea

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago?

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:10%
Legendary tales
from the Mahabharata

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:10%
recall the time when Krishna
left the Earth and his city,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:10%
referred to as Dvaraka,
was swallowed by the ocean.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists have
searched the entire coast

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:84%
of Gujarat for clues
to approximate the date

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
of this once thriving area
known in mythology as Krishna's

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Kingdom.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But will recent evidence
help us discover

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the original
mythological gateway that

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
once stood as a shining and
sophisticated city 12,000 years

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.895 align:middle line:90%
ago before the Great Flood?

00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2001, scientist from
the Indian government made

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:10%
the discovery in the Gulf
of Khambhat that continues

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:10%
to shake the foundations of
everything that archeologists

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:10%
thought they believed and
was true about this part

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:10%
of the world, about
Western India.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.270 align:middle line:84%
The scientists were
on a research vessel

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were using sonar to
determine levels of pollution

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:90%
in the water.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
The sonar began to return
a signature that was

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:90%
anything other than natural.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:84%
They were the outlines
of massive buildings,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
a huge complex
stretching for miles.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And this led to an
investigation that is still

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:90%
controversial to this day.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
The area is called
the Gulf of Khambhat.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And in Hindu traditions, there
has always been the belief

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that there was a
city, some people

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:84%
call them mythical
city of Dwarka,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:84%
where Krishna and
the gods lived,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and this is where many of the
descriptions in the Mahabharata

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.220 align:middle line:90%
are actually playing out.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, up until recently,
officially, these

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
were believed to be stories
to help convey a message

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
but not based on
anything that is factual.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
The discovery in
the Gulf of Khambhat

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
has changed all of that.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So what the scientists
have now found

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
is the remnants of a city, a
massive city, 5 miles long,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
2 miles wide, possibly
two separate cities.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And when they
began dating debris

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
found from within
the cities, the dates

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
are coming back around
9,500 years before present,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and maybe a little
bit older than that.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Placing them precisely at the
time of the Younger Dryas,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and the results of
the Younger Dryas.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
As the flooding
began, what we know

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:84%
geologically is that the
sea level was 250 feet lower

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
during that time,
during the Younger Dryas

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.650 align:middle line:90%
then it was after the flood.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:10%
So what we're looking
at is the remains

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:10%
of a city that was right on
the edge of the shore that

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.320 align:middle line:10%
was inundated when the seawall
broke and the massive flood

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:10%
happened, whether it was a
result of the Milankovitch

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:10%
cycles or the result of a
comet or a combination of all

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:10%
of those.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
We know factually that
the sea level did rise

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and it rose enough to
inundate many coastal cities.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is very controversial
because the date does not

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.500 align:middle line:84%
fit in to the history
as that history is

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:90%
written into the books today.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
once again, will we

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
allow the evidence to lead us
to the story that it tells?

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Or will we take that
evidence and try

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:84%
to fit it into a pre-existing
story based upon a theory that

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.090 align:middle line:90%
was made over 100 years ago?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're researching
the lost city of Krishna from

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
the Mahabharata, we come across
two terms which can be a little

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:90%
bit confusing.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.090 align:middle line:10%
We find the word "Dwarka"
or the term "Dwaraka."

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:10%
And as we dig deeper
and deeper, we

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:10%
find out that
these two words are

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:10%
interchangeable for the
same lost city of Krishna.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But where is this lost
city of Krishna located?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
That's another
debate that when we

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:84%
dig into the work of Dr. S.R.
Rao, who made it his life's

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
passion to uncover this
lost city of Krishna

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
from the Mahabharata,
he originally

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
landed in the city of
Dwarka, which is just

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:90%
overlooking the Bay of Kutch.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, what he noticed is that
the foundations of the city

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
go down six layers deep,
suggesting that it's

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years old.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And he thought,
maybe this is it.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But the legends
tell us that Dwaraka

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
was sunken under the ocean, so
he said maybe this isn't it.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So we started looking into
the oceans around that Dwarka,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough, he
found sunken ruins.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And he went, aha, this must be
the lost city of Krishna here.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, that wasn't good enough.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.200 align:middle line:84%
He kept digging in
the Bay of Cambay,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
also known as the
Bay of Khambhat,

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
that there was a lost
city the size of Manhattan

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:90%
some 36 meters under the ocean.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:84%
When Dr. S.R. Rao looked
at the depth of this lost

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.425 align:middle line:84%
city in the Bay of
Khambhat, he suggested

00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
that that may indicate that the
city was over 7,500 years old.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
But as we look deeper into
the geological record,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:84%
possibly the city was sunk
back in the Younger Dryas era,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:90%
some 12,500 years old.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:10%
So it's going to be debated
how old this city is.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.200 align:middle line:10%
>> They found some amazing
artifacts at Dwarka.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:10%
Right off the coast, they
found different stone tools,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:10%
they found different
wooden tools,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:10%
they found pottery, and all
different types of artifacts.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:10%
They brought these
artifacts up and it

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:10%
set the archeological
community on fire.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:10%
And what really sets
me off is the fact

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.290 align:middle line:10%
that if you look at these
tools that they found,

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:10%
these tools could not
have built this city.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have to ask the
question, how old really

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.050 align:middle line:90%
is Dwarka?

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
How many more thousands of
years older than the people

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:90%
who stumbled across it?

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.805 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered their
tools and remnants of them

00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
but they may have
just discovered

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.472 align:middle line:84%
this place that was already
built in ancient times even

00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:90%
deep antiquity.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:10%
>> What's special about Dwarka
is not only that it was home

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:10%
to Krishna but that it has
this fantastic description.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of palaces
shining like gems

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.220 align:middle line:84%
is described as
sort of a paradise.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So there must be something
enormously significant

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:90%
about the location of Dwarka.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:10%
It suggests that we really
don't know how old, in fact,

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.396 align:middle line:10%
Dwarka actually is.

00:07:37.396 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> This description leads
alternative researchers

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
to wonder, is there something
significant about the location

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.415 align:middle line:84%
of this ancient lost
city of gold and jewels?

00:07:47.415 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at Earth
energies and how the Earth was

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:57.480 align:middle line:10%
tapped into as a power source,
some Earth energies converge

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:10%
at ancient sites, and these
are called Alpha Lines.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.580 align:middle line:90%
So they have a birthing point.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:84%
So if we imagine, for example,
that beneath these places,

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:84%
energy is coming
up like a fountain,

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.190 align:middle line:84%
really strong like a spring,
bursting through the ground,

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
the Alpha Line will come up
and then it will start to flow

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and they have an alpha birthing
point and a termination

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:90%
point called an omega point.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So if we imagine that
the ancients would

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:84%
look for these birthing
points of these energy

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:84%
currents and the
termination points,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.828 align:middle line:84%
they are places that
have exceptional power.

00:08:38.828 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:10%
>> The legends of Dwarka claim
that this was one of the most

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.530 align:middle line:10%
beautiful cities in the world,
made of different emeralds,

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:10%
gold, and crystals.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.140 align:middle line:90%
It was just amazing.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And also, the fact that it's
been so deeply submerged

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
in the water suggests that some
kind of cataclysm or battle

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:90%
really did take place.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And the stories of
Krishna and King Salva

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.595 align:middle line:90%
may have some reality to them.

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:10%
>> In the archeological
excavations that they've done

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:10%
in that area, one of the things
they found was a coin that

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:10%
dated back to 9,000 BC.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is believed that it's
around this period of time

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
that the Epic of the Mahabharata
took place in that area.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this sunken
pre-Deluvian city,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
also referred to by scholars as
Dwarka in the Gulf of Khambhat,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
be the legendary Dvaraka,
lost city of Krishna?

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:84%
According to
ancient Vedic texts,

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:84%
this city was surrounded by
water and bridges connected

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:90%
this city to the mainland.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:84%
Could this submerged
discovery be a clue

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.630 align:middle line:84%
to a deeper understanding
of the mythological timeline

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
when the gods left the Earth
and there was a Great Flood

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.260 align:middle line:90%
and humanity started over?

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Krishna and his appearance on
Earth was a member of the Yadu

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:10%
dynasty.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And their capital was originally
in a place called Mathura.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:10%
And the city of Mathura
was once attacked

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:10%
by forces led by demonic kings.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And Krishna saw that to give
them a safer place to stay,

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.270 align:middle line:84%
he manifested the
city of Dwarka.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And the city of Dwarka
was on an island connected

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:90%
to the mainland by a causeway.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And it was fortified.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So he moved his family members
and other relatives there.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
When Krishna felt that his
mission as an avatar who

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
had descended on to Earth had
been completed, he went back

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and he decided that he would
take the members of his dynasty

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
back with him and cause his
city to become on manifest

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and disappear from the
vision of people on Earth.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, he caused it
to descend into the depths

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:90%
of the ocean, the ruins of it.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:10%
>> According to ancient
Vedic literature,

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.260 align:middle line:10%
Dwarka was a beautiful city.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
It was on the coast,
and it was the home base

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:90%
of the god we know as Krishna.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And he would seem to have been
not just a mythical character,

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
but an actual King
that ruled here

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:90%
into Dwarka in ancient times.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:90%
When exactly, we don't know.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But the same literature
talks about a huge river

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:90%
known as the Sarasvati.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:10%
And this, we know, dried
up as much as 4,000

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:10%
to 5,000 years ago.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So the city of Dwarka must
have existed before then.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And it had beautiful gardens,
it had beautiful courtyards.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of people lived there.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
tranquil place.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is
that it would seem

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.630 align:middle line:84%
to have been at the center
of the most hideous wars that

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.250 align:middle line:84%
were going on between different
factions at this time.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Wars that would seem
to have involved

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.376 align:middle line:84%
what we would call today
weapons of mass destruction.

00:12:56.376 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:10%
>> When Robert Oppenheimer,
the father of the modern age

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.020 align:middle line:10%
of nuclear weapons, was
asked how he felt about

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:10%
the detonation of the
first nuclear bomb,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:10%
he corrected the questioner.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:84%
"Not the first atomic
bomb," he responded.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:84%
"The first atomic
bomb in modern times."

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Could evidence here
at Dvaraka suggests

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
an advanced civilization
that had their hands

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:90%
on nuclear weapons?

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> When you look at the wars
that are in the Mahabharata

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about using these
weapons with this capability

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.783 align:middle line:84%
of destroying even
worlds in some cases,

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
some of these weapons
once they were released,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
it said that the enemy
would be defeated.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.710 align:middle line:84%
There's no question,
no doubt the enemy

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:90%
was going to be defeated.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that
when you analyze Dwarka,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:84%
you will find that
there will be vitrified

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:90%
stone, vitrified rock.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Even above ground where
their city remains,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:84%
you can find some
glass in the sand.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only way to turn sand
into glass is through high,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
high heat temperatures,
3,000-plus degrees.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient Vedic literature
tells us that during the wars

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:11.800 align:middle line:84%
that took place between
Krishna, Dwarka,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and a rival king by
the name of Salva,

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
there were weapons that were
used that devastated not just

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.810 align:middle line:90%
the cities but entire armies.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And that as much as
36 years after a war

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
that supposedly only
lasted about 18 days,

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
that there were
still what we would

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.750 align:middle line:84%
describe as some kind of
nuclear winter taking place.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Not just humans were
being killed en masse,

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
but animals were just
falling over dead.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
People seem to be
covered in something

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that they were trying
to wash off them

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:90%
by leaping into streams.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
They talked about
mutations, blinding

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
lights that were so strong
that it was like 1,000 suns.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And what it strongly tells us is
that the ancient Vedic cultures

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:17.530 align:middle line:84%
would appear to have had
these nuclear devices that

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
were set off and other
forms of missiles that could

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.035 align:middle line:90%
cause incredible destruction.

00:15:26.035 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that, historically,
the writer is being very

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.560 align:middle line:90%
accurate.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
This is important because
the rest of the story

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:90%
sounds like a fantasy tale.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
We're told that Krishna, for
example, traveled in the skies

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in his celestial chariot,
his Vimana craft.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And fact, in fact, he
battled with a nearby King

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:84%
called Salva that also possessed
one of these Vimana craft.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And they engaged in a war.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they are shooting
projectiles at one

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
another, projectiles
and missiles

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
that appear to light up
the sky during the day.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, King Salva
is raining these projectiles

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:90%
on Dwarka.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And Krishna
retaliates by sending

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:84%
some ground-to-air
missile that ultimately

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:90%
destroys Salva's Vimana.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So with that in mind and given
the factual basis for elements

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.980 align:middle line:84%
in the Mahabharata,
we wonder, could it

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:84%
be possible that
Dwarka was destroyed

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:90%
by one of these weapons?

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
We're told that
Dwarka was destroyed

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:84%
by water, that it's a sunken
city, it's a lost city.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:90%
But what caused that sinking?

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there's room or
latitude within the story

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.680 align:middle line:84%
to offer up the possibility
that it was destroyed

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
by one of these
advanced weapons,

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.445 align:middle line:84%
perhaps even a nuclear weapon
as described in the Mahabharata.

00:16:49.445 --> 00:16:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
these ancient texts,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Dwarka was attacked by
a King called Salva.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was said to have flying
machines with these kind

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.150 align:middle line:84%
of laser energy weapons
which were probably

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Vimanas, which are quite
well known in ancient India.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And it caused a huge
amount of devastation

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.150 align:middle line:90%
almost destroyed the city.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
But Krishna had his own
weaponry and he was sending up

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
thunder and lightning
from his vessels

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to actually retaliate and try
and bring down King Salva.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:84%
So we have descriptions
here of almost

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:26.640 align:middle line:84%
like nuclear style weaponry
and laser technology and flying

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
machines, all
clearly demonstrated

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient texts of India.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other things
that you find in the story

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of the Mahabharata is
the talking about Vimana,

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.070 align:middle line:90%
the aerial ships of the gods.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because you find

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
the concept of these
aerial ships of the gods

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.360 align:middle line:90%
throughout cultures.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Many times they're pulled
by a horse and this

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:58.150 align:middle line:84%
is how the gods move from the
Earth to their heavenly realm.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So in the Mahabharata there was
a lot of advanced technology

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that was used and what
was interesting is

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
that many of them were activated
by some kind of a mantra

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.300 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of intention
that got the weapon to work.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And so to annihilate the
use of these weapons,

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:84%
it said that Krishna asked
that the children of the weapon

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.210 align:middle line:84%
bearers not be
taught the mantras so

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
that the weapons
would be unusable

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:90%
for future generations.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:84%
