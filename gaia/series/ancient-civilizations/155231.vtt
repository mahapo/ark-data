00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2012, a NASA funded
researcher at the University

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
of Iowa named Jack Scudder
observed a mysterious

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
When the magnetic
field of the Earth

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:84%
connected to the magnetic
field of the sun,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
a portal to the unknown
was created between them.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Scudder named these
phenomenon X-points.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:84%
Intrigued by Scudder's theory,
NASA flew a robotic spacecraft

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
into one of these
magnetic holes.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:10%
This probe revealed that the
X-point had the potential

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:10%
to transport objects directly
to the sun's atmosphere,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:10%
some 93 million miles away.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.130 align:middle line:84%
As exciting as this discovery
was, since it had the ability

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to change known physics and
to open up possibilities

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
on a better understanding
of how our universe works,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:84%
the scientific communities
remained divided.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And deeper probes of X-points
have proved challenging.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They are unstable,
largely invisible,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and their behavior is
difficult to predict.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.420 align:middle line:84%
But what if there are signposts
that could help scientists

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:90%
locate X-points on demand?

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible
these signposts were

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:90%
used thousands of years ago?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Among ancient traditions,
there are many stories

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:10%
of places, physical locations
on the Earth, where a human,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:10%
under certain conditions at
certain times of the year,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.020 align:middle line:10%
and under certain
cosmological conditions,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:10%
can actually walk from this
world into another world.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:90%
They're called stargates.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of a
stargate, right now,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.280 align:middle line:84%
is not as far fetched
as it might sound.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:10%
and every galaxy
in the universe.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.550 align:middle line:10%
As these planets
rotate, they have nodes

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.670 align:middle line:10%
on a grid system on the planet.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And you will have
stargate they will appear.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And when everything happens just
right, a stargate will open up.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Any person or being is able to
travel through the stargate.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you enter
the cosmic web,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and basically travel through
the sun and through the universe

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:84%
through these
electromagnetic filaments.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It appears that there are
stargates that really work.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
We do now know that there are
magnetic flux tubes connecting

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:84%
all of the different
stars together

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.322 align:middle line:84%
and there's plasma that
flows through that.

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:13.530 align:middle line:84%
We do know that Earth has
a very strange relationship

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.360 align:middle line:84%
with the sun,
where approximately

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:84%
every eight minutes, there's
a flux tube that forms,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
and they are called X-points.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually when
the solar particle emissions

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:90%
from the sun come to Earth.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The solar particles
don't always hit us.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
It's when this
plasma tube opens up

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
that we get all of these streams
and showers of particles,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:84%
highly charged energetic
material, coming from the sun.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:90%
So the science is there.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:90%
The science is solid.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And stargates could
very well exist.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.233 align:middle line:84%
And these other weird
doorways carved in stone

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
are living examples
of what we can still

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
see of a forgotten technology
that was once a very

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%

thousands of years ago?

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:90%
different civilizations.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:10%
And remember, the Sumerian
accounts are of jealous gods

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:10%
essentially, gods who are
vying for influence and power.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Could mankind's ability
to find these stargates be

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:10%
the next chapter in
forwarding our understanding

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:10%
of the multi-dimensional
universe we live in?

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a stargate believed
to be a similar doorway.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.230 align:middle line:90%
It's in Turkey.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:90%
And there are others in Egypt.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:90%
There are others in Iraq.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are naturally
occurring stargates

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.410 align:middle line:84%
in the American
desert southwest,

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
that the native
people talked about.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Places like Gobekli Tepe,
or certainly the area around

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe in
southeast Turkey,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:84%
the area around Giza in
Egypt, and other places,

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
like Stonehenge in England,
they form part of what might be

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.690 align:middle line:90%
described as an Earth grid.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And there were reasons for
establishing these places.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
They all have something
in common with each other.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask me what that
is, I would probably say that

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
it's geomagnetic anomalies,
the appearance of strange light

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
phenomena-- what we
would call UFOs today--

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation of
supernatural forms,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
supernatural
entities, and the idea

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:84%
that you can achieve altered
states of consciousness

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
more easily at these
places than elsewhere.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is an elaborate
science that I've gone

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:84%
into for many years, which I
was analyzing how it is possible

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
that stone monuments can
actually function as a portal

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.410 align:middle line:90%
generator.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
That in fact, it is a remnant
of an advanced technology where

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
even something as simple as a
pure stone, if you understand

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
the Earth is naturally
giving off these bubbles,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that will allow you to
portal into other realities.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to know
where to build the stones.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And the stones actually become
like a focusing mechanism

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that capture those
bubbles coming up

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth's core
that are multi-dimensional

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and allow you to travel
through these portals.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is, what
are we dealing with?

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:10%
I think it's worth
considering some extraordinary

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:10%
possibilities, amongst them--

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.025 align:middle line:10%
which actually,
quantum physicists

00:11:03.025 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:10%
would not find so
extraordinary--

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:10%
that we live in a
multidimensional universe,

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:10%
that we're occupying one
particular dimension of this

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:10%
of this universe, but there are
many other dimensions, which

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:10%
are normally inaccessible to us
and inaccessible to our senses,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.950 align:middle line:10%
but that can be reached
in certain ways.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the
most direct gateway

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:84%
to the realm of
the gods is found

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
through the deliberate targeted
well-thought-out alteration

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:84%
That seems to me
perfectly plausible.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.880 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most famous
portals, the Bermuda Triangle,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:10%
is a good representation of
how planes and boats simply

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:10%
disappear into another
dimension, never to return.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Research on this area
is quite extensive.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But what about other
seemingly non active portals?

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
What kind of physical
elements could these hot spots

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
possess that could empower
humans or gods to tap

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:90%
into simulated universes?

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>> In that frequency,
what you need,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:84%
in order for that
to really happen,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:84%
are quartz crystal deposits,
very vast quartz crystal

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:90%
deposits.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happens our
planet has vast crystal

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.920 align:middle line:90%
deposits all around the globe.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
And that, to us, is
showing us that this

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:84%
is an area with underlying
quartz crystal deposits

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
that are strong
enough that they're

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:90%
causing tears in this membrane.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason why you get

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
such a wide array of phenomenon,
all occurring in a very

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:90%
small geographic area.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:10%
>> I think the stargates kind of
represent places where the veil

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:10%
ends and we're able to enter
into contact with spirit

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:10%
on an easier level.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:10%
Now you can look at these as
places within your own soul.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
You can also look at them as
specific places on the Earth.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of cathedrals
and ancient monuments and stuff

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
were built on ley
line nexus points,

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
for the energy of the Earth is
very strong in these locations.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And also you get people
conducting ritual and ceremony

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and whatnot over a
long period of time.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
The etheric field
of the place almost

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:84%
becomes a well-worn pathway back
into Eden or the Tree of Life.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If indeed this is true, is
there a physical place on Earth

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
that mixes the
mythological and science,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to possibly be the perfect
gateway to the gods?

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>> In Peru, near Lake Titicaca,
is one of the most beautiful

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and profound examples of
one of these stargates.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:10%
The local people
call it Hayu Marka.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Hayu Marka is a
mysterious doorway.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It is literally a doorway
that goes nowhere, carved

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:84%
into the side of a sandstone
cliff near the Bolivian border,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:84%
just outside the Lake
Titicaca in Peru.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:90%
It is on the Peruvian side.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:10%
>> In fact, the locals call
it the Gate of the Gods.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:10%
It's not something that opens.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:10%
It's just a shape
carved into solid rock.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The fantasy is that the
hero's at one time walked

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
through this into
the land of the gods.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't see how it could open.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of a
stargate, that there

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
is something that could step
into some other dimension,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
or a wormhole, would have
some kind of starting point

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:90%
and could enter.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of a doorway in
general is something that we

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
see a lot.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
We see these in the
Egyptian temple walls,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.270 align:middle line:84%
for example, where the initiate
walks up to the temple wall.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.460 align:middle line:90%
There is a doorway.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a solid wall.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
So the physical body
can go no further.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And the physical
body is left behind

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:90%
in the Egyptian traditions.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And it is the energy
body, or the soul,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:90%
that moves through the doorway.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:10%
What sets Hayu Marka
apart from those stargates

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.610 align:middle line:10%
that we see in
places like Egypt,

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:10%
is that it is believed
to be a stargate where

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:10%
the physical body moves, in
its entirety, through the door,

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.530 align:middle line:10%
in and out of the door, and
that it is active today.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
The Quechuan people, or the
local native indigenous people

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
from this part of the
world, tell the story

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.450 align:middle line:84%
of when the explorers,
the Spanish conquerors,

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
came into South America and when
they came into the high Andes.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:10%
And they tried to convert the
local people to Catholicism

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:10%
and under Spanish rule.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And the local indigenous
people resisted.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:10%
And they were chased
across the Andes.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And the last one,
the last emperor,

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
is said to have come to this
place near the edge of Lake

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Titicaca, and stepped
up onto this stargate.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And with a device that
he held in his hand,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
he placed it into a notch
that is in the wall.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And when he turned
it, he began walking.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And he walked right
through the wall.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Could this be the same device
that the Sumerians are depicted

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:10%
using in earlier cuneiforms?

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:90%
If so, how did it work?

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What the local
people say today--

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:84%
they tell me-- is that
it is an active stargate.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
There are certain times of
year that their ancestors

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:90%
continue to pass in and out.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
They continue to pass
through this gate.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Now as a geologist,
the most striking thing

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:38.160 align:middle line:84%
about the geology of Hayu Marka
is that it is a high quartz

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:90%
sandstone.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
special kind of quartz

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:90%
called piezoelectric quartz.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Now if you have a watch that
says it's a quartz watch,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
that is a piezoelectric
crystal that is in the watch.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
By compressing that crystal
with a spring just a little bit,

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
it releases an electrical and
a magnetic charge that drives

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%
the watch on a small scale.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:84%
That principle applies on
larger scales, as well.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at an area,
a geographic area, that

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
is under pressure, releasing
electricity the way

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:84%
that spring and the little
quartz would in our watch.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:84%
And if there were a place where
such a phenomenon could happen,

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:25.500 align:middle line:84%
the time travel and the ability
to move between dimensions

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:84%
is directly linked to magnetic
fields and electrical fields.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So this place is already a
high-stressed field because

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:90%
of the piezoelectricity.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And mathematically,
it makes perfect sense

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.410 align:middle line:84%
that under certain conditions,
certain planetary alignments,

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:84%
when the magnetic field combines
with that electrical field

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to produce an effect, that
we could see something

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:84%
like a stargate effect, just
like we see in the laboratory.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
When we look at what has
happened at Hayu Marka

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and the principles
that are involved there

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.415 align:middle line:84%
and parallels in
other civilizations,

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:84%
it begins to tell
a bigger story.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Gregg Braden's research
seems to parallel that of Jack

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Scudder's theory from NASA.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
For another researcher,
Sonja Grace,

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.350 align:middle line:84%
she uses her extra
dimensional abilities

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that the
gateway at Hayu Marka

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
could have been used by beings
who came from the Pleiadian

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:90%
star system.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:32.850 align:middle line:10%
>> When I spirit traveled to
the Gateway to the Gods in Peru,

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:10%
I found that we were
way back in time.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
We got there at
around 20,000 BC.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
This particular being that
came to me, his name is Muan.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And he is an ancient
Pleiadian who

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:84%
told me that this is where
they transported, literally,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:90%
to their planet in Pleiades.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians helped
develop much of our societies

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:90%
throughout time.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But particularly in this
new phase of humanity,

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
there was a group
of Pleiadians that

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
developed Tiwanaku in Bolivia
and this place here in Peru.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:22.500 align:middle line:84%
This place is referred to as
the Gods of the Seven Rays.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
They placed this
ginormous door in place

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:84%
to protect this site from all
of the things that were coming.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:10%
And that would have included
the fall of Atlantis

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:10%
and a huge civilization
that developed much later.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:10%
>> If they were placed here
on Earth to protect us,

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:10%
could these portals
or gateways be closed?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And can they be reopened?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> All these temples and
ritual centers were often used

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.330 align:middle line:84%
as places for ecstatic
experience and places where we

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.360 align:middle line:84%
could travel out of
the body, so to speak,

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and experience deeper
levels of reality.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Now whether thinking of it
as a physical teleportation,

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:90%
there may be something to that.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But I see them as
more of centers

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
in which the soul could get
into a deeper level of reality.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's, to me, more what
the stargate represents.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It's actually its manifestation.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.660 align:middle line:84%
It's its presence
within this world.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So once you use that
symbol correctly,

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
you can use it as a doorway and
as a gate to return to Eden,

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, or to commune
or mediate the spirit.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Originally, we all exist as
beings of pure consciousness

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.600 align:middle line:10%
on a higher level of reality.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are higher
beings in this universe who

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:90%
are trying to help us do that.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:84%
If you have an
embassy of a country,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:84%
that represents the territory of
that country in a foreign land.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So these sacred places that
are scattered around the world

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
are like embassies from that
higher level of reality.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And by taking shelter
in those places,

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:84%
it becomes possible
to get in touch

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:84%
with the energies
that are coming down

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:90%
from those higher places.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.860 align:middle line:84%
They may even be
portals, in which

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:38.060 align:middle line:84%
it's possible to transport
oneself to those higher levels.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that these
portals may not transport us

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.270 align:middle line:84%
physically, but they would
be able to transport us

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.222 align:middle line:84%
in a different way
to another dimension?

00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I would not be able to
back this up with evidence,

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.920 align:middle line:84%
if I were to say they were
a physical portal that

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
transported us physically
into other dimensions.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.040 align:middle line:84%
But is there a portal that
can lead our consciousness

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.250 align:middle line:84%
into other dimensions, and
in a non-physical state,

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:05.420 align:middle line:84%
to interact with the
inhabitants of those dimensions?

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
The curiosity is that you can
go into shamanistic cultures

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.660 align:middle line:84%
today, for example,
amongst South American

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Indians in the Amazon basin,
who are using ayahuasca.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can find that
the shamans, after they

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.490 align:middle line:84%
have come back from
the ayahuasca journey,

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:84%
recall the imagery
that they experienced

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
in the altered state
of consciousness.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And they paint that imagery.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And Lo and behold, the paintings
contain the same elements

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.340 align:middle line:84%
to paintings that were done
33,000 years ago in Chauvet

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Cave in France.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:90%
How do we explain this?

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:90%
And what can we learn from this?

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.300 align:middle line:84%
What those shamans
in the Amazon tell

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
us very clearly is that
in the ayahuasca journey,

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
they encounter teachers
who teach them how to live

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and how to function
in the world.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So the question is where
were those teachers?

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Are they the inhabitants
of other dimensions,

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
of parallel dimensions,
that coexist?

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Are they perhaps aware of us
when we're not aware of them?

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And were they finding some
way to reach out to us

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and to teach us what
we needed to know?

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.610 align:middle line:84%
That would be a true
gateway of the gods

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.160 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with here.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.610 align:middle line:84%
These are vehicles for crossing
that space, physical vehicles

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
for crossing the space
between dimensions.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what's
going on here.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And the technology
allows consciousness

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.250 align:middle line:84%
to cross that space
much more easily,

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and allows humanity
to learn the lessons

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:84%
that those denizens of other
dimensions have to teach us.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that portals
have been created thousands

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
of years ago to give us a
gateway to not only other

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:84%
physical worlds, but
our own self-awareness?

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.980 align:middle line:84%
As we learn to
access these openings

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.440 align:middle line:84%
in certain places
on Earth, could they

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:84%
connect us to
parallel universes?

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So all these hot
spots are everywhere.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.130 align:middle line:10%
Any ancient culture basically
looked at the landscape

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:10%
and they knew where
the energy was.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:10%
We were so connected to the
land back in the old days,

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:10%
we didn't have to build temples.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:84%
You can just go walk
about, like an Aboriginal

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.190 align:middle line:84%
person does in Australia,
and they'll say, there it is.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.077 align:middle line:90%
It's over there.

00:24:23.077 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:90%
They'll just stand on that spot.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:25.210 align:middle line:90%
They can see it.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:90%
They can hear it.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And you basically use
your inner temple.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And you connect with
the other world.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.250 align:middle line:84%
When we lost the plot, we
would then build our temples

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:90%
on top of those hot spots.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.847 align:middle line:84%
That's how we have Gothic
cathedrals, for example.

00:24:38.847 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:10%
They're built on top of the
ancient pagan sites, nothing

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:10%
very cynical at all.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So the cathedrals are built
to the same proportions

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:84%
as the ancient temples are built
to the hot spots of energy.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just the same construct.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But they become much more
physical and much more

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
manly constructed, as
we go through history.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And as we go through history,
we lose more of the plot.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So the more we lose
the plot, the more

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.740 align:middle line:84%
we build temples in
order to reconcile us

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.000 align:middle line:90%
with the natural world.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a strange irony, isn't it?

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
a very funny joke.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's written on the
temple walls of Edfu in Egypt.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "We will
keep building temples

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:84%
until people recognize
they are the temple."

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:10%
So basically, they will
look around and go, well,

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.860 align:middle line:10%
how we doing as a humanity?

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:10%
Not too well.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:10%
OK, let's put up another temple.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:10%
>> These types of theories
all point to these different

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.540 align:middle line:10%
contiguous realms that because
we are using these three

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:10%
dimensional bodies, which are
programmed and adapted for this

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:10%
particular world,
generally speaking,

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:10%
we are restricted to the
perceptions and the operations

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:49.910 align:middle line:10%
in this world.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's only after the
consciousness leaves the body

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that it starts to experience,
for the most part, that broader

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.100 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
When a person has an
out of body experience,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:84%
they continue to see their
body, like the typical one

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:90%
in the hospital.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:90%
They go out of the body.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:90%
They still see the body.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.745 align:middle line:90%
They still see the doctors.

00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:09.590 align:middle line:90%
They still see the hospital.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:11.733 align:middle line:84%
But then they're also
saying there's light.

00:26:11.733 --> 00:26:13.150 align:middle line:84%
They're also seeing
these tunnels.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Or, they may be seeing
what they could think

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:90%
or guardian angels coming in.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's all part
of the same picture.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But it takes releasing
from the body

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:84%
to be able to see those broader
things that are just really,

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:90%
in some sense, part of us.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's still a
wall of separation.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the stargate,
so to speak,

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:84%
might be that point where the
gods and where these entities

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:90%
kind of come through.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.230 align:middle line:90%
They go back and forth.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Could current military
complexes, entities,

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and ancient gods have the
understanding to use these

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:84%
stargates to travel
to other dimensions?

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how
does this knowledge

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:84%
help us understand what exists
in our own reality, and the use

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.370 align:middle line:84%
of portals to
greater dimensions?

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>> We search for portals.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual, earnest seekers
try to find such places.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Scientists try to find patterns
of energy that would suggest

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.840 align:middle line:90%
anomalies, possible openings.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we're hoping to reach a
place beyond our understanding,

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:90%
we have ordinary knowing.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.150 align:middle line:84%
We have the physical
world that we pass around

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.650 align:middle line:90%
in and can touch and navigate.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Is there more?

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is more.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:84%
How do we get in touch with
this greater dimension?

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps we pass through a door.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The actual work to find
something of a physical nature,

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:90%
that's another matter.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Could that other matter be
entrances to another existence

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:90%
right below our feet?

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> What became of the gods?

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I can
answer that question.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the survivors,
the ones that

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:84%
could still be alive
in our solar system,

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:90%
live underground on Earth.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next-- could the
gods still be among us,

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:84%
but in another reality
deep underground?

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:90%
