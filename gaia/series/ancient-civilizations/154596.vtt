00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:10%
>> On December 7, 2001, a news
article on the BBC boasted,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:10%
"Lost city found
beneath Cuban waters."

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.140 align:middle line:84%
This exciting news
came from a team

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.460 align:middle line:84%
of explorers headed by Pauline
Zelitsky, a marine engineer,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:90%
and her husband, Paul Weinzweig.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:10%
Their company worked side by
side with the Cuban government

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:10%
to try to uncover hundreds
of treasure laden ships

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:10%
from the Spanish colonial era.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
What they uncovered using
their advanced sonar equipment

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.302 align:middle line:90%
was far more mysterious.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:11.760 align:middle line:10%
>> According to
what they reported,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.710 align:middle line:10%
Weinzweig and Zelitsky had
made a deal with Fidel Castro

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:10%
in order to do side scan sonar
readings of the seafloor around

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.198 align:middle line:10%
Cuba.

00:01:19.198 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for sunken
Spanish treasure galleons,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:84%
in order to have gold
that might be found.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:84%
The gold would then be split
50-50 between them and Cuba.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And nobody else had gotten
these rights before,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:90%
so it was very exciting.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:84%
When they used the sonar on
the seabed, what they found

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.980 align:middle line:90%
was not sunken gold.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:84%
They found incredible
architectural monuments

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.740 align:middle line:90%
down there.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And these monuments
were specifically

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
located off the Western tip
of Cuba, about a half mile

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
below sea level, in very
harsh ocean currents that

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:84%
make it almost impossible
to have anything go down

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
there, except for some
of the best submersibles.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
What they saw was these side
scan sonar readings that

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
were pyramid-like
buildings, long roads,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of clearly
megalithic stone architecture.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And what we hear from some
of the original reports,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.770 align:middle line:84%
was that they signed an
exclusive deal with National

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:90%
Geographic magazine.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
This whole story was going to
go public in the summer of 2003.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And well, that obviously
did not happen.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
Pauline Zelitsky

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:84%
was leaking information
about those discoveries

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:90%
that they were revealing.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And according to
Zelitsky's reports,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
she was using a
submersible and saw

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:84%
that there were
Sphinxes down there,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and that there were bizarre
inscriptions on the stones.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we're
dealing with something

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.822 align:middle line:84%
that could not have possibly
been above sea level

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:90%
for at least 11,000 years.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:84%
She had submersible footage
of a pyramid down there

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
that has kind of a
change in the slope angle

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:84%
as it goes halfway up, kind
of similar to the pyramid

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.508 align:middle line:90%
of Djoser in Egypt.

00:02:42.508 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing a
direct relationship

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
between these monuments
and what we see in Egypt.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:90%
That, to me, is astonishing.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it suggests that
the Egyptian pyramids,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
as well, may have been
built at the same time,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and are therefore far
older than the assumptions

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:90%
of conventional archaeology.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:90%
There it is, right down there.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:90%
It's obviously artificial.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole story
somehow got suppressed.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Zelitsky estimated that it
would have taken over 11,000

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
years for such a structure
to have sunken to the depth

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:84%
at which these structures
were said to be found.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:10%
Strangely, after they
released their findings,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:10%
the news outlets and
networks went dark.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:10%
What might they
have stumbled upon?

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:10%
>> When we talk about
submerged cities,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.810 align:middle line:10%
we're lending credibility to
the emerging evidence of cyclic

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:10%
civilization.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how far back
to those civilizations go?

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
First, they appear to
occur in 5,000 year cycles.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
The historic context
of civilizations

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
is going back 50,000,
60,000, 70,000 years

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
along these 5,000 year cycles
shows up in the mythology.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the mythology is
based on much more fact

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
than we've been led to
believe in the past,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:84%
or we've been willing
to embrace in the past.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:10%
>> If this structure underneath
the ocean floor sank possibly

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:10%
11,000 years or more ago, could
this be a link to the infamous

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis?

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Atlantis is almost a catch
all term for trying to find

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.340 align:middle line:10%
the origins of
civilization itself.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:10%
This probably goes back
to the 19th century,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.090 align:middle line:10%
when the US congressman by
the name of Ignatius Donnelly

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.780 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book that was to become
the seminal work on Atlantis.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:84%
It was entitled "Atlantis
the Antedeluvian World."

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And in here, what
he proposed was

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:84%
that all of the civilizations
of the ancient world

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and the new world, the
Americas, had a mother

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:90%
civilization as its source.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:10%
All of the information that's
been left to us on Atlantis

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:10%
by Plato, the Greek philosopher
who wrote around 350 BC,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:10%
suggests that we should be
looking for Atlantis somewhere

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:10%
in the area of the
Bahamas and the Caribbean.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
But because of Ignatius
Donnelly's idea

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
that has to do with a
mother civilization,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis therefore becomes
this concept, more than an

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:90%
actual drowned city.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I believe that Atlantis existed.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:10%
I believe that a
high culture probably

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:10%
peopled those massive islands of
the Bahamas and the Caribbean.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And they may well have
been drowned, destroyed,

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
in the great cataclysm, the
so-called Younger Dryas event.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think I need to
explain the Younger Dryas.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's first of all consider
the world during the Ice Age.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's heard
of the Ice Age.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:10%
What was the Ice Age?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.910 align:middle line:84%
The last ice age set in
about 125,000 years ago.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And it saw the build
up of giant ice caps,

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
primarily on top
of North America

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.255 align:middle line:90%
and on top of northern Europe.

00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Exactly why the Ice Age
happened is still a subject

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%
that scientists argue about.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's not in dispute
that an ice cap 2 miles deep

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.160 align:middle line:84%
sat on top of North
America and a huge area

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.720 align:middle line:84%
of northern Europe-- that
same 2 mile deep ice cap.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It reaches its maximum extent
about 21,000 years ago.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
The temperatures
are warming, almost

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:90%
actually to modern levels.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And the ice is
beginning to disappear.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, 12,800
years ago, really ,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
suddenly literally overnight,
everything changes.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth is plunged back
into a massive deep freeze.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a time of
huge extinction

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:90%
of species that are wiped out.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
The new evidence that is
providing coherent sense

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to this is called the Younger
Dryas impact hypothesis.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And it has been put
forward by a large group

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of mainstream
credentialed scientists.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
said is that they

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:84%
have found evidence
which suggests

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
the Earth was hit by several
fragments of a comet.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.900 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, the
comet was out there.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It was probably a very
spectacular visual presence.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't hitting the Earth.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:84%
But 12,800 years
ago, by which time

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that comet had
begun to fragment,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.600 align:middle line:84%
had broken up into
lots of fragments--

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and the estimates are that
four of those fragments, four

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:84%
large fragments, hit the
North American icecap.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It's literally
beyond imagination.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.415 align:middle line:84%
That instant of impact would
have created so much heat

00:08:14.415 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
that it would have melted large
areas of the North American ice

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:84%
cap and sent the
water flooding south.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Then within a matter of days or
weeks of that release of water,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.298 align:middle line:84%
the freezing
temperature has begun.

00:08:26.298 --> 00:08:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's no more
release of water.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.350 align:middle line:84%
The world goes
dry at that point,

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and into a very deep, dark,
frozen period accompanied

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:90%
by animal extinctions.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.740 align:middle line:84%
The Younger Dryas
lasts for 1,200 years.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
It lasts from 12,800 years
ago to 11,600 years ago.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And then something else
really weird happens.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's been
in a deep freeze.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, 11,600 years ago,
you get a second massive pulse

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
of meltwater into
the world ocean.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
One very strong suggestion
is that the Earth intersected

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:84%
again with the debris
stream of the same comet,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and that there were further
impacts 11,600 years ago.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But those impacts
were not on ice.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Those impacts were
entirely oceanic.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.728 align:middle line:84%
You get big comet
impacts in an ocean,

00:09:23.728 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and what you're
going to get, as well

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.140 align:middle line:84%
as extraordinary tidal
waves, is a massive amount

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:84%
of water vapor thrown up
into the upper atmosphere.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And that water vapor
creates a greenhouse effect,

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
which accounts for the very
radical warming of the Earth.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:84%
It has to be rather intriguing
that that's the exact date,

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:84%
11,600 years ago, that
Gobekli Tepe is founded.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be even
more intriguing that

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
11,600 years ago
is the exact date

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
that Plato gives us for the
destruction and disappearance

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:84%
beneath the flood of
the ocean of the lost

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.265 align:middle line:90%
civilization of Atlantis.

00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>> If what Graham Hancock
is telling us is true about

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
the Younger Dryas, where can
we see evidence elsewhere

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:90%
on the planet?

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The flood also did sink
many other areas of megalithic

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:84%
architecture, such as a
gorgeous pyramid that we see

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Azores, off
the coast of Portugal.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
It's what we see around
the coast of India.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
It's what we see in Japan, where
you have sunken architecture

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:84%
down there, all kinds of stuff
that's coming up that defies

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:90%
the conventional view.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.180 align:middle line:84%
>> As a matter of fact,
just a couple of years ago,

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
a little further away from
Malta, in Sicily channel,

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:90%
was discovered a giant--

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.815 align:middle line:84%
absolutely nobody is disputing--
man-made megalith lying

00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:90%
on the bottom of the ocean.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And that bit of
ocean was covered

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
by the rising sea levels
more than 9,000 years ago,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.940 align:middle line:84%
which makes it already
3,000 to 4,000 years older

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:84%
than the established date
for the monumental temples

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:90%
on the island of Malta itself.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Some experts, like Jack
Cary, have done some alternative

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:84%
research that might coincide
with the science behind

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:90%
the Younger Dryas.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:10%
>> As far as the sunken pyramids
go, in the oceans of the world,

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:27.320 align:middle line:10%
a lot of that can be tied to
research being done by Dr.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:10%
Courtney Brown and his group
of very skilled remote viewers.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're beginning
to not only target

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
what they described
as being Atlantis,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
but through their
remote viewings,

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:84%
they're beginning
to ascertain that it

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:84%
was this very
science that caused

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.880 align:middle line:90%
the downfall of the society.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.580 align:middle line:84%
That they used it in such
a way that it literally

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
caused the destruction
of the landmass,

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and that may have actually been
part of some sort of conflict

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:90%
or war that was going on.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The fact that
there's just so many

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
of them all around the
world is what's fascinating.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has not come together
in any way, shape, or form

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:84%
the way we would want,
or hope, or expect,

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.210 align:middle line:84%
or love for it to do, ever
since the Tower of Babel,

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:84%
ever since we were spread
all over the Earth.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>> A conflict?

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:10%
What kind of conflict
could Dr. Courtney Brown

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:10%
and his researchers
be picking up on?

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Ancient texts from the
Greek philosopher Plato

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
explain in great detail
the destruction of Atlantis

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:84%
by Zeus as payback
for human arrogance.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The legend describes the
founder of the great city

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.330 align:middle line:84%
to be half god and half
human, and ruled by Poseidon.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:84%
As punishment for their
immoral bankruptcy,

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Zeus sent a ball of fire to
destroy the aquatic cities.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
The curator of the Joseph
Campbell collection

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:84%
draws some parallels
from Plato's story

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and a similar tale between
two warring Sumerian gods.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:10%
>> It is very possible
that the Greek story,

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:10%
the one we find in Plato about
a lost continent, Atlantis,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:10%
ruled over by Poseidon,
the god of the oceans,

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.060 align:middle line:10%
that this has earlier roots.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:84%
After all, storytellers
in those times

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:90%
borrowed from other stories.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:10%
And we can follow--

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:10%
it's called syncretic-- the
way information, images,

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.552 align:middle line:10%
and narratives move
from one culture

00:13:28.552 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:10%
to another,
particularly if they're

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.070 align:middle line:10%
relatively geographically
close by, which in this case,

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:10%
is true.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Sure, Enki, the great god
of the Sumerian traditions,

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.140 align:middle line:84%
could have been the
Poseidon figurine.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And the destroyer
god could have come

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:90%
from the Sumerian tradition.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
This is not only
possible, it is likely.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Zeus is the name we
are familiar with,

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek tradition,
that comes and punishes

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
the people of Atlantis, who have
achieved so much, because they

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:90%
started taking it for granted.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What could the people
of Atlantis have taken

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:90%
for granted?

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:84%
How could they have
become immorally bankrupt?

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Could this be another
interpretation

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
of a god figure striking
down upon humans

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:90%
for knowing too much?

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> What I can tell you is
that there is a recollection

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in Sumerian myth and tradition
of a time before the flood,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.790 align:middle line:84%
when a high
civilization existed,

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:90%
and when cities existed.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And then the flood came.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And everything was
reset and started again.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So what was of
interest to me in that

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.940 align:middle line:84%
is the recollection of
the memory of something

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
before the flood,
something major,

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
something important
before the flood.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Could there be a connection
between the Greek version

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.545 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis and
the Sumerian gods?

00:14:50.545 --> 00:14:53.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it is interesting.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Because we thought,
for a long time,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that Plato had been taught
by Egyptian priests.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But thanks to the Edfu texts,
we wonder if he actually

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:90%
had the copies in hand.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:90%
We will never know.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:10%
But there are very
similar elements

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:10%
between the Plato
version of the Atlantis

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:10%
and the Egyptian Edfu text
of Atlantis I translated.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand,
in a few words,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.240 align:middle line:84%
that Osiris, who is considered
to be the Sumerian god Enki,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
fled Mesopotamia to help
start a new civilization,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
according to the
doctrine of Enlil.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And he flees to Atlantis
and settles down

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:84%
on some islands in
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.080 align:middle line:84%
This ancient
territory is mentioned

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
in some funerary texts, such as
the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:10%
They call it La Mem Ptah, which
can be roughly translated by,

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:10%
"the water crown of Ptah."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Ptah one of Osiris's names.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the Egyptian
name for Enki.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Like all the other gods, he
had many different names.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We understand that Ptah
settles on some islands.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And we can identify similar data
to that of Plato's writings.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:84%
In the Edfu versions
of the Atlantis,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.820 align:middle line:84%
there are always attacks
from the forces of Set.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Set is, of course, Enlil.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.720 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
he went all the way

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt, even all the way to
Morocco, Azores, and the Canary

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Islands.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Set doesn't stop attacking
Osiris's islands.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
element to this story--

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.930 align:middle line:84%
there is a technology
that Egyptians' gods

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
used for protection--
the djed pillars.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.540 align:middle line:84%
They placed them
around the city.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, some are
even on the water.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:90%
The texts called them floaters.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:90%
They can protect the city.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can understand in
parts of the texts, that

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the energy coming
from these djed pillars,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians can control
water and create

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
water walls, very thick ones,
in order to protect the city.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Many mythologies and
legends have similarities.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.130 align:middle line:84%
We understand that
Osiris could actually

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:90%
be Poseidon or Neptune.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And Enlil, in some
ways, could be Zeus.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.310 align:middle line:84%

If Enki is connected
to this interpretation,

could the destruction
of Atlantis

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:84%
be the story of Yahweh's
wrath on advanced humanity?

Anton Parks suggests
there is a connection

it quite often.

Indeed, the Egyptian
Atlantis, La Mem Ptah,

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.450 align:middle line:90%
corresponds to the west.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
It also means "the
west" in Egyptian.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And west is also where
you bury the dead.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
We see that the idea
remains that when

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
you go towards the west,
there were many deaths.

In Egyptian history,
Osiris's death

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:10%
happens at the same time as
another very singular element

Which takes place in the sky.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
It is the fall of the Eye of
Sound, found in Edfu text.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the destruction
of a planet which was

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:90%
in between Mars and Jupiter.

the asteroid belt.

Let me explain.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.680 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, Venus was
located close to Mulge.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:90%
It was one of its satellites.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And when Mulge exploded,
its satellite, Venus,

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
is ejected into
the solar system.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%

comes very close to Earth.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Then there is Osiris's death.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
According to the text,
this was the work

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:84%
of Enlil, who
prepared his attack

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:90%

a famous Greek lawmaker who
visited Egypt around 600 BC.

And in that visit, he
encountered Egyptian priests

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
who told him the
story that there

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.440 align:middle line:84%
had been a high civilization
in remote antiquity

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:84%
that had been destroyed

But in fact, it's not

concavity on each side,
