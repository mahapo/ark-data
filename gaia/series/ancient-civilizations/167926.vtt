00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2015, paranormal expert
Mike Hallowell was called

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
in to reinvestigate a bizarre
missing persons case that was

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:84%
originally reported by a
police officer in August 1971.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:10%
The report stated that
late one summer evening,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:10%
five teenagers converged on
the ancient ruins of Stonehenge

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:10%
to tap into the vibrations.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
After setting up camp
within the stone circle

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and starting a small celebration
of sorts, a flash of lightning

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:90%
lit up the sky.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:84%
A violent storm
quickly followed.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
The teenagers carried on,
but as more lightning bolts

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:84%
struck trees and then the
huge stones themselves,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
they ran to their
tents for cover.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Things then took a dark turn.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.680 align:middle line:84%
A local policeman
on patrol reported

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
that the stone
circle was surrounded

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:90%
by an eerie blue light.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:84%
The ruin quickly
became so bright,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.700 align:middle line:90%
he had to shield his gaze.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Moments later, he
heard blood-curdling

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
screams coming from the
middle of the circle, and then

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:90%
The teenagers disappeared.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
If this police officer's
report can be believed,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is it enough evidence
to convince skeptics

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:84%
that there are more to
the supernatural stories

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
surrounding Stonehenge
than mere folklore?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Researcher Billy Carson
talks about another witness

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.125 align:middle line:90%
who saw this shocking calamity.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:10%
>> A farmer that owned the land
where Stonehenge is located was

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:10%
upset because a group of
hippies were camping inside

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:10%
the Stonehenge.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
He called the police,
and him and the policeman

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:84%
started walking
towards Stonehenge.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And as they did this, they saw
lightning strike the stones.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:10%
But instead of it just
shorting out the stones,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:10%
this very strange thing
happened where a glow starts

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.080 align:middle line:10%
to form inside the Stonehenge.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, the glow
went from a kind of bluish

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.737 align:middle line:90%
to a bright white.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was so bright
that the ball of energy

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.263 align:middle line:84%
literally reached the edge of
the outer ring of the stones.

00:02:38.263 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:84%
The farmer and the
policeman start

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.500 align:middle line:84%
to run towards this, because
there was this flash,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:90%
and then the light vanished.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
This was eyewitness testimony
and is now indisputable.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Eyewitness testimony is
provable in a court of law.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And whatever was there had
gotten completely portaled out.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Stonehenge is one of the
great enigmas of the ancient

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:10%
In the 1960s, an
American astronomer

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Gerald
Hawkins came up

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:10%
with a wonderful theory.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:10%
He believed that Stonehenge
was a great stone computer,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.400 align:middle line:10%
and that its purpose
was to predict eclipses

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.890 align:middle line:10%
of both the Sun and the Moon.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:84%
There were also other alignments
towards prominent settings

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun and the Moon
and many other features,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
which showed that it was
something which was clearly

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
built with an ancient
wisdom that went back

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:90%
many thousands of years.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> If Stonehenge was
a massive computer,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:84%
is there a code still
waiting to be discovered?

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Maria Wheatley, a
leading authority

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
on the geodetic system
of Earth energies and one

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:84%
of England's master dowsers,
explains the stone circles'

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:90%
connections with energy grids.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.930 align:middle line:10%
>> For many years now,
ever since I was a child,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:10%
my late father guided me through
megaliths and through dowsing.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's really trying to get
to the energies that influence

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and set the foundation
plans of ancient sites.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%
My family inherited master
dowser surveys and papers

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
from going back to the
1930s, so I have a wealth--

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
over 80 years of
research at my disposal.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
things about Stonehenge

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.920 align:middle line:84%
is we are so familiar
with the monument having

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.420 align:middle line:84%
those huge trilithons and being
this perfect circle containing

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
30 megaliths with
30 lintels on top.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is called
Stonehenge phase II.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
It was, according to
orthodox archaeology,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:90%
built around about 2,500 BC.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge phase I
was very different.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
It was an entirely
different monument.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So we should visualize a huge
earthen ditch and chalk wall

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.960 align:middle line:90%
bank.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, this chalk wall bank
is a bit like bricks--

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.930 align:middle line:84%
how you see modern-day houses
built in the UK, for example.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And that chalk wall
was 10 feet high.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge was a
secretive place.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
You could not see
inside of the monument.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, inside of the
monument, should you

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
be allowed to go in there for
ritual or for ceremony, then

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
we need to see 56
highly-polished blue stones.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:84%
These are stones that
are from about six feet

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:84%
high, so highly polished that
they appear like the midnight

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:90%
star-spangled sky.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:10%
Sir Fred Hoyle was considered
Britain's royal astronomer.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:10%
He was a very good,
intellectual guy.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the 1960s, he
proposed that Stonehenge was

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.680 align:middle line:10%
an eclipse-predicting computer.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:10%
So he devised a method by using
just three or four markers,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:10%
and markers were moved to
represent the Moon's north

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:10%
and southern nodes.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:10%
It was easy to predict,
for the ancient people,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:10%
when a spectacular event was
going to happen at Stonehenge.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Back in phase I,
every 18.61 years,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.680 align:middle line:84%
something truly
beautiful happened.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
From the center
of Stonehenge, you

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
could see a blood red Moon
rise above the hailstone--

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
the eclipse.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:84%
So why were the ancients so
fascinated with the eclipse?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
My research into Earth
energies, like my late father

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
before me and other master
dowsers, such as Hamish Miller,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
have all pointed out that
at the moment of the eclipse

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and just before that, the
Earth energies become silent.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
The electromagnetic energy
that they emit goes to zero.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
So it must be very important
if they were generating

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.330 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic energy from
leys that kind of transmit

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
the energy, then the whole
system would have gone silent.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And a bit like
computers today, would

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
need to reboot just
after the eclipse cycle.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that's why our
ancient ancestors were

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
recording eclipses at the
Stonehenge computer, phase 1.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> A stone circle that
was a rebooting system?

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:84%
What kind of system could this
ancient circle be linked to?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
If Maria's hypothesis
explains the significance

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
of these underground
linear lines of force,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:84%
could deciphering the
mysteries of Stonehenge

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.290 align:middle line:84%
lead us to understand the secret
technologies of the ancients?

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>> We think, generally speaking,
that the ley is a straight line

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:90%
that runs through the ground.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And some leys are
astronomical, and they

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
point to an astronomical event,
like the rise of the midsummer

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
sunrise, for example,
or setting Moon phase.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.510 align:middle line:84%
That's a
celestial-orientated ley.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:10%
Then you have other leys
that are just topographical,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:10%
and they don't have any
energy, and they just

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:10%
linked site after site
across the ancient landscape.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So we need to think of leys
as being different categories.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Some have energy.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:90%
Some don't.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Then we can come across
what's called a ley system.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And a ley system
is a straight line

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.950 align:middle line:84%
in the landscape that has
meandering currents entwining

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
So let's visualize for one
moment the caduceus symbol

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
that paramedics
wear still today.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
It contains a straight line
with two serpents entwining it.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:90%
One is male and one is female.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
the ancient landscape,

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:90%
that's what's going on.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:84%
You have a straight ley
line, and ley systems

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
have a meandering male
current and female current

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:90%
entwining it.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, these leys, once you
project them around the globe,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:90%
become a great circle.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
Celtic druids who

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
inherited the information
of the Bronze Age

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
always said in their
literature, there

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.270 align:middle line:84%
are 12 mighty circles
that go around the globe.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And one of these mighty circles
that go around the globe

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:84%
is exactly at 51
degrees latitude.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge is sited
precisely at 51 degrees 18,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's the only place
on the British Isles

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:84%
where the summer rising
Sun at midsummer sets

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.570 align:middle line:84%
at an angle to the Moon
set at its northerly phase,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.160 align:middle line:90%
creating a right angle.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
So Stonehenge was on that
latitude of 51 degrees.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
The ley flows through
that at 51 degrees.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:84%
The hill stone is sited
at 51 degrees of latitude.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, this ley then links in
not just to that latitude,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
but to where the
planets were positioned

00:09:54.810 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:90%
in the sky around about 2700 BC.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Astronomers agree
that in the year 2700 BC,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:84%
the planets and stars would have
aligned perfectly to reflect

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:84%
the stone placements
at Stonehenge.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:84%
When we study the celestial
records of the ancient world,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
it becomes obvious that
the people of Stonehenge

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:84%
were calculating the distances
between sacred energy sites

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and planets, then recreating
these dimensions by setting

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.890 align:middle line:90%
stones in the ground on Earth.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:90%
But to what end?

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
What was the relationship
between these gargantuan stones

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:90%
and the planets above them?

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a theory that
in addition to the influence

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
of the Sun and the Moon and
the power of the eclipses,

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
that Stonehenge has a connection
with the influence of Saturn.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
This comes from a theory
that was proposed,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the
1980s, originally,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that the inner so-called
horse shoe of stones that

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:84%
are made of blue stone,
which comes from Wales, which

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
is hundreds of miles away
from Stonehenge itself,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:90%
reflected this influence.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:10%
And that because they
were directional,

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:10%
they sort of pointed towards
the influence of Saturn.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, if we visualize
this on the ground,

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:10%
we need to see that
Stonehenge represents Saturn,

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:10%
and it has 30 lintels
going around it.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn takes
exactly 30 years

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:90%
to make one round of the zodiac.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Any astronomer and
astrologer will tell you

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.610 align:middle line:90%
that's called a Saturn return.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a 30-year cycle.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that's why there
was 30 lintels at Stonehenge.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Our ancient ancestors did
everything for a meaning.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:10%
Nothing was by chance.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything had a metaphysical
and a physical property

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient
world of Stonehenge.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:84%
We need to now imagine along
that line, going further

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
along it, that there was another
ancient site called Marden.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.510 align:middle line:90%
Marden was a super henge.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:84%
"Den" is an old English word
for "settlement," and "mars"

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:84%
means "Marden," the
settlement of Mars.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
Mars was situated

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient landscape
and brought down to Earth.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They were bringing
heaven to Earth.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Moving further up the
ley, you have the Sun

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and the Moon represented
by Avebury Henge, which

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
contains the largest
stone circle in the world.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>> As Stonehenge
slowly falls into ruin,

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
scientists are digging deeper
for answers about the true

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
purpose of these
stone megaliths.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:84%
The site was comprised of an
inner circle of smaller blue

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:84%
stones set in a
horseshoe arrangement,

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by a larger external
wall of 60-million-year-old

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:90%
silicified sarsen sandstones.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:90%
50 remain standing today.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But originally, it is
believed there were many more.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
The mass of the largest is
comparable to the weight

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.900 align:middle line:90%
of a fully-loaded cement truck.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:10%
>> They say that Stonehenge
was built by giants.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:10%
After all, these
are enormous stones.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.820 align:middle line:10%
It was a great engineering feat.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.272 align:middle line:84%
They say the stones
came from Africa.

00:13:20.272 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:90%
They have been studied.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.830 align:middle line:84%
They came from nearby, except
for a circle of blue stones

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:90%
that were in addition.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:84%
They did not exactly
come from Africa,

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:90%
but they came from the coast.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And the trade with Africa
was from the coast.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:84%
They were not as massive as
the major stones of the henge,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:84%
but they were still brought
from a great distance.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
This massive thing was
built at a time where it

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.170 align:middle line:90%
was quite a task to build it.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It all began with the
U-shaped construction

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:90%
on the inside.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people believed that
that U-shaped construction

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:10%
literally is symbolic of
the female human womb,

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:10%
and that's why it's
open on one end,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:10%
to be able to give birth
outwards to energy.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:84%
These weren't people that
had any access to any sort

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
of technology we have today.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:10%
And yet, they were probably
accomplishing things

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.290 align:middle line:10%
with this science that we
can only dream about today,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:10%
just using stones.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>> More astounding than the
size of these megaliths is that

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
the properties in sarsen are
comparable to the rock crystal

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:90%
quartz.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Did the ancients find a way
to regulate sound and energy

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:90%
frequencies?

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what were they
using these frequencies for?

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> When we see the stones being
routed into the energy system

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and be able to produce aerial
energy in a band form that

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:84%
communicates from one stone
to the next in cross-talk

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
communication, as it's called,
we can liken that to a large

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.430 align:middle line:90%
energy system.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Stonehenge is unique.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
There isn't another stone circle
like it in the British Isles.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Because Stonehenge has
lintels on the top.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:90%
It has a circle of perfect--

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:84%
360-degrees circle
on the top created

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
by the lintel, which
according to master dowsers

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and geomancers, makes a form
of energy go round and round

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and round and
round the monument.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And then every kind of third
or fourth circuit, the energy

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:84%
spins off towards
the heel stone.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:84%
It will always have what's
called an exit gate.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
That's a standing stone that's
slightly off to one side where

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.090 align:middle line:90%
the energy is guided to go.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
That could be likened
to something like CERN,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.660 align:middle line:84%
because that too is a
circular monument that

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
generates high-particle
speed of energy going round.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the ancients have
technology that was infinitely

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:90%
as powerful as CERN?

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Founded in 1954,
the CERN laboratory

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.800 align:middle line:84%
sits astride the Franco-Swiss
border near Geneva.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Here, the top nuclear research
physicists on Earth engineer

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
complex scientific
instruments that

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.310 align:middle line:84%
analyze the core
constituents of matter.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.000 align:middle line:84%
No one would argue that their
most powerful creation to date

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:84%
is the Hadron Particle
Collider, a 27-kilometer ring

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:84%
of superconducting
magnets that significantly

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:84%
boost the energy of particles
accelerating through it.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>> When a stone circle
has that circular shape,

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:84%
it generates a force field
going round and round and round.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So could our ancient ancestors
have been creating this energy

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:90%
field?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at this type of
energy on a particle analogy,

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
like CERN, that could be doing
a very, very similar thing.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I took an engineer of
CERN around Avebury who

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:84%
wanted to experience energy
on a different level,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:84%
so he decided to come
out with me for the day.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And he was describing to me
high-particle speeds of energy

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:84%
go into the land that they
could get from CERN to Turin,

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:84%
They could make a
particle literally

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:84%
go through the Earth at
high speed on a linear line.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:90%
It is a ley, if you will.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what our ancient
ancestors were doing.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:84%
They were pushing energy
along straight lines

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:90%
all from a circle.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:84%
So you have like a circle,
like CERN or a stone circle.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:84%
>> With the Hadron Collider,
what you have is a particle

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
accelerator that shoots atoms
around in such an accelerated

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.160 align:middle line:84%
degree that they can
literally split them down

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:90%
into their constituent parts.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
With Stonehenge, what
you might be seeing

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:84%
is an ancient attempt
at something like that,

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps they weren't trying
to break atoms down, per se.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But with both, you might
be able to open a doorway

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:90%
into another dimension.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
There are many
people who believe

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
the Hadron Collider was actually
invented to do just that--

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
that the rest of the story
is just made up to make

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
it look like it's an actual
valid scientific endeavor.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.640 align:middle line:84%
It could be that the deep
state who constructed it

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.870 align:middle line:84%
are looking to
open up a doorway.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If this might be true,
is Stonehenge more than

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:84%
a representation of our
own space-time reality?

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Is it also possible
that it might

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
have been a portal to other
dimensions in time and space?

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Time is a great treasure
and a strange mystery.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:90%
We long to control time.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
We have a great yearning
to have more time.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.340 align:middle line:84%
We wish we could go back in time
to correct an error, perhaps.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient stories explore
these deep human aspirations.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:10%
Those who go into
fairy realms may

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.920 align:middle line:10%
pass through the roots of
a tree and spend some time

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.710 align:middle line:10%
with other creatures, or
watch the fairies dance

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:10%
in the moonlight.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
When they return to
their ordinary lives,

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:84%
they may find that
100 years had passed.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:10%
In some other
stories, a person will

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:10%
go off and have long labors
and adventures and come back,

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.180 align:middle line:10%
and only a few
moments have passed.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
This bending of
time is celebrated

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
in classic stories, such as
"The Chronicles of Narnia."

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We know that time
does not hold still

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and does not act in
an ordinary fashion.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
That is, we would think
that time ticks off

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:90%
like the arms of a clock.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it is
quite malleable.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Time stretches and bends.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Einstein showed that time
isn't the same in space.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.290 align:middle line:90%
It can be affected by mass.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
that came as a great
surprise to people

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
when that discovery-- our
sense of things being orderly

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.730 align:middle line:84%
shifted when we realized
that time is not

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:90%
as uniform as we thought.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>> As humans living in
modern civilization,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:84%
we all understand that sometimes
time seems to travel quite

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And other times, it
marches very, very slowly.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Through meditative
techniques, we

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.380 align:middle line:84%
can slow our experience
of time down.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But is there a matrix
in the universe

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
we can slip through where
we can actually travel

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:90%
forward and backwards in time?

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Did the ancients create
a secret technology

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.340 align:middle line:84%
with the stones that
can manipulate it?

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.108 align:middle line:84%
>> The inner so-called
"horse shoe"--

00:20:23.108 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
because they were
directional, they sort of

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:84%
pointed towards the
influence of Saturn.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily where
it rose, but perhaps

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.970 align:middle line:84%
towards another
monument on the horizon.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But because of this, it gave
Stonehenge a quite dark aspect,

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
because Saturn is associated
with the color black,

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:52.950 align:middle line:84%
with death, mortality, and
the end of time, basically.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:90%
I find this theory a little odd.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:84%
But the association
with time, I think,

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:84%
is very important, because
these stone circles often

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.683 align:middle line:84%
seem to reflect the idea
of the passage of time.

00:21:09.683 --> 00:21:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Saturn is a
fascinating planet.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
Greek mythology, it

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:84%
was Cronos who was
actually the titan--

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:90%
the ruler of all the gods.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And Zeus, Jupiter, had to
overthrow Saturn in order to A,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:84%
survive, because Cronos was
swallowing his own children.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:10%
And there's something to be said
for this relationship of Saturn

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:10%
to Satan, the adversary--

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:10%
the time itself, the
old devil being time.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:10%
Because what do
we know as humans?

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:10%
The one thing we all run up
against that we can't defeat

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.360 align:middle line:10%
is time.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn, as this
sort of Ring Lord--

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.410 align:middle line:84%
actually, it's called
"Lord of the Rings."

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:84%
It was considered a
very destructive planet,

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and it's difficult to
understand exactly why.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Each planet has a
certain resonance--

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Mars for war.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:90%
Pluto is sort of the outlier.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Venus is for love.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
But Saturn has been
this sort of monster

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.900 align:middle line:90%
in mythological history.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You had this understanding
of Saturn and Cronos as being

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:90%
these sort of governors of time.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:20.310 align:middle line:84%
There were certain
mechanistic aspects of it.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:10%
But it was also
very fluid, and you

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:10%
have to associate the fact
that there were cycles

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:10%
within cycles within cycles.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:10%
By the time we get to the
Greeks and the Romans,

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.197 align:middle line:10%
everything becomes
very narrowly-minded.

00:22:30.197 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It's very logical, linear,
and you can't do that.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.265 align:middle line:84%
Nature is not linear by any
sense of the imagination.

00:22:36.265 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And you see a lot of that
reflected in a lot of the stone

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:90%
circles, for example.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's another layer
to this understanding,

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that although they built stone
circles to be markers of time,

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
they also understood
them to be observations

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
of the heavens, which
are in themselves

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:90%
cyclical and repetitive.

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't so much a sort
of a linear understanding

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
of the mechanics
of the universe.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.600 align:middle line:84%
It was also an understanding
that these things evolve

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.217 align:middle line:90%
within cycles within cycles.

00:23:02.217 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have to
pay attention to them,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.050 align:middle line:84%
because our livelihood--
our survival

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:11.450 align:middle line:84%
depends on the understanding
of these long cycles.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> These ideas have challenged
some to look at the Stonehenge

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.060 align:middle line:84%
differently than
they had before.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.060 align:middle line:84%
What does the placement of the
stones aligning with Saturn

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:84%
have to do with our
space-time reality?

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.500 align:middle line:84%
In 1981, NASA published photos
from the Voyager mission

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:84%
of what they are calling
"Saturn's north pole

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
hexagram," a strange,
six-pointed geometric star

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:90%
figure.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly
enough, if you look

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.970 align:middle line:84%
at an aerial of Stonehenge,
you get a similar image.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Many theorists believe
that Saturn actually hacks

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:84%
into waveform information
transmitted via the Sun

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.215 align:middle line:90%
and broadcasts a reality.

00:23:49.215 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that Stonehenge
represented a goddess cult

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.760 align:middle line:90%
associated with the Moon.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Because Stonehenge phase
I, like I've described,

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.160 align:middle line:84%
was an eclipse
predictor and it was

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:90%
associated with the full Moon.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So we need to visualize
Stonehenge phase I

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:84%
as being a goddess monument
and having moonlit ceremonies.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We always see monuments
in the daytime.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But if you're lying in
something to the Moon,

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:90%
you want to see it at night.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So I see a goddess culture
going into moonlit ceremonies

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:90%
at Stonehenge.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And with the full
Moon, chalk-white walls

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:84%
become brilliant white,
so it would have stood out

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:90%
in the landscape visually so.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Even the very narrow
original entrance

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to phase I of Stonehenge
was aligned to the Moon.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Later on, they widened
the avenue at Stonehenge

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:84%
so that the heel stone
was roughly aligned

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.000 align:middle line:90%
to the midsummer sunrise.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Any archeoastronomer
will tell you-- such

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:84%
as Clive Ruggles would say that
the Heel Stone is only roughly

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:90%
aligned to the rising Sun.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a degree out.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you look at the
lunar alignments associated

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.390 align:middle line:84%
with Stonehenge, it
is perfectly aligned.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:10%
So round about the
changeover of the lunar

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.800 align:middle line:10%
cult to a solar cult, that's
when you had more round

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:10%
monuments being built,
and the solar cult

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:24.110 align:middle line:10%
and the male-dominated
society came into being.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> This is just one of many
examples of this so-called cult

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:90%
of Saturn in modern times.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:84%
The Saturn theory
suggests that Stonehenge

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.320 align:middle line:84%
may have been built in
part as a religious homage

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.410 align:middle line:84%
to where these people
believe they originated from.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Saturn as a whole is
a very mysterious place.

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've known
its association

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
with the hexagon for a long
time because of the sixth planet

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:90%
from the Sun.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about that
is our orbital satellites have

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:84%
shown that there is a hexagon
on the roof of Saturn,

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.610 align:middle line:84%
actually, that sits
above the North Pole.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:01.140 align:middle line:84%
To see this hexagonal
shape that's

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%
forming naturally on Saturn
begs the question why.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
What's creating that
hexagon to appear there?

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not clear
whether it's caused

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:84%
because of the rings or
some kind of structures

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:90%
on the planet itself.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But the notion of Saturn being
associated with the hexagon

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and then actually finding
this hexagonal structure

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
on the roof of the North Pole
of Saturn is mind boggling.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.970 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible
that Stonehenge,

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:84%
with its placement of stones
to represent Saturn, the Moon,

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.970 align:middle line:84%
and the Sun, is actually telling
modern-day humans to remember

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:84%
who we are and
where we come from?

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
The scientist who formulated
the classical theory

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:47.230 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic radiation in
the 1800s, James Clerk Maxwell,

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:84%
had some ideas about
hyperdimensional physics

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:84%
he feared would not be
understood in his day.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote a poem
to disguise them.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.000 align:middle line:90%
"Ye cubic surfaces!

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
By threes and nines
draw round his camp

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:90%
your seven-and-twenty lines.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
The Seal of Solomon
in three dimensions."

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Billy Carson
explains what Maxwell

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:84%
means by "the Seal of
Solomon in three dimensions."

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:10%
>> The actual location of the
henge and Avebury itself--

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.290 align:middle line:10%
well, if you take an ordinance
map of the area and you take

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:10%
a map of Cydonia Mars from the
nasa.gov site and then overlay

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:10%
them, it matches 100%.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:10%
In other words, there's a
circle anomaly like Stonehenge.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:10%
There's another dome
anomaly like the big mound

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:10%
over there in Avebury.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:10%
And then so many kilometers up,
there's another little dome,

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.250 align:middle line:10%
and then there's the pyramids.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.619 align:middle line:10%
But it all matches up.

00:27:39.619 --> 00:27:41.952 align:middle line:10%
You can draw a straight line
to every single one of them

00:27:41.952 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:10%
with these 20-degree
angles, and it's

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.985 align:middle line:10%
like a perfect representation
of Stonehenge on Mars.

00:27:46.985 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:10%
In theory, every
single planet, if you

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.840 align:middle line:10%
were to take a tetrahedron
or a pyramid upside down,

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.760 align:middle line:10%
put it inside the planet--

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.920 align:middle line:10%
where the points of
the actual tetrahedron

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.350 align:middle line:10%
would touch the planet,
just on the outside of that,

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:10%
if you can imagine,
there's always some type

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.710 align:middle line:10%
of planetary geological event.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's volcanic activity,
whether it's fault lines--

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking
at Saturn, you're

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
going to see that
great storm that's

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.670 align:middle line:84%
been going on for many, many
years and it's never stopped.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:90%
It seemed to be very voracious.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So every planet that
you look at seems

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.715 align:middle line:84%
to have these
marking points where

00:28:23.715 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:84%
you can see that
hyperdimensional physics has

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.370 align:middle line:84%
an effect on the geology of
the actual planet or moon.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We were talking
about the power of six,

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.530 align:middle line:90%
which is the hexagram shape.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:10%
That comes from
the House of David.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:10%
David's son is Solomon--

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:44.860 align:middle line:10%
Sol-oh-man-- the Sun god
personified in human form.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> According to
mainstream science,

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.080 align:middle line:84%
the speed of light is the
fastest speed in our galaxy.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But some radical theorists,
like renowned author David Icke,

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
believe that Saturn
greatly influences

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:84%
space and time in our
universe, and that we are all

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.580 align:middle line:90%
under its spell.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:90%
How did this concept come to be?

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.890 align:middle line:10%
Sonja Grace describes her
alternative research that

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:10.210 align:middle line:10%
showcases a vision of the energy
forces in play at Stonehenge,

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:10%
and why she believes
the word "sarsen"

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:10%
could have originally
meant "non-human."

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When I spirit
traveled to Stonehenge,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:90%
it was the middle of the day.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And I looked around
and looked at my guides

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:90%
and said, what is this?

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this is
Stonehenge before Stonehenge.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.150 align:middle line:90%
This is what it looked like.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.550 align:middle line:10%
And they said, we
want to introduce you

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:10%
to one of the beings that
helped create Stonehenge.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And this magnificent being, who
was very tall, was a Pleiadian.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But I called them
"the ancient ones."

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And they said to me,
we have come to Earth

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:84%
at this time to help create
a new phase of humanity

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:90%
here in this northern region.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And we have taught the
people their ceremonies.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.010 align:middle line:90%
We've taught them their rituals.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
All the things that they
learn-- their medicine.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.110 align:middle line:90%
We trained the high priestesses.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:17.670 align:middle line:84%
4,000 years of training
and preparation,

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.840 align:middle line:84%
because this all
started about 8000 BC.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And then around 4000 BC, they
placed the large sarsen stones.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:84%
So the connection to Saturn was
the Reptilians also were here

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:90%
on Earth during this time.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were very, very intent
on gaining control of people

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:90%
and of the whole region.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They did not like
these ancient ones.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.220 align:middle line:84%
They did not like
their teachings.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.430 align:middle line:84%
They didn't like what they
were doing with humanity.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that
the Reptilians

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:59.160 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who built a
replica site on Saturn, trying

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:84%
to get through this
portal to Pleiades.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.820 align:middle line:84%
They simply built a replica
to actually transport to where

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:90%
these Pleiadians came from.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
how well-protected

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:84%
our airports are, you
know you can't go through

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
without going through
TSA and getting

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.840 align:middle line:90%
scanned and all of that.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.170 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the same process if
you're going to another planet.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't just drop in
and say, hey, I'm here.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:90%
I used this portal.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.760 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a real
screening process.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.150 align:middle line:84%
You had to have the code to
get through that stargate.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:90%
The same was true at Stonehenge.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And this alignment
to Saturn I feel

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:51.040 align:middle line:84%
is more out of the battle
that has gone on for millions

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.900 align:middle line:84%
of years between different
extraterrestrial beings

00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and these demigods and
the vying for power.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.840 align:middle line:84%
That's always been a part of
what's going on here on Earth.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.030 align:middle line:90%
And so the alignment to Saturn--

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it has everything to do
with the war that was happening

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:16.480 align:middle line:84%
on another level between these
Pleiadians and the Reptilians.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> If this could be true,
is there any evidence that

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.080 align:middle line:84%
suggests a different kind of
civilization used the code

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.820 align:middle line:90%
of Stonehenge?

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Who built Stonehenge?

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I went on a research
campaign, if you will,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to find out what the
people look like.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.900 align:middle line:84%
I kept being drawn, through
the dowsian principle,

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.890 align:middle line:84%
to a very large barrow
on the Salisbury plain.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And Stonehenge is sited
on the Salisbury plain,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and the Salisbury plain
is run by the military.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.120 align:middle line:10%
What I discovered was the
largest long barrow ever

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.490 align:middle line:10%
constructed in Northwest Europe
was on that Salisbury plain.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Some have a megalithic chambers
within them and some don't.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So some are classified as
earthen mounds and some

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:84%
are classified as
megalithic mounds--

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.810 align:middle line:90%
the ones with the chambers.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.780 align:middle line:84%
When I found the biggest long
mound on Salisbury plain,

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
it must have been for
hundreds of people

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.420 align:middle line:90%
that lived at Stonehenge.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.870 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:18.410 align:middle line:84%
It was decreed for one
person and one person alone,

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and that was of a woman.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.510 align:middle line:10%
And we hardly ever hear
of the prehistoric women

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:10%
in the British landscape, apart
from Boudica, an Iron Age Iceni

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:10%
queen who basically
challenged the Romans.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
research this woman that

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:84%
was placed in this
mound and find out

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.250 align:middle line:90%
who she was and the age of her.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:45.380 align:middle line:84%
She was dated to the Neolithic
period, about 5,500 years old.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And I tracked her down
to Cambridge University.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
see her, I instantly

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.240 align:middle line:84%
realized she had
an elongated skull.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Her skull was much
longer than ours.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:84%
We have round faces
and round skulls.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Hers wasn't, so she was
an elongated person.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.390 align:middle line:10%
As she must have
been high-ranking--

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:10%
she must have been a
high priestess or a queen

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:10%
to have been buried
as a single interment

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.989 align:middle line:10%
into the largest mound
in Northwest Europe.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:18.139 align:middle line:90%
And also, she had been murdered.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.949 align:middle line:84%
So I decided then to investigate
all the other long mounds

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
on the Salisbury
plain and find out who

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:90%
were buried in these mounds.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out they too
all had elongated skulls,

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and they too had all been
murdered and then placed

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.889 align:middle line:90%
within these mounds.

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> If these elongated
head beings were murdered,

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.889 align:middle line:84%
what was the purpose of
preserving their bodies?

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Could they have held
the keys to the portal?

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps Stonehenge and the
placement of its stones

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:84%
that represent Saturn,
the Moon, and the Sun

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:55.520 align:middle line:84%
also serves to prompt modern-day
humans to remember who we are

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.760 align:middle line:90%
and where we came from.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Saturn is known to
be the harsh taskmaster.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:84%
It's where we get things
like tough love, sort of--

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's not an evil
thing, but it's almost

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:84%
like you have to prune the tree
in order to exacerbate growth.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we need
a little toughness

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.497 align:middle line:84%
just to really grow
to our full potential.

00:35:18.497 --> 00:35:20.830 align:middle line:10%
So that's really-- to me,
that's what Saturn represents.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And the neat thing
with Saturn is Ketu.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It's also known-- it's
actually a feminine sign,

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:84%
but generally thought
of as a masculine deity.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Saturn imposes the
limitations of time and space.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
It's also the seventh
sphere, which is the highest

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:90%
point of the world's soul.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the point where
eternity becomes creation.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a liminal
boundary at the edge

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.230 align:middle line:84%
of the world, so to speak, which
is the highest level of Saturn,

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.640 align:middle line:84%
who was also the ruler
of the Golden Age,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.770 align:middle line:84%
so it also has a very
good connotation.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The Golden Age is said
to be ruled by Saturn,

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
so it's not all about that.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost like our
world's inside out here.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.850 align:middle line:84%
See, in Saturn, the lead
is the lowest in our world

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:03.420 align:middle line:90%
we're experiencing here.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.240 align:middle line:84%
But once we go back
to the Golden Age,

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:90%
it's actually the highest.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Stonehenge is
many, many layers.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And yes, it's a
place of learning.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a place of fertility.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.537 align:middle line:90%
It's a place of wisdom.

00:36:14.537 --> 00:36:15.620 align:middle line:10%
It's a place of gathering.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:10%
And of course, it's
an astronomical marker

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.700 align:middle line:10%
and an astrological
marker as well.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It's all of those things.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big
Russian doll without

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.160 align:middle line:90%
the Russian counterpart.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.290 align:middle line:84%
To the average
troglodyte, it just

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:84%
looks like a bunch
of arcs and circles

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.750 align:middle line:84%
arranged willy-nilly
on the landscape.

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you actually take an
aerial version of Stonehenge,

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.950 align:middle line:90%
it's perfect.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.660 align:middle line:10%
It's beautiful,
because it actually

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:43.165 align:middle line:10%
encompasses and incorporates
every facet of sacred geometry.

00:36:43.165 --> 00:36:44.540 align:middle line:10%
Now, sacred geometry
is important

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.250 align:middle line:10%
because it's basically
a distillation

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:10%
of the laws of nature.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Each geometry is
essentially a concretization

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.350 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, or a
conscious, sentient movement.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So each geometry
means what it does.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you're going
to a place like Stonehenge,

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and you'd go in there
with your intent--

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.940 align:middle line:84%
let's say you want to work with
feminine or creative forces.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The geometry that works with
those forces is the pentagram.

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, only the forces
of the pentagram

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that define one circle to the
arc of Stonehenge come alive.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.090 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the stones
actually don't do anything.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.860 align:middle line:84%
You're using your consciousness
as a key to activate part

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.090 align:middle line:90%
of the site.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it is just a bunch
of rocks sitting around.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Could those teenagers back
in 1971 have accessed this

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.320 align:middle line:90%
forbidden knowledge?

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.870 align:middle line:84%
If we could use
consciousness in such a way,

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:39.830 align:middle line:84%
could we as a civilization
use tools like Stonehenge

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.730 align:middle line:84%
as a gateway to another
dimension or another time?

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Is its purpose to
remind us of where

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:84%
we are in the grand scheme of
evolution in this timeline?

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.340 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of
the world, in what

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is considered the Four Corners
area of the United States,

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.400 align:middle line:90%
another timeline is revealed.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.400 align:middle line:10%
>> What's intriguing about the
Hopi tradition is the notion

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.840 align:middle line:10%
of previous cycles of
civilization that comes across

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.510 align:middle line:10%
which are brought to
an end cataclysmically,

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.670 align:middle line:10%
and then there's a
re-emergence and another cycle

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:12.630 align:middle line:10%
of civilization occurs.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:16.760 align:middle line:10%
That's the message that I
take from the Hopi traditions,

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:21.210 align:middle line:10%
that they are urging us
to cast our minds back

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:23.540 align:middle line:10%
into remote prehistory.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next, ancient cave systems
in the Southwest reveal ancient

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.560 align:middle line:84%
civilizations and
their treasures.
