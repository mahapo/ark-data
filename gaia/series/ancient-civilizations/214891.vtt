>> Saqqara, situated roughly
22 miles South of Giza.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.640 align:middle line:84%
This Southern region
of the pyramid field

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:84%
has long been known as a
major piece of the Memphite

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Necropolis, and
is a royal burial

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
ground for several
Egyptian kings dating back

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.120 align:middle line:90%
to the first dynasty.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.870 align:middle line:84%
As the dilapidating pyramids
and mastabas protrude

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
above the sacred
sands of Saqqara,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
the true power and
purpose of this region

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
has puzzled alternative
and mainstream researchers.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:84%
As more relics
are revealed, what

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:84%
lies beneath the
sands of Saqqara

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
offers a glimpse into a
potential pre-diluvian

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
underworld that defies
all understanding.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:10%
>> If you were to pick a
particular dot of real estate

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.170 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, this
massive planet that we live

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:10%
on, let's pick a dot that is
the strangest, most enigmatic,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:10%
most powerful, you're talking
about the West Bank of the Nile

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:10%
near Cairo, present day Cairo.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Encompassing the
Great Pyramid complex,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
encompassing Dahshur,
the pyramid of Djoser

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
at Saqqara, Abusir, Abu Gorab,
this massive field of energy

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and focused intention that we
can't even duplicate today.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And you have to ask,
why was it built?

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Who built it?

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I look at it, the
answer has to involve Orion.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
It has to involve
Resurrection, and ultimately it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:84%
likely involves the Earth
itself and this concept

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.352 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth as a generator
of resonance in Earth energy.

00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Arguably the biggest and
most important cemetery,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:10%
military area, and necropolis
is that of Saqqara,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:10%
which served
specifically Memphis.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:10%
In fact, they're both on
exactly the same latitude.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:10%
So Saqqara is where
the demarcation

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.930 align:middle line:10%
is between North and South
Egypt or Upper and Lower Egypt.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's a massive, sprawling
area of tombs, of mastabas,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.322 align:middle line:84%
of pyramids, and other
much stranger structures.

00:02:54.322 --> 00:02:56.820 align:middle line:10%
>> And when it comes to
trying to understand Saqqara,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:10%
it's very, very confusing
and disorienting

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:10%
because there's so much
going on underground.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.895 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so bizarre
about this place.

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
suggested that there's

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
some kind of magic there,
some kind of power that's

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:90%
in the land.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So we've got this
real mystical world

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.245 align:middle line:90%
going on beneath the surface.

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:10%
>> As of 2020, only about 1% of
the known archeological field

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:10%
has been excavated in Saqqara.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:10%
And this is what makes so much
of the mystery so fascinating

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:10%
for this generation
and future generations.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.075 align:middle line:84%
For so many people,
young people,

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that everything
has already been found,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
everything's already
been excavated.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
That is not the
case with Saqqara.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
We have generations of
mystery and exploration

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.032 align:middle line:90%
that lie ahead of us.

00:03:51.032 --> 00:03:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The step pyramid of Djoser,
referred to by most scholars

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
as being the first
Egyptian pyramid,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:84%
is the most famous
monument in this region.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
According to
mainstream, this pyramid

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:84%
was built for Djoser, an
Egyptian pharaoh and first king

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Third Dynasty.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
The purpose and influence
of this stairway to heaven

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.552 align:middle line:84%
has many more
questions than answers.

00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> If Saqqara truly dates to
the time that we believe that it

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
dates, between 12,000 and
13,000 years before present,

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
as part of the Giza complex, the
Djoser pyramid probably was not

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:90%
built at the same time.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It came later.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid is not
in its original form.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.732 align:middle line:84%
It is believed that the outer
casing has been stripped away,

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
looking at was never

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:84%
meant to be seen
by the naked eye.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:84%
The six levels of the
stonework that we see now

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.785 align:middle line:90%
was never meant to be seen.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at
the step pyramid,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.200 align:middle line:84%
not only is it iconic because
of the steps that it has,

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
but beneath it is an even bigger
mystery because to start off

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:84%
with a massive, gigantic area
was cut out of the bedrock,

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle line:84%
going down hundreds of feet,
and into this was placed a huge

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.070 align:middle line:90%
sarcophagus chamber.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course, within this,
the sarcophagus of Djoser

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:90%
was contained.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:84%
But leading away from this
massive sarcophagus chamber

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.310 align:middle line:84%
were a series of
tunnels that went off

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
towards the West, the
East, and the South.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And these went on for
many hundreds of yards.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And when they were explored, it
was found that they contained

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
arguably as many as has 40,000
bowls and jars that were

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
beautifully worked
in hard stone.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Many of these jars were
from the Predynastic Period,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:90%
so that's beyond 3,000 BC.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
What the hell are
they doing there?

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:18.952 align:middle line:84%
What was 40,000 jars and
bowls doing in these tunnels?

00:06:18.952 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're looking at
the step pyramid at Saqqara,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
which was built by Imhotep,
the son of Ptah, for his king,

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Djoser, you're looking at a
legacy that points directly

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.240 align:middle line:90%
to Sirius.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Because as the son
of Ptah, Imhotep,

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is considered the first
polymath on Earth,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:90%
he's the Da Vinci of his time.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Imhotep was skilled in
architecture, philosophy,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:10%
and medicine.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:10%
He was also a student of Thoth.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:84%
We know him better as
Asclepius, the God of medicine,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.780 align:middle line:84%
holding his rod of
Asclepius, which

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.662 align:middle line:84%
we see as a common symbol for
medicine and healing arts.

00:07:05.662 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Asclepius was known
as a great healer.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:10%
And in fact in
mythology, where Orion

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:10%
was stung by a
scorpion at his foot,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:10%
he experienced something that
took him to the brink of death.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one would say,
and many of the stories,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:90%
that actually he died.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
But he was saved by
Asclepius and his rod,

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:84%
the Rod of Asclepius being the
same as the caduceus symbol,

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
sometimes depicted
with only one snake.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Asclepius today would be
referenced as the constellation

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Ophiuchus.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Imhotep was an initiate
of the mystery tradition,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:48.450 align:middle line:10%
especially the hermetic wisdom,
the tradition that extends all

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.090 align:middle line:10%
the way back to the Egyptian God
Thoth, which brought in alchemy,

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:10%
which brought in
study of the stars,

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:10%
which brought in understanding
of alignments with the cardinal

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:10%
directions, the magnetics,
how to harness it.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
All of this wisdoms, ancient
wisdom, both alchemical wisdom

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
as well as architectural wisdom,
was brought through that mystery

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.445 align:middle line:90%
school tradition into Imhotep.

00:08:11.445 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> All of that comes
together at Djoser's pyramid.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:84%
When you're standing
before it, on the outside,

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at the step
pyramid, the stairway to heaven.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Then when you're privileged
to go into it as we can today,

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and you drop down 90 feet down
this shaft, drilled exactly

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:84%
into the center of the pyramid,
and there you see his granite

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
sarcophagus, you
realize that you're

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a multifaceted
device or technology.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:90%
This is all working together.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And you recognize that this has
extraterrestrial connections

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:84%
This was imported to Earth, and
this is the start in the modern

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
era, just 5,700 years ago,
of the reinvigoration of this

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that came
from the stars.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Roughly 1 mile Northwest
of Djoser's pyramid,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle line:10%
a network of subterranean
chambers known as the Serapeum

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.925 align:middle line:10%
defies all understanding.

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> When we go into Saqqara in a
very unassuming staircase that

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
leads underground, what we find
is something that looks like it

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
comes from a science
fiction Hollywood movie.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
It is a high tech corridor with
a series of chambers offset

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:84%
as we walk along this highly
polished limestone and granite

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:84%
The ceilings are high, the
stonework is perfection.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:10%
>> The Serapeum are underground
galleries in Saqqara.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:10%
An underground-- I
mean, gigantic tunnels.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.570 align:middle line:84%
They are maybe a
large 2.5 meters.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And right and left
of these tunnels

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:84%
are niches, and in every
niche is a sarcophagus.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And this sarcophagus
is gigantic.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Only the lid has a
weight of 20 to 40 tons.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Only the lid.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And the sarcophagus itself
has a weight of 60 to 80 tons.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>> When we come to the
Serapeum near Saqqara,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
we find a place of
just immense mystery,

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
more than perhaps most
can even contemplate.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:10%
Discovered in 1851 by the
Frenchman Auguste Mariette,

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:10%
he was in the Cairo area looking
for early Christian manuscripts

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:10%
on behalf of the Louvre.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
He's told a legend
by the local Bedouins

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.910 align:middle line:84%
of this Avenue of
sphinxes that leads

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:90%
to this subterranean complex.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:90%
He goes over to Saqqara.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:90%
He finds the head of a Sphinx.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Then he finds
another and another.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And he follows the trail,
digs down 30, 60 feet,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:09.790 align:middle line:84%
and enters into this gallery,
where he finds these 24 granite

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:84%
boxes all lined up in a row
in individual galleries.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:84%
He sees salt calcified on
the walls as he enters,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:90%
and he's confused by all this.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
He's told the legend
that these are sarcophagi

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:90%
for the sacred Apis bulls.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And he must have had
the same reaction

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that a contemporary visitor
to the Serapeum has.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make any sense.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't add up.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
These are massive boxes that
are so perfectly constructed

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:84%
that it's a way
over the top misfit

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
to say that this is the
sarcophagi for the sacred Apis

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:90%
bull.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%
So what are these boxes?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.925 align:middle line:90%
What are these coffers?

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2001, I gained
permission from Zahi Hawass,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.160 align:middle line:10%
who was the director of the
Giza Plateau at that time.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
We went down to Saqqara
and to a mysterious place

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:90%
called the Serapeum.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:90%
I had a flashlight with me.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I had a square that was
calibrated to within 50

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
millionths of an inch,
a straight edge that was

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.270 align:middle line:84%
calibrated to within
1/10,000th of an inch,

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:90%
and it was inches long.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I went inside this one box that
had the corner blown off of it,

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and I put the square on
the underside of the lid.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Then I went to the opposite
side, did the same thing.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
With those two
photographs, what you see

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is flat surfaces,
reflection of my hand

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and the gauges with
no aberrations.

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And the condition
that exists there

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is that you have two
vertical surfaces

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
opposite each other that
are perfectly parallel.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:04.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think people really
understand what it takes to do,

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:09.160 align:middle line:84%
to perform that kind of work and
achieve those kind of results.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I have been through
the place since then

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
with engineers,
with craftspeople,

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and everybody is absolutely
blown away and amazed at it.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And they know that
these artifacts

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.325 align:middle line:84%
are a smoking gun from a
very advanced civilization.

00:13:29.325 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at
the sarcophagus,

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
what we find is that these are
not made of the red granite that

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:84%
we see in Aswan, because the
granite is made of three primary

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
minerals-- quartz,
feldspar, and mica.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
In the case of Aswan
granite, we have rose quartz

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:90%
and we have a pink feldspar.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:90%
This is not the case.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:84%
In Saqqara, what we find is
something called black granite.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is fascinating
to me because it

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
is a lower quartz,
it's only about 20%

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.500 align:middle line:84%
quartz rather than the
84% that we find in Aswan.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Lower quartz granite, high,
high percentage of biotite mica.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Geologically, what
does this tell us?

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
The mica itself, the biotite,
is a powerful insulator.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Whatever was happening
inside of that sarcophagus,

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:84%
these devices were built to
contain whatever was happening,

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to contain the energy, to
protect whatever was happening

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:84%
inside, and also to protect
whatever was happening inside

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.150 align:middle line:90%
from an external environment.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>> These structures were so
large, these granite sarcophagi,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
so large it would be impossibly
difficult to get them

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:90%
into the structure.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We also see the
remnants of what looks

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.650 align:middle line:84%
like there was a
calamity or a mistake,

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:84%
because one of the sarcophagi
was left near the entrance

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and abandoned.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's as if they took it in, or
were trying to rapidly take it

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
out right before a
cataclysm, and they just

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.650 align:middle line:84%
left it right in the
center of the entryway.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The enigma of this place
and the energy that

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:84%
comes off of these
particular sarcophagi

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:90%
is beyond description.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not stranger
than we imagined.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.865 align:middle line:84%
It's stranger, frankly,
than can be imagined.

00:15:29.865 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The question had
always been, well, why?

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing?

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.170 align:middle line:84%
What were they using
these boxes for?

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:90%
And why are they--

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:90%
why are they so precise?

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, for the expense that
it would take to create them,

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.540 align:middle line:84%
they had to be
extremely important.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Those kind of tolerances
and precisions

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
are not crafted into a
product for no reason at all.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.832 align:middle line:84%
There is a very specific
and precise reason for it.

00:16:02.832 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>> As the mysteries
mount in Saqqara,

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:84%
recent experiments raise new
questions about this region

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.130 align:middle line:90%
of the necropolis.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:10%
Inspired by Kirlian
photography, Bio-Well

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.670 align:middle line:10%
is a gas discharge
visualization device

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:10%
with a special sensor that reads
the energies of the quantum

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.660 align:middle line:10%
field and helps alternative
researchers understand

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:31.622 align:middle line:10%
how this field reacts in and
around humans and monuments.

00:16:31.622 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:10%
>> We came to Saqqara area,
and when I started doing

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:10%
measurements, I came to
understanding it is very,

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:10%
very special place.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:10%
I've done measurements
nearby Djoser pyramid,

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:10%
and we were able to come
inside Djoser pyramid,

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.500 align:middle line:10%
and then did measurements
inside as well.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:10%
Energy was very high.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:10%
Then of course,
inside Djoser pyramid,

00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:10%
you have big area, empty
area, very high and deep

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:10%
on the ground, about 40, 35, 40.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:12.400 align:middle line:10%
And there, at the bottom,
we have a huge cube.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:10%
It's not a tomb.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:10%
And you can go down there.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.829 align:middle line:10%
Energy there was very high.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:10%
So at the top, some
level of energy.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.430 align:middle line:10%
But when you go down,
it's much higher.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:10%
So it is absolutely clear
that it is something special.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:10%
And even more than that,
they have Serapeum.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:10%
They have 24 granite boxes.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:10%
Our device, we have
little Bio-Well mini.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.440 align:middle line:10%
It operates on Bluetooth
through a mobile phone

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:10%
and it works very well.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.160 align:middle line:10%
I did many, many
measurements around.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:10%
When we came to Serapeum, I
was trying to do measurements,

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:10%
impossible.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:10%
No Bluetooth signal.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.450 align:middle line:10%
So device shows it is Bluetooth
connected, on the phone,

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:10%
I don't see a connection.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:10%
So it means that it was some
electromagnetic field that

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:10%
totally suppressed this
Bluetooth connection.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:10%
We know this very
well in our technology

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:10%
because all military sites and
governmental sites, they use it.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:26.178 align:middle line:10%
Why in this underground tunnel
with these gradient boxes,

00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:27.720 align:middle line:10%
they have this
electromagnetic field?

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.990 align:middle line:10%
We think that all these
pyramids, this Serapeum,

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:10%
all these shafts, it was
the type of communication

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:10%
technology.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.470 align:middle line:10%
And it was designed to
communicate with maybe

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:10%
some other civilizations.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:50.630 align:middle line:10%
Because all this indicates
us that these pyramids

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:10%
and other subjects was
created by some high, very

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.416 align:middle line:10%
high technology.

00:18:58.416 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Millions of people visit
the step pyramid at Saqqara.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:90%
They visit the Giza Plateau.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:84%
But most don't have a
fundamental understanding

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
of what they're
looking at in terms

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
of the purpose of
these pyramids.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Nor do they appreciate what
is going on underground.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:10%
We know for an absolute
fact that 8 miles of tunnels

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:10%
fan out from the step
pyramid at Saqqara,

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.660 align:middle line:10%
from the stairway to heaven.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:90%
We have photos of the galleries.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:90%
These are all painted.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And there were
storerooms where there

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
was treasure for Djoser
and other Kings as well.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:10%
The entire Giza
plateau is believed

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.730 align:middle line:10%
to be honeycombed
with these tunnels.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.860 align:middle line:10%
We've actually found them today.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how deep they go.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:10%
In other words, how many
levels deep they go,

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:10%
or how far they fan out.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:10%
This is a closely
guarded secret in Egypt.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Even today, it's off limits
to the general public

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
because it raises
these questions.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:84%
If what we're seeing
on the surface

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
is only a fraction of what
actually the entire complex must

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:84%
have been, what
exactly is going on

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
underneath the Giza
plateau, underneath Saqqara,

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:90%
underneath Abusir?

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:84%
All these other
locations most clearly

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:90%
connect with one another.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything that we see
under Saqqara is actually part

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:90%
of the Giza Plateau.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.320 align:middle line:90%
It's about 22 miles away.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:84%
4,000 square acres is
what we're looking at.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge, it's
a massive place.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But rather than thinking of
it as separate from Giza,

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:84%
if we can think of this as a
continuous subterranean complex,

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:90%
now it begins to make sense.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:10%
From an archeological
perspective,

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.900 align:middle line:10%
it looks like we are
viewing one massive complex.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a whole connection
between these pyramids.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Some people have suggested
there's underground networks

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:90%
associated with them.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We certainly have that at the
Giza Plateau and at Saqqara,

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:10%
Some people have
suggested there's

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:10%
some kind of energy
source that's

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:10%
being manipulated along
this length of pyramids

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:10%
going all the way down
South, and the energy is then

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:10%
bought up, and the
pyramids are then

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:10%
used as these kind
of power plants,

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:10%
according to authors like
Chris Dunn and others.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:10%
And so there's something
really profound about this

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:10%
because there's even the
work of John Burke, who

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.130 align:middle line:10%
believes that they were
using certain materials

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:10%
and certain locations in the
geology and the magnetism

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.550 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth to
actually release iron

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:10%
so you have this
fertilizing presence,

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:10%
this movement across
this particular alignment

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.820 align:middle line:10%
of pyramids.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
scientifically-tested

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.352 align:middle line:84%
as well, so there's
definitely something in this.

00:21:47.352 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Nikola Tesla was very
fascinated with the ancient

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian pyramids, and he felt
that they were more than just

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
places of ceremony
or sacred burials.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:84%
He believed that these
pyramids were energy devices.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.240 align:middle line:84%
He saw the whole
Earth as a generator

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:90%
of this great magnetic field.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And the core of the Earth
was where the generator

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:90%
was, within the magma.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that
there was something

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.500 align:middle line:84%
about both the construction
of the pyramids

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and their pyramidal shape,
the triangular shape,

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.320 align:middle line:84%
creating a cone, creating a way
of directing the energy that

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
came up from the Earth,
and then amplifying it

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:84%
somehow through the, maybe
through the quartz that's

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.270 align:middle line:90%
in the stone that was used.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that you could have
wireless transmission of energy.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And this inspired
his Tesla towers.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:10%
And he made them somewhat
pyramidal in shape

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:53.660 align:middle line:10%
and felt that if we can
harness the natural energy

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:10%
between the Earth
and the ionosphere,

00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:10%
that we can generate electricity
and then wirelessly transmit it

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.071 align:middle line:10%
from one place to another place.

00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>> As the underworld of the
Memphite Necropolis is slowly

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
revealed, there is little doubt
that the pyramids along the West

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Bank of the Nile were using the
properties of specific stones

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:84%
to enhance their
function and design.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:84%
But the question remains,
was the purpose strictly

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
for energetic production?

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Or was this spiritual
transformation technology

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:34.820 align:middle line:84%
left to us from our
pre-diluvian ancestors?

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
As with most ancient mysteries
in Egypt, the search for clues

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:84%
returns to Giza, to
discover the strongest

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
evidence of ancient
energetic production.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:10%
Inspired by the work
of Nikola Tesla,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.750 align:middle line:10%
the 1998 release of
The Giza Power Plant

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:58.040 align:middle line:10%
used an engineering perspective
of the Great Pyramid of Giza

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.390 align:middle line:10%
to explain how this mysterious
monument could function

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.065 align:middle line:10%
as a free energy device.

00:24:05.065 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:10%
>> I came to the conclusion
and presented evidence that all

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:10%
the features inside the Great
Pyramid support the idea that it

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:10%
functioned as a power plant, and
it was used to draw vibrations

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:10%
from the Earth and convert those
vibrations to electromagnetic

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:10%
energy, and then convey that
energy to the outside via

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:10%
the shafts of the
king's chamber.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.890 align:middle line:10%
The most important
aspect in my new book,

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:10%
Giza: The Tesla Connection,
is the discovery

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:10%
by NASA physicist Dr.
Friedemann Freund,

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:10%
who discovered the physics
behind earthquake lights.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.050 align:middle line:10%
And the collection of
evidence that he gathered

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:10%
shows that there is a process
that happens in the lithosphere,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.460 align:middle line:10%
in the igneous rock, where
when the rock is stressed,

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:03.840 align:middle line:10%
it releases electrons
that shoot to the surface

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.230 align:middle line:10%
to the highest point in
the surrounding area.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:10%
That really expanded the
whole power plant theory,

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:15.700 align:middle line:10%
considering that the Great
Pyramid is on a high plateau,

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:10%
and it certainly is the
highest point on the surface,

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:10%
and that if you could stimulate
rocks underneath the Earth

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:10%
to release electrons,
the lithosphere is

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:10%
like a huge battery.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's like 100
kilometers thick, though.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:10%
So you have a huge
potential battery,

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:10%
where all you have to do is
shake the electrons loose

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.440 align:middle line:10%
and they will come
rushing to the surface.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:10%
So basically, my
concept, originally, it

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:10%
was a power plant,
but now I describe it

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:10%
as an electron harvester
because what you are doing

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.230 align:middle line:10%
is you're harvesting electrons
from the lithosphere.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And the other part to that
is that the stimulation

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of the release of electrons
in the lithosphere

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.670 align:middle line:84%
can't be limited to
just one pyramid.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:13.546 align:middle line:10%
So it has to serve
all the pyramids.
