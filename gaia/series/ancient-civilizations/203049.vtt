00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> The Isle of Lewis--

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
the largest island of the
Outer Hebrides archipelago

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:90%
in Scotland.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:10%
In December of 2019,
and article was

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:10%
published by the University
of St. Andrews that discovered

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:10%
an ancient secret
in one of the stone

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:10%
circles known as
Airigh na Beinne Bige.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.940 align:middle line:10%
Geophysics revealed that not
only was the stone originally

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.879 align:middle line:10%
part of a circle
of standing stones

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:10%
but also that there was a
massive, star-shaped, magnetic

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.230 align:middle line:10%
anomaly in the center,
possibly from the result

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:10%
of a large lightning strike.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But to add to the
mystery, scientists

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
stated that lightning strikes
are extremely rare in the UK

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and the association
with the stone circle

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%
is unlikely just a coincidence.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Could ancient people have
built these stone circles

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that they
could control nature?

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But what kind of power were
they trying to control?

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible they
were looking to harness

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:84%
energy or other dimensions
of consciousness?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case, could
harnessing the power of nature

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.210 align:middle line:90%
itself control time and space?

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And would this mean
godly power for humanity?

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:84%
What kind of secrets lie hidden
within these ancient stone

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.690 align:middle line:84%
circles that resonate
interdimensionally?

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
South Africa, in the
province of Mpumalanga,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is what some believe to
be one of the oldest stone

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:90%
circles in the world.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:84%
The site is called
Blaauboschkraal stone ruins.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.360 align:middle line:84%
But an archaeologist
named Michael Tellinger

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.580 align:middle line:84%
with an alternative
theory on its origin

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.520 align:middle line:90%
calls it Adam's Calendar.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Here, we start our investigation
into the unusual properties

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:90%
of these structures.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Adam's Calendar is what
I call the oldest working

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.290 align:middle line:10%
megalithic sun
calendar on Earth.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:10%
It is actually a giant
machine left behind

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.800 align:middle line:10%
by an ancient
advanced civilization.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:84%
But encoded into the machine
is actually a sun calendar,

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:84%
is a circular structure with
two big stones in the middle.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Those are the megalithic stones.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:84%
You can see them as like sort
of two metal plates vibrating

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:90%
against each other.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
It is surrounded
by standing stones.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
The entire structure
is perched on the edge

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
of a cliff a kilometer above
the Barberton impact crater,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
overlooking what are several
of the most prosperous gold

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:90%
mines in modern times.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
It is aligned to the north,
south, east, and west.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:84%
It is aligned with the
solstices and equinoxes.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is also
aligned with the rise

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:84%
of the sun across the
Horus stone statue,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
or the Horus stone
carved bird, that

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
marks the rising of
the sun that looks

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:84%
at three other stones to
the south of it that marks

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.080 align:middle line:90%
the rising of Orion's belt.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So the encoded symbology
is very similar to what

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:90%
we find further north in Egypt.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:10%
This spectacular coincidence
between Adam's Calendar,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:10%
Great Zimbabwe, and the
Great Pyramid of Giza

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.790 align:middle line:10%
is that they are all aligned
along the 31 degrees east

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:10%
longitudinal line,
which is often

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.125 align:middle line:10%
called the Nilotic Meridian.

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:19.860 align:middle line:10%


00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Adam's Calendar is a very
beautiful monument in South

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:10%
Africa.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:10%
It consists of a whole
series of recumbent stones

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:10%
in a natural position of where
they were lined originally

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:10%
by nature itself.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But some of these
stones have been

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
erected to form what we
call a stone setting.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
different claims,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
relating to the orientation
of these stones,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that they
target the rising

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.240 align:middle line:90%
and setting of specific stars.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that we
don't know when this was done.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.870 align:middle line:84%
It could have been a
few thousand years ago.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It could have been tens
of thousands of years ago.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And added to this is that
archaeologists do not

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.050 align:middle line:90%
take seriously Adam's Calendar.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So despite the enigma
surrounding it,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
there are many unanswered
questions surrounding its use

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:90%
and purpose.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the research work
that happened in 2008 pointed

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
us towards an age of
about 75,000 years.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was done by
various astronomers

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that we've asked to
help us out with this.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But even they were
wrong because they

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:84%
didn't take into
consideration the misalignment

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
with north/south at
3 and 1/4 degrees.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So something else
is going on here.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is possibly one of
the oldest stone structures

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
on Earth today, how could its
existence link to the other

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.962 align:middle line:90%
stone circles around the world?

00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:10%
>> What we're starting to
realize is that these stone

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:10%
circles are far more ancient
than we previously realized.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:10%
Take, for example,
Gobekli Tepe, which

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.770 align:middle line:10%
is at least 12,000 years old--
the stone circles at Gobekli

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.797 align:middle line:10%
Tepe, 12,000 years old.

00:06:18.797 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:84%
This is before the end
of the Younger Dryas,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:90%
the end of the last Ice Age.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.110 align:middle line:84%
This is pre-flood that
we're talking about.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So who had the knowledge
12,000 years ago

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
before there was supposed
to be civilization

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and means of humanity
to gather together

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to build such structures
to create Gobekli Tepe?

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.100 align:middle line:84%
The oldest holes at Stonehenge
we now date to 8,000 years old.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So these stone circles represent
a far more ancient and lost

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
technology and
are representative

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.530 align:middle line:90%
of a lost civilization.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Adam's Calendar, it is just
another example of ancient

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:10%
advanced technology and
knowledge of the ancient

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:10%
civilizations that we know very
little about and their capacity

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:10%
to create machines.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is what people
need to comprehend.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
these ancient sites, all

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:84%
of these ancient sites,
literally without exception,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
all of them were originally
constructed as machines.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
They are not dwellings for
people or animals or cows.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:84%
All these ancient sites--
when you look at them and you

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:84%
understand sound,
resonance, and frequency,

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:84%
you understand
cymatics, it is very,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
very obvious that all these
ancient sites have one thing

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:90%
in common--

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:84%
their original purpose
was to generate energy.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And so there's not
really a difference.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different
way or a different means

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
of construction-- having the
knowledge of sound, resonance,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and frequency, how to use
the natural frequencies

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, the
vibration of the Earth,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and turning it into
a very powerful,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.540 align:middle line:90%
energy-generating device.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If the knowledge of sound
had the power to transform

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
the currents of the Earth within
these circles, how did it work?

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Gregg Braden explains
an important finding

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:90%
at most of these sites.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at the materials
that are used to build some

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:10%
of the most sacred
sites in the world,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:10%
there's a common thread that
weaves all of these sites

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:10%
together, and that is that the
stones that are used often hold

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:10%
properties that influence the
human body in the presence

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.400 align:middle line:10%
of those properties.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:10%
One of the most prolific is
quartz and the use of quartz

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:10%
either in sandstone
or in granite.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.650 align:middle line:84%
What we see is a kind of quartz
that is called piezo quartz,

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:90%
or piezoelectric quartz.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And this quartz has
the property that,

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
when it is stressed, when
it is put under pressure,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:90%
it emits an electrical charge.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:10%
This is the kind of
quartz that is often

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:10%
used in what's called
a quartz watch.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:01.720 align:middle line:10%
So when the spring
in the quartz watch

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:10%
presses against that
little quartz crystal,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:10%
it emits enough of
electrical charge

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:10%
that it powers the watch.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:84%
This is what's used
in these sacred sites

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:84%
because there is an energy
in the pressure of the Earth

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.580 align:middle line:84%
pushing against
the quartz grains,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:84%
releasing that electrical charge
in a way that can be felt when

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.070 align:middle line:90%
a human walks into the site.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.380 align:middle line:84%
I personally-- when I
walk into these sites,

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
often the hair on my
arms will just stand up

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
or I'll get goosebumps
on the back of my neck.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've done it
so many times, I

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:90%
know now where this comes from.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So somehow our
ancestors understood

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that there were certain
stones that emitted properties

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:90%
that influenced us as people.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Today, modern
science is telling us

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
precisely how this
relationship works

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and how these properties
influence the human body

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
in ways that we're now only
beginning to understand.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Yet other researchers suggest
these circles show evidence

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:10%
of not only capturing Earth
currents but human currents.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:10%
>> There are researchers who
would claim that the strange

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.620 align:middle line:10%
acoustic properties that are
recorded in stone circles

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:10%
around the world might be able
to produce a tear, if you will,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:10%
between time periods and you
could actually travel in time.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Another way of looking at
it is through altered states

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It could very well be that,
through the acoustic patterns

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that can be used in these stone
circles, some of these shaman

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:84%
may have been able
to travel to the past

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and to the present in a
sort of astral projection

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
or a remote viewing
kind of a way.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.085 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, maybe they
did serve as time machines.

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:10%
>> So one of these
different technology used

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:10%
by the Atlantean
was based on sound.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:10%
Yes, we've been
mentioning sounds about,

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:10%
for example, the
capacity of creating

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:10%
an anti-gravity effect, a
vibration that makes literally

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.600 align:middle line:10%
every object to lose weight.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
That's also probably
the reason why

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
some of the ancient
temples, pyramids,

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:84%
obelisk of many different
civilization they've

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:84%
been probably stand
or they've been

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:84%
built, making these
gigantic piece of stones

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:90%
heavy like a little plume.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So, in this case,
this sound is being

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.930 align:middle line:84%
used in many different way
also to change, to rise,

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
or to modify the frequencies
of the planet Earth.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So this position of
these stones many times

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:84%
in circle, stones that
they bend and align

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:84%
to the movement of the
sun and the movement

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:11.660 align:middle line:84%
of different planet, stone
circle that unfortunately they

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.370 align:middle line:84%
are not be investigated
little it down below--

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
because if we're going to
excavate down these places,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:84%
probably we're going to
find some other element,

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
some other stones that they
are part of these temples.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But we can talk about
something else than temples.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We can talk literally,
again, like portals.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.390 align:middle line:84%
They've been created
as open temples,

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
if you want, as open station
to, again, travel into time,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
to travel into dimension
or to travel into space.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
That's also the reason
why they are perfectly

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:90%
aligned to specific planet.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true that
sound may help in the process

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:84%
of dimensional travel, why
was creating these structures

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:84%
in a circular formation an
important aspect of this

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:90%
ancient technology?

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When humans started to
understand how the universe

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
works, how the Earth was moving,
and how the stars were moving,

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.275 align:middle line:84%
they understood that
everything was a cycle.

00:13:22.275 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.770 align:middle line:10%
Because they had no references
in the world outside,

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:10%
they used the stars to
focus like a reference

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.030 align:middle line:10%
to travel to go along the world.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And by looking into the
movement of the stars,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
by looking into
the sun, the moon,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
watching how the main
structures that guided our life

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
were cycles, we kind
of knew that the matter

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
was a cycle, that everything
was bounded in the circle shape.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
The way we saw the
reality moving the space

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:90%
was through circles.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, by the wise people
that were watching constantly

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
the skies and seeing how
the things were changing,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:84%
they understood,
also, that the time

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
was a circle because every
year happens exactly the same.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Even if the people
were changing,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.800 align:middle line:84%
the environment was
almost the same--

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.240 align:middle line:90%
spring, summer, autumn, winter--

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
and the same stars
at every period.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of
like if they would

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
see the future by saying where
the sun would rise at each day.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:90%
So they knew how to handle time.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:90%
So it was not just about space.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.390 align:middle line:84%
They understood that the cycles
were telling us about time.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:84%
This created the idea
that the time was a circle

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and that we could move
through time as a circle,

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:84%
that there was nothing that had
happened and that will happen,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.870 align:middle line:84%
that everything is just an
echo of just one only reality.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So by doing that, by
knowing, realizing that,

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:84%
they started to build the stone
circles all over the world

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
to reach the consciousness
of space and time.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And they would balance
these stone circles

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
with the constellations that
they would follow in that

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:90%
guide them along the year.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So they could see the future
by waiting for specific dates

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.560 align:middle line:90%
for those stars.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So each stone would
represent a different aspect

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:90%
of the time, a different cycle.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is why, in
every stone circle,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:84%
the gatherings were not
only in the present,

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
but the spirits from the past
and the spirit from the future

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:90%
would guide the people.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And for us, that was the time
travel, not in a physical way,

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
but the only way that
the universe knows--

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:90%
that is, the mind.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Though some suggest the
theory of time travel within

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.520 align:middle line:84%
these ancient structures is
more a metaphorical reference,

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:84%
others posit the idea
that physically traveling

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
into another point in time
may have actually taken place.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Maria Wheatley dives
into a mysterious case

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:90%
that happened at Stonehenge.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:10%
>> If Stonehenge was
used to time travel,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:10%
then we look at the mathematical
properties of it called

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:10%
harmonics.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:10%
And a harmonic of a stone
circle is looking at, say,

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:10%
the inner feature of the stone
circle, the blue stone circle,

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.290 align:middle line:10%
to mathematically to
the outer stone circle.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And there would be
proportions in that,

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:90%
and they're the harmonics.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you have particular
mathematical harmonics,

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:84%
they generate a kind
of background resonance

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:90%
to the place.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:90%
So I think Stonehenge is unique.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
It has harmonic after
mathematical harmonic

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.330 align:middle line:84%
there compared to
other stone circles.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think, if it was being
used to interdimensionally go

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
places, then that would
be its key factor.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:90%
But more than that--

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:84%
you see, Stonehenge
is surrounded

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
by military establishment
after military establishment.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
There's 16 big army places
all around Stonehenge

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and an important nuclear
biological center to boot.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was interviewing
two army officers,

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and they said that they had
gone to Stonehenge on Track 51,

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
as it's called, to
have a few tins of beer

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:90%
and to have a few cigarettes.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:90%
And they did that.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They said that they
were completely sober.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:84%
But what they noticed
was, from Stonehenge,

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.090 align:middle line:84%
an amber light
came towards them.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're really
trained observers,

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and they were looking
to where this light was

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:90%
in comparison to the car.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And they thought, how could it
go from one point over there

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly go to
that point over there?

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And so, anyway, they
were intrigued by it

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
but didn't really think
too much about it.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.380 align:middle line:84%
They went back to
barracks, which

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:90%
is a place called Larkhill.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:84%
It's only about a mile and
a half from Stonehenge.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were instantly
arrested by the military police

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.750 align:middle line:84%
because they'd been absent
without leave for 48 hours.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So they said they'd
experienced a time loss there,

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%
and what was going on?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, where else
do we see evidence of time

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.845 align:middle line:90%
travel near these stone circles?

00:19:09.845 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone circles around the
world mark the portals that

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:84%
opened up at the beginning
of this phase of humanity.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:10%
Some stone circles were built
later as other portals opened.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:10%
But they are used not
only for ceremony.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
The people felt that energy was
coming in and also going out

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.250 align:middle line:90%
from the Earth to the cosmos.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Some stone circles actually
have both happening,

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:90%
like Stonehenge.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
The energy is leaving
the Earth, and the energy

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:90%
is coming in from the cosmos.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes
Stonehenge so powerful.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
The ancients were
obsessed with time travel

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:90%
because they knew the gods.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.080 align:middle line:90%
They experienced the demigods.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.550 align:middle line:90%
They walked amongst them.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:90%
They had interaction with them.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We've just gotten so far from
that that we don't remember

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.400 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have that
kind of experience

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:90%
in our current history.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.115 align:middle line:84%
So we have gotten
far from the gods.

00:20:21.115 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But the people
knew them, and they

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
knew that time travel and
using portals and stone circles

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and pyramids made
it all possible.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Right now,
Stonehenge, for me,

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.463 align:middle line:10%
is the pinnacle
of stone circles.

00:20:44.463 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle line:10%
There are many around the world
that have been discovered.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:10%
But Stonehenge is just
a very special place.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
outer ring of stones,

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.180 align:middle line:84%
you realize that they
actually are gongs.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you tap on
them, they resonate

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.970 align:middle line:90%
at a specific frequency.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, these frequencies
can be harnessed directly

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the stones.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, if this was replicated
right now, reproduced

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.860 align:middle line:84%
right now, you'd be able
to transmit a beam directly

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.840 align:middle line:84%
from the center point of
Stonehenge into space.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether these stone circles
were harnessing power from

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:84%
the Earth or the stars, one
thing has become clear among

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:90%
researchers.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is, time is
relative and harnessed

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:27.810 align:middle line:84%
within a stone circle using
the energy of the Earth.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Some even believe it is
an ancient battery system.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Of the amount of time I've
gone into a stone circles

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:10%
for five minutes and I come
out three hours later--

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:10%
and I don't mean that lightly.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.925 align:middle line:10%
I mean that there's a certain
displacement between the energy

00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:10%
that's outside the
circle, which, by the way,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.120 align:middle line:10%
can now be measured--

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:10%
these are experiments that have
been done in our lifetime that

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:10%
show that something
happens within the area

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:10%
around the stone circle, which
is different from the outside

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:10%
than it is on the inside,
and specifically around dawn.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not surprised
that these areas, which

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.770 align:middle line:84%
have been specifically
demarked on the land,

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
behave very differently
to the world around them.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, some of
them have been discovered

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:90%
to be geomagnetic hotspots.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you altered the
local geomagnetic field,

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
you technically altered
the effect of time

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and the perception of
time and your relationship

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:16.887 align:middle line:90%
to the physical world.

00:22:16.887 --> 00:22:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that there
is something to that

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:90%
that we're now discovering.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
There are places in
Wales, for example,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
where someone has been noting
that, when he talks to people

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and he times them going
in, when they come out,

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
they seem to be missing
40 minutes of time

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:middle line:90%
every single time.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And knowing that they all
mark the intersecting currents

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth's telluric forces
and the fact that the stones

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
themselves were specifically
chosen for the constituent

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:84%
elements of quartz and
iron and magnetite--

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
things that do influence
the human body--

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize that they
work more like accumulators.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.700 align:middle line:84%
The stone rows and
the stone circles all

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:84%
behave like batteries,
accelerators, accumulators,

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:90%
almost like a car engine.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.650 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
constituent parts.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And because of their shape,
they attract, store, and release

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.132 align:middle line:84%
the energy at certain
points in time.

00:23:10.132 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you happen to be
there at the wrong time,

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
the wrong place, if you touch
it and you ground the energy,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:84%
you'll get a hell of
an electric shock.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Stone circles were built
within landscapes that were

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:84%
ceremonial in that there were
many other different monuments

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.100 align:middle line:90%
They were the hubs of activity.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:10%
And if you like,
the energies would

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:10%
seem to have focused
around these rings of stone

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.610 align:middle line:10%
and because of which
they heightened

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:10%
not just the electromagnetic
or geomagnetic forces

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:10%
of the landscape,
but these combined

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.320 align:middle line:10%
to affect the human
mind itself to allow

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:10%
human consciousness to go into
an altered state to communicate

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:10%
with the ancestors,
the extraterrestrials,

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:10%
and the intelligences of
a multidimensional nature.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> If the intelligence of a
multidimensional nature was

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:84%
understood by the ancients, is
it possible these circles help

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.820 align:middle line:84%
restore our DNA so that we
are in harmony with our many

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:90%
existences in nature?

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:10%
>> When you go to the stone
circles, you're exposed,

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:10%
whether you like it or not,
to the natural frequencies

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth, very amplified
natural frequencies

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth that make the
trillions of cells in your body

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:10%
harmonize and
vibrate in coherent,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.650 align:middle line:10%
resonant harmony with the
frequencies of the Earth,

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.070 align:middle line:10%
which is what we
should be doing.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.112 align:middle line:90%
We should be harmonizing.

00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:45.740 align:middle line:10%
We should be in sync with
the Earth frequencies,

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:10%
not in sync and harmonizing
with the cell phone

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.840 align:middle line:10%
towers and the computers
and the cell phones and all

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.240 align:middle line:10%
the electrosmog that is
destroying our bodies

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:10%
and the cells in our bodies.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:10%
So when you're exposed
to the stone circles,

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:10%
not only do they bring into
resonant harmonic frequencies

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.060 align:middle line:10%
with the Earth, but those
frequencies heal your body,

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:10%
heal the cells, makes you whole,
and that also affects your DNA.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
That's how far we've come with
shamanic revelations and people

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
that have got the capacity
to connect to spirit,

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the ancestors,
to connect to the Anunnaki that

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:26.360 align:middle line:84%
were the architects of this
and download this information.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've identified this
and had personal experiences

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
with people experiencing
this healing on a scale

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:84%
that nobody could
have ever predicted.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So whether we like it or
not, the stone circles

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:44.930 align:middle line:84%
are playing an integral part in
the global elevation of unity

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.380 align:middle line:84%
consciousness that is
rapidly taking humanity

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to a point of no return and that
critical mass at which humanity

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
will move into a much
higher consciousness

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.015 align:middle line:84%
and we will escape this
Draconian enslavement

00:26:02.015 --> 00:26:04.760 align:middle line:84%
state of mind and state of
being that we find ourselves

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:90%
in right now.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.790 align:middle line:90%


00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these ancient stone
circles prove the existence

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of our multidimensional
nature here on Earth?

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that
ancient stone structures

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.340 align:middle line:10%
across the world may have
once harnessed powerful Earth

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:10%
energies, forming a gateway
for beings to physically travel

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:10%
through time and space?

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Were they simply
sacred sites where

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:84%
rituals took place
and traveling was

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:90%
done via one's consciousness?

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Or could there have
been yet another theory

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:84%
wherein these circular
stone formations opened

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.850 align:middle line:84%
an energetic channel through
which information could

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.950 align:middle line:90%
be sent deep into the cosmos?

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there is potential,
like some researchers

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
have suggested, that the energy
resonating within ancient stone

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
circles could be used
by modern-day people

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:06.170 align:middle line:84%
to heal and repair
our own bodies.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
If humanity were to one
day discover the answers

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to the questions that lie
buried within these magnificent

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:17.030 align:middle line:84%
structures, we may
one day reclaim

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:20.850 align:middle line:90%
a technology lost to the ages.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Could this discovery open
a new age of enlightenment

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.640 align:middle line:90%
for humankind?

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Only time will tell.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:90%
