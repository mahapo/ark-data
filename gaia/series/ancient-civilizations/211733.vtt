>> The Strait of Gibraltar,
this majestic channel connecting

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.980 align:middle line:84%
the Mediterranean Sea and the
Atlantic Ocean was a recurring

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:90%
theme in mythology.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
The ocean levels were
drastically lower,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:84%
making this waterway
a massive canyon.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And the two mountain
ranges along the sides

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
were known as the
Pillars of Hercules.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
What lies beyond
these great pillars

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
in the powerful Atlantic
Ocean has been a mystery

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:90%
in the lore and legends.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, Atalantis,
and Atlantica

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:84%
are some of the names
throughout history.

Alternative researchers search
for potential pieces and parts

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:10%
of this influential empire
all over the planet.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:90%
But what happened?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Roughly, 11,600 years ago when
this powerful ancient empire

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.586 align:middle line:90%
came to a very abrupt end.

>>GREGG BRADEN: The lost
continent of Atlantis

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:10%
has been the subject of
stories and fables and music

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:10%
throughout history.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:10%
It's deeply ingrained into
our culture and our memories

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:10%
as a tradition, but the question
is, did it really exist?

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Do we have evidence
that it existed?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And if it did, what does
it mean to us today?

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.990 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREW COLLINS:
The story of Atlantis

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:10%
is arguably the greatest of
all of the ancient mysteries.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about a
huge island continent

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:10%
somewhere out in the
Atlantic Ocean that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:10%
thrived, but then was destroyed
in one single night and day

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:10%
through earthquakes and floods.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And for hundreds of
years, we've tried

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
to find out where exactly
Atlantis is located.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.660 align:middle line:10%
And to try and find
it, was it closer

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:10%
to the pillar of Hercules?

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, just outside
of the Mediterranean.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the Canaries.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the Azores.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Or was it much further away?

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:90%
We're still looking now.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.720 align:middle line:90%
There is pieces of evidence.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:90%
There are archeological remains.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.480 align:middle line:84%
There is possibility
of the survival

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:84%
of some of the peoples of
Atlantis, both in the Americas

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and possibly even in
Europe and Africa.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's an enigma that
we have to take a hold,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
look at everything
and study everything

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.515 align:middle line:84%
almost from the point
of beginning it again.

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:16.436 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HUGH NEWMAN:
Atlantis can really

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
be seen as like a
global civilization.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:10%
And ideas were spread
around the world.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:10%
There was global communication.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:10%
There was technology.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:10%
There was megalithic
construction.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:10%
There may have even had
technology similar to us today.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But because so much
devastation took place,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
there's little evidence
apart from a few places

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.735 align:middle line:84%
that are being discovered
in relatively recent years.

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>>ERICH VON DANIKEN:
One thing is for sure,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis did exist.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:10%
There is no way out.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know where it is.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
There are different
possibilities which

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:90%
we find in the literature.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:10%
Most of it, they say it's
in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It was near the island
of Crete, sunk there.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Other says and it's even
written out of Gibraltar where

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:90%
today the Bermuda Triangle is.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:84%
There are different
possibilities.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.309 align:middle line:84%
No one knows for sure
where Atlantis was.

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout ancient Egypt,
there are many clues that point

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
to this great civilization
beyond the great pillars

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.770 align:middle line:90%
of Hercules.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Strange hieroglyphs in
Egypt in the Temple of Seti

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
in Abydos depicting what looks
to be a helicopter, plane,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:84%
submarine, and Zeppelin have
puzzled alternative researchers

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and led to speculation
that this once great

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
pre-diluvian civilization
reached the height

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:90%
of our current technology.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
The relics buried along
the Nile River bank

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.870 align:middle line:84%
likely hold many
more clues to help

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
us understand the
power and influence

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:90%
of the mighty Atlantean empire.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: When you
unpack the story of Atlantis,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.400 align:middle line:10%
you realize that it's an
Egyptian story, that it's

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptians trying to come
to terms with or understand who

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:10%
their divine ancestors were.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And you can only imagine them
around 400 BC looking around

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and seeing massive
pyramid complexes

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and asking the question, well,
where did these come from?

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, traditional
Egyptology says

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
that they were built in
2500 BC, 1,500 years or so

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:90%
before the time of Plato.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But yet, they're
writing these stories

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
telling about an advanced
civilization that existed long

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:90%
before them.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
In the Egyptian oral
tradition, Egypt

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
was originally called Kem
or Kemet, the Black land

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:90%
or even the land of gold.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the stories,
they're always

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.750 align:middle line:84%
referring to divine ancestors
that originally founded Egypt.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And by extension,
we're asked to believe

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that these divine ancestors
were perhaps the Atlanteans

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
and that they were the ones
that were responsible for all

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
these incredible temples
and much of the technology

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that they were seeing
in ancient Egypt.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:10%
>>MATTHEW LACROIX: One of
the legendary Egyptian gods

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:10%
and scribes known as Thoth
left behind his own set

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:10%
of ancient records known as
the Emerald Tablets of Thoth

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:10%
in which he describes seeing
the entire story and the legacy

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:10%
of Atlantis from its primitive
origins of purity of knowledge

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:10%
to eventually becoming corrupted
by war and empire building.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth describes how
the survivors of Atlantis

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:84%
were who came to Egypt to
create the ancient Egyptian

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.060 align:middle line:90%
civilization known as Kemet.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Thoth describes how the
technology and knowledge

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.790 align:middle line:84%
from Atlantis was
passed to Egypt.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It was there that
he describes how

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
there was a great hall
known as the Halls of Amenti

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:90%
where they had a great library.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Contained within this
library was all the knowledge

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:90%
of the past including Atlantis.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:10%
>>MARIA WHEATLEY: The connection
between Egypt and Atlantis,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:10%
I think is cultural.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we've
got mummification.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
We've got the extended skulls,
the cranial deformation,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and also, we've got
the practice of magic

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:90%
with the Book of the Dead.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:90%
And we've got pyramid building.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So where did all
of this come from?

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Did it just arise
overnight in ancient Egypt,

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:84%
or was it the
legacy of Atlantis?

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:10%
So I think the links are
throughout the culture

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.260 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Egypt, not just
in the monumental building,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:10%
but in its culture and identity.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a direct
fallout of Atlantis.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Historical legends
states that around 450 BCE,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Athenian statesman
and poet, Solon,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
traveled from Greece to the
Nile and began studying the ways

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:90%
of ancient Egypt.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:84%
In a temple in the
ancient city of Sais,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
there was an elder
priest named Sonchis

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that told him of the
tales of Egypt's ancestors

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:90%
from a lost civilization.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.760 align:middle line:84%
When Solon returned to Greece,
the legend began growing.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis was
eventually woven into books

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:25.065 align:middle line:84%
by the philosopher Plato through
his works Timaeus and Critias.

00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:28.296 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: In a way,
these dialogues are sort of

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:90%
like Plato's family story.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a story that
was passed along

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.409 align:middle line:84%
from his ancestor Solon, who 150
years before the time of Plato

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.100 align:middle line:90%
had traveled to Egypt.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:10%
He was told by the priests
there the point of origin

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:10%
of the divine ancestors
of the Egyptians

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:10%
was this island civilization
called Atlantis that

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:10%
was said to have been located
beyond the Pillars of Hercules

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:10%
out in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.410 align:middle line:10%
No one at this time, save for
maybe the Egyptian king's list

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:10%
or others, were talking
about civilizations

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.965 align:middle line:10%
many, many thousands of
years before Plato's time.

00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT M. SCHOCH: What
is most interesting to me

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
is Plato's dating of
the end of Atlantis.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:84%
He says it's about 9,000
years before Solon, which

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:84%
puts us at about approximately
9600 BCE based on our calendar.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:10%
So I think that helps confirm
that these traditions were

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:10%
based on reality,
that there really

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:10%
was this early cycle
of civilization.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Now, we have to ask
or we have to consider

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:10%
what happened to
people between the end

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:10%
of that cycle of civilization
and the reemergence

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:10%
of civilization?

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.200 align:middle line:10%
>>JAHANNAH JAMES:
The idea in the story

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:10%
of a civilization that
disappear in a deluge

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:10%
or an island that sinks
under the sea, that

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:10%
turns up a lot in
India, in Ireland,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:10%
in North and South America.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I think that there is lots
of evidence of the story.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Annoyingly, we can't
even verify Plato's texts

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
because the Temple
of Seti, which

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.180 align:middle line:84%
is where the original text
was copied from and recorded

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:84%
by the ancient Egyptians,
that's fallen into the delta.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't
even go there now.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I wish we could because
then we could probably

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.250 align:middle line:84%
verify the story or the basis
of the story from there.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So at the minute, we just
have to trust the text,

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.490 align:middle line:84%
and we just have to go
from what Plato says.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And what we can do is
we can source around.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And we can see what's verifiable
from a scientific point of view

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
from the geology
and the geography.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And we can put it up against
all the other ancient lore

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.520 align:middle line:90%
and see what's similar.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
create a picture.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It tells a very specific story.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Plato was--

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:90%
he was a cunning guy.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't take
everything at face value

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
because what was
happening here at the time

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:84%
is that the Greek culture
is in its ascendancy.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're borrowing
things willy-nilly

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
from the Egyptians,
which we know.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:10%
And they're also
borrowing a lot of ideas

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:10%
from the Indus culture
and the Indian culture.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:10%
And we know that because their
main god, Zeus, for example,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:10%
was a corruption of
the word dyeus, which

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:10%
is one of the main gods
in the Indian pantheon.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Part of what Plato
was doing in order

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:84%
to give the Greek civilization
a perfect foundation from which

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to start democracy, he starts
getting the ideas from Solon

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:90%
of a perfect society.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW COLLINS: Skeptics
who look at the Atlantis story

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and say it can't possibly
exist because Solon could not

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
have seen accounts of the
destruction of a continent

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, for instance,
are totally wrong.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Every Egyptian temple would
have on their walls what

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:90%
were known as foundation texts.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And these start with creation
literally and then move

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:84%
forward the construction
of the first enclosure,

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.140 align:middle line:84%
the first temple, the first
city, et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:10%
And the fullest
remaining account

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:10%
of the foundation
text in Egypt is

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:10%
at a place called Edfu
in the southern part

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:10%
of the country huge,
great temple complex.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And on the walls there, it talks
about just such a cataclysm.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And what it says
is that there was

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:84%
this island called
the Island of Creation

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.540 align:middle line:90%
or the Island of the Egg.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And that on here, the earliest
beings to inhabit the world

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
created an enclosure,
the first temple.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, there
was-- something bad happened,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.190 align:middle line:84%
what they refer to as
an enemy snake suddenly

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:90%
appears in the sky.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
period of darkness.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the waters
rise up and cover over

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:56.130 align:middle line:84%
this primeval island,
destroying not just the temple

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.045 align:middle line:90%
but all of the inhabitants.

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MATTHEW LACROIX: When
people hear about Atlantis,

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:84%
many are familiar with
Plato and the work

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that he had connected to
the Timaeus and Critias

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:90%
and descriptions left behind.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:10%
But many aren't aware that there
were other Greek philosophers

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:10%
that knew incredible details
of Atlantis such as Diodorus.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, the reason why there
are other individuals that

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:10%
knew this information
was that Plato was not

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:10%
the one who was told this from
the temple priests of Sais.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Solon actually told
Socrates as well as

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
other Greek
philosophers, which is

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
why the story has to come
from multiple people,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:90%
and not one single source.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
When we combine the
information from Diodorus

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:84%
along with Plato, what we
have is a cohesive narrative

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that connects with a
very specific time period

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.400 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis was
described as being

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:90%
destroyed 11,600 years ago.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, that time period
matches up not only

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:84%
when Plato was alive and
existed telling his story,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:84%
but matches up with
ice core samples

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and geologic evidence
from the Atlantic Ocean

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.960 align:middle line:84%
basin of the mid-Atlantic
ridge that if we compare

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.880 align:middle line:84%
ancient records,
show us that there

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:84%
were incredible catastrophes
going on at this exact time

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.300 align:middle line:84%
period that's described
by Plato and Diodorus

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:84%
for the destruction
of Atlantis, matching

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
both the descriptions
of its location

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.800 align:middle line:84%
as well as the time
period that was causing

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.320 align:middle line:84%
widespread destruction
all across the Earth

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.355 align:middle line:90%
more than 11,000 years ago.

00:14:22.355 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLIAM HENRY: In
their descriptions,

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Plato and Diodorus are emphatic
that Atlantis was originally

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.610 align:middle line:84%
a very pious or
righteous civilization.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The emphasis was on their
connection with the gods,

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
that the Atlanteans
themselves were

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:90%
considered to be hybrid beings.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They were part
human, part divine.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.070 align:middle line:90%
They were demigods.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And they had been warned,
especially by Zeus

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that as long as they adhered
to their spiritual beliefs

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and maintained their
piousness and righteousness,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
that everything was going
to be fine with Atlantis.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:84%
But of course, as
Plato tells the story,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:90%
they wavered from that.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantis then
begins this long decline

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.810 align:middle line:84%
into darkness that culminates
with the total destruction

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.705 align:middle line:84%
of their civilization in a
single day and a single night.

00:15:07.705 --> 00:15:10.295 align:middle line:90%


00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Tales of Atlantis were
prevalent in ancient Greece.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But as with any civilization
that is destroyed by cataclysm,

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.790 align:middle line:84%
the evidence to prove
the exact location

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.892 align:middle line:90%
has been much harder to find.

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW COLLINS: Plato tells us
that the main island was closer

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
to the actual opposite continent
that he refers to, which I

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:90%
would take to be the Americas.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And all the indications are
that it was some distance out.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And we can say this
because he says

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that where the sunken
land of Atlantis was now

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:53.450 align:middle line:84%
these mud shoals in other
words, very shallow areas of sea

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that a vessel could very easily
get grounded on this mud.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, various other ancient
writers contemporary to Plato

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:84%
also talk about
these mud shoals.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And they add something
very vital about them,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's the fact
that this area was also

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:90%
covered in seaweed.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And this tells us that we
are dealing with the Sargasso

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Sea, a massive area
between the Azores

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and the Bahamas quite
literally covered in seaweed.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.130 align:middle line:10%
>>JAHANNAH JAMES: When I
started to research Atlantis,

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:10%
and I started looking at it
from a scientific point of view,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:10%
the geography and the
geology and saying, OK,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:10%
is it plausible
what Plato recorded?

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.093 align:middle line:84%
And when you look especially
into the mid-Atlantic and all

00:16:44.093 --> 00:16:46.260 align:middle line:84%
of the geology and everything
that's going on there,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:90%
it is actually plausible.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not impossible.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.428 align:middle line:84%
It was claimed in
like the 1960s.

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They sort of did a scan
of the ocean floor,

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and they said no, there's
no lost continent there.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And so people kind of
took that and went,

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, and they started looking for
Atlantis in other places, which

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.917 align:middle line:84%
then made the whole Atlantis
search kind of a joke

00:17:04.917 --> 00:17:06.750 align:middle line:84%
because you could go,
oh, maybe it was here.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.833 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was in Australia.

00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was in Antarctica.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.339 align:middle line:84%
And people stopped looking
in the original place

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:12.490 align:middle line:90%
that Plato said it was.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But if we refocus back
to that whole area

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and look at what went
down, it turns out

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:84%
that yes, the middle
of the Atlantic ridge

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:90%
is an extremely volatile area.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
It's on this sort of
trifecta of three plates.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.780 align:middle line:84%
They all meet right
at the Azores.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It's this incredibly
delicate place.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And if any natural
global catastrophe

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:84%
was going to happen,
I would not want

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.440 align:middle line:84%
to be there because
it's the place

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.721 align:middle line:84%
that if any island was going
to sink, it would be there.

00:17:42.721 --> 00:17:48.070 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1882, American Congressman
and writer, Ignatius L.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Donnelly, published
the book Atlantis,

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
The Antediluvian World in which
he presented evidence to show

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
that a sophisticated
civilization known as Atlantis

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
had once existed and was
destroyed from the same event

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible known
as the Great Flood.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
He based this theory on
both Plato's descriptions

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.390 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis and the
date of its destruction.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:10%
>>RANDALL CARLSON: Ignatius
Donnelly was a Congressman from

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.490 align:middle line:10%
Minnesota who ran for
Congress as much--

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:23.770 align:middle line:10%
with the motive in mind
that he could get access

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:10%
to the Library of Congress.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And he spent a lot of his
time researching Atlantis.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:10%
>>HUGH NEWMAN: And he
actually wrote a book

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:10%
where he puts lots of ideas
into it, lots of speculation

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:10%
about what Atlantis
really was, how

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.070 align:middle line:10%
it influenced the world,
what these people were doing

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:10%
at this time, what
technologies they had,

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.120 align:middle line:10%
and how it even
influenced other cultures

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.732 align:middle line:10%
like Egypt and Mexico and
other places around the world.

00:18:48.732 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JAHANNAH JAMES:
Ignatius Donnelly

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is really important to the
whole modern story of Atlantis.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.200 align:middle line:10%
So he wrote this book basically
theorizing that Plato,

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:10%
he was actually talking
about something real.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't made up and fiction.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.498 align:middle line:84%
And that really took off,
and everybody suddenly

00:19:06.498 --> 00:19:08.040 align:middle line:84%
started to get
interested in Atlantis

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly started
looking for Atlantis.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:10%
And it became really
fashionable to look for Atlantis

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.633 align:middle line:10%
from the 1880s onwards.

00:19:13.633 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:10%
>>HUGH NEWMAN: And
his ideas have really

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:10%
kind of stuck in the
consciousness of many people.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people go
along with what he said

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:84%
as well as what Plato said
and other early writers.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the fact that
Atlantis was a genuine land

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:84%
mass that got destroyed
in the cataclysm

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.085 align:middle line:84%
and sunk beneath
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:19:33.085 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>RANDALL CARLSON: But
now, Ignatius Donnelly

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.440 align:middle line:84%
saw that there was evidence
for great catastrophes

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.330 align:middle line:90%
during that epoch.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And his trigger for
these catastrophes

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:90%
was a comet impact.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.745 align:middle line:84%
So in that respect, I think
he was way ahead of his time.

00:19:50.745 --> 00:19:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JAHANNAH JAMES:
And some people

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:84%
say that Ignatius Donnelly
was like the godfather

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:90%
of alternative history.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.945 align:middle line:84%
He's the first one that
really started the, wait,

00:19:58.945 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:84%
maybe we could look at something
through a different lens

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
or maybe these myths and
legends and laws have

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:90%
some kernel of truth in them.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's look for it.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:10%
>> As the prophetic tales of
this once great civilization

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.920 align:middle line:10%
were woven through
lore and legend,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.280 align:middle line:10%
alternative researchers
were ignited by the wisdom

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.480 align:middle line:10%
and accuracy of the dating,
given by the Sleeping Prophet,

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce when a compilation
of excerpts from his earlier

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:10%
readings called Edgar Cayce on
Atlantis was published in 1968.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANDREW COLLINS: Edgar Cayce is
arguably America's most famous

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:90%
psychic.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:10%
He was known as the
Sleeping Prophet.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:10%
As these readings
were taking place,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:10%
he would often see past lives of
this particular person standing

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:10%
or sitting in front of them.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:10%
And this could
include information

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:10%
about lives in Atlantis.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:10%
He was able to flesh out areas
that Plato had never got to.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:10%
He talked in terms
of their technology,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:10%
for instance, crystal technology
and the different experiments

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:10%
they were doing, the
different temples

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:10%
that they were constructing
for energy healing.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But he also then talks about
the destruction of Atlantis.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.320 align:middle line:10%
He said it took place
over a period of time

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:30.790 align:middle line:10%
beginning around 50,000 years
ago and ending around 10500 BC.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's slightly earlier
than Plato's 9600 BC,

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.320 align:middle line:84%
but in the same
ballpark essentially.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And what he said was that
the final remnant of Atlantis

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:84%
was in the area of the
Bahamas and the Caribbean.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And that this is where we should
look for any evidence of it

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:90%
rising again quite literally.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look for this in
1968 or 1969, not too far away,

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:90%
which it wasn't.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It was just a couple
of decades away.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, what happened
at this very time 1968,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.970 align:middle line:84%
1969 was the discovery of
this incredible archeological

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:84%
feature off of the coast of
north island in the Islands

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:90%
of Bimini in the Bahamas.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>>HUGH NEWMAN: Edgar
Cayce said of Atlantis,

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:84%
it stretched all the
way virtually to Europe.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And he actually said
Bimini was an area where

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:84%
it was like the mountaintop
area which was still

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:90%
now above the water level.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And since then,
the Bimini road has

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:84%
been found, these huge
underwater megalithic pavements

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
or roads going throughout
the whole area there.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And so his predictions
came true in that respect.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:84%
He also said the Hall of Records
was originally in Atlantis,

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:84%
ended up in places like
Egypt, the Bahamas,

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:84%
in the Yucatan of Mexico,
and so on and so forth.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things he did say is

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that it was destroyed,
the final destruction

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.710 align:middle line:90%
at least in around 10000 BC.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, it had been around for
thousands of years before that.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Other cataclysms had
happened going back

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
potentially to 50,000 years,
but the final destruction

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
where it fully went under the
water was around 10,000 BC.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.040 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
about that, that

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.490 align:middle line:84%
coincides with the
Younger Dryas impact

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.900 align:middle line:84%
event within a couple
of hundred years.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:84%
So he had some inkling,
even though this

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:84%
wasn't known about
when Cayce was around,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.900 align:middle line:84%
that a cataclysm had
actually taken place.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And he repeated
that in his readings

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.640 align:middle line:84%
over and over again
throughout the years,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
which really began
in 1923 when he

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:84%
got the first piece of
information coming down to him

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.400 align:middle line:90%
about Atlantis.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.905 align:middle line:10%
>>MARIA WHEATLEY: I think if
we take Cayce's understanding

00:23:54.905 --> 00:23:59.090 align:middle line:10%
of it, it was sophisticated,
you had crystal technology,

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.670 align:middle line:10%
and kind of combined
that to Plato,

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.055 align:middle line:10%
then I think we can
ground his reality.

00:24:04.055 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.710 align:middle line:84%
>> As alternative researchers
pieced together the story

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis through
philosophers and mystics,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
it is apparent that little of
this once vast empire has been

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Among the most tangible clues
from Plato's works on Atlantis

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:84%
is his description of a
circular city structure

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:90%
and massive canal system.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:10%
Areas such as
Mauritania in Africa

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:10%
share similar features
to Plato's circular city

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:43.760 align:middle line:10%
description, but one continuous
theme around Atlantis

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.370 align:middle line:10%
is that it was
swallowed by the sea.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.652 align:middle line:90%


00:24:50.652 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL JAYE: Plato has a
description of the canals.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:10%
That canal system, we
can see on a normal map.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
You can go to the west southwest
of the Strait of Gibraltar.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:05.850 align:middle line:84%
You can look down
there, and you can

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.100 align:middle line:84%
see the series of
interconnected canals that

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.720 align:middle line:90%
match Plato's description.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.950 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
meant to do, they

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:84%
were built to take water
from the mid-Atlantic ridge.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So it must have been a
nice spring that fed down.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And by creating canals,
they increased stream front

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.800 align:middle line:90%
property, right?

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:10%
So it increased clan
access to fresh water.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:10%
The canals were adapted to
the pre-flood ecosystem.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:90%
It was warm down there.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:35.340 align:middle line:90%
The food was abundant.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And the members of this
clan built these canals

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:84%
to increase access to make
it more livable to increase,

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:84%
if you will, the
size of their clan.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:84%
That was the purpose
of the canals.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MARIA WHEATLEY:
So what I see is

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:84%
the ancient people of Atlantis,
they knew about technology.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.050 align:middle line:10%
When we look at
the circular city,

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.170 align:middle line:10%
the metropolis described
by Plato himself

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.150 align:middle line:10%
as being three circuits.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.370 align:middle line:10%
Why three circuits?

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:10%
When we look at
esoteric water divining,

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:10%
you have the strongest
energy pattern

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:10%
is three concentric circles.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And those three concentric
circles, I believe and suggest

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:84%
is why there are three
concentric islands

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
of the metropolis
described by Plato.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking beyond
Plato and thinking,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.830 align:middle line:84%
what is the design canon
that lies beneath Atlantis?

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's Earth energy,
and the power of Gaia

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
harnessed, not just in the
layout of the circular cities,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:90%
but in agriculture itself?

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.125 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:50.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Was the area we now call
the Atlantic Ocean mostly land

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:56.470 align:middle line:10%
roughly 12,800 to
12,900 years ago?

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
How low was the
Mediterranean Sea?

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And how mighty did
the Atlantean empire

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
become before the devastating
events began the Younger Dryas

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:90%
period?

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:10%
What happened roughly
11,600 years ago

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:10%
to cause the flooding
and destruction

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:21.750 align:middle line:10%
of this great empire and the
end of the Younger Dryas?

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:10%
As alternative researchers
examine the scientific evidence

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.160 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Earth
catastrophes, what

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:10%
other relics from the
ancient Atlantean empire

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.810 align:middle line:10%
lay below the surface beyond
the Pillars of Hercules

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:10%
in the mighty Atlantic Ocean?

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:90%
