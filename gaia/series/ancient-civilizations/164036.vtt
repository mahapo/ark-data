00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2015, astrophysicists
Duncan Lorimer and Maura

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:84%
McLaughlin stumbled upon a
strangely flickering star.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Its radiation pulsed
so brightly they

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:84%
were unable to match it to any
known object in the universe.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:84%
As the story made the headlines,
scientists around the world

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:90%
were baffled.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.320 align:middle line:10%
Then astronomers at the
Green Bank Telescope

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:10%
confirmed that
these light signals

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:10%
were emanating from a star
in the Cygnus Constellation,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:10%
1,200 light years away.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
This fluctuating star
was cataloged KIC8462852

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and named Tabby's Star in
honor of Tabatha Suzanne

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Boyajian, the first
astronomer who wrote about it.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Amongst the 100,000 stars
that was dipping its light,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:10%
or flux, as they call
it, periodically--

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:10%
now, this something which
happens if a planet moves

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.750 align:middle line:10%
in front of a star.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:84%
You get a very slight dip
in the amount of light

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.970 align:middle line:90%
that's reaching us.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the dips
were anything up to 22%.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I can put
this into perspective,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.870 align:middle line:10%
if, let's say,
Jupiter, the largest

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:10%
planet in our solar system,
crosses in front of the sun,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:10%
if you were looking
at it from afar,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:10%
it would dip the
light only about 1%.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:10%
So something that was dipping
the light anything up to 22%

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:10%
is going to be huge,
massive, something

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:10%
that is totally different,
something that we've not

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.280 align:middle line:10%
encountered before in astronomy.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:90%
So what was going on?

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Since 2015, the answer
to this question

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
has garnered the attention
of astronomers, scientists,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:90%
and space enthusiasts alike.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And a myriad of explanations
have been offered.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:10%
But none have been conclusive.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:10%
What is really odd about
this mystery is that,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:10%
uncharacteristically, even
the most staunch scientists

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:10%
have not discounted
a popular hypothesis

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:10%
that the expansive object
interrupting Tabby's Star's

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle line:10%
brightness could be built
by an advanced space-faring

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.210 align:middle line:10%
civilization.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:10%
Astoundingly, the BBC have
even released a documentary

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:10%
advocating this theory.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:10%
Could it hen be true?

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Then in 2016, a new
burst was detected.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:10%
The distinctive
pulse of radio waves

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:10%
released as the neutron stars
collided and were destroyed,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:10%
followed by nothing, silence.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The BBC have shown, for
the first time, a documentary,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.080 align:middle line:84%
not just about this star,
but the fact that it almost

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:84%
certainly has an ET vessel,
alien mega-structure,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
We're not just talking
about bacteria.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about advanced
civilizations, thousands

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
of years more advanced
than us down here on Earth.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
The question comes is
that, if there really

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.330 align:middle line:84%
is a structure around this
star, how does it affect us down

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is it possible
that these aliens

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
have been in touch with us in
some way in the recent past,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps even in
the distant past?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And the question comes
down to communication.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
The star is approximately
1,300 light years

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:90%
from our solar system.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Which means that, when
we're looking towards it,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
anything we say happened
1,300 years ago.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's around 700 AD.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Maya civilization
was still in full flight.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
When they look at
us, of course, they

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:84%
are also looking at that same
time frame, around 700 AD.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Linda Moulton Howe's
theory suggests that the Mayan

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
civilization was created in
a hybridized program and then

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
simply disappeared,
possibly off planet.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, this
connects to the same time

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:90%
frame with the Tabby's Star.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Could there be an
ancient civilization

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that once lived on Earth
trying to connect with us?

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I will be sought out by
some people who have worked

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:90%
for the CIA, NSA, DIA.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:84%
There was a man who
had said that he

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
had worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:10%
And he said that was the
Mayan civilization created

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.720 align:middle line:10%
in a hybridized
program, that there

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.950 align:middle line:10%
was a collaboration,
teaching, that all

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:10%
of the mathematical
skills from history.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Then in 850 AD,
it wasn't drought.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't human war.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
This man said to me,
for reasons unknown,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:90%
the EBENs came in 850 AD.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And they took the majority
of their hybridized Mayans

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.790 align:middle line:90%
in a large craft and left earth.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Mayan disappearance
and the Tabby's Star anomaly be

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:90%
linked?

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Or could this mystery
in the sky actually

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
have a more ancient connection,
an ancient connection

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:84%
that some believe taps into
the codes of our planet?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Those astronomers, they
also said that these dips

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.890 align:middle line:10%
in the light could also be
used to broadcast information,

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:10%
whether this
information be binary,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:10%
whether it be prime
numbers, or some other form

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:10%
of attention-seeking information
which a species like ourself,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:10%
humanity, could
recognize as intelligent,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:10%
as universal information.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The work that I'm carrying
out suggests that there is

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
intelligence in the broadcasts,
and that it may well be that it

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
is giving us, not just
prime numbers, or binary,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:84%
but a very specific
mathematical formula.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:10%
What I have determined
is that there

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:10%
are certain cycles associated
with the Kepler data.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:10%
They are all interlinked.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:10%
And they all reflect
certain key numbers.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:90%
All of them are multiples of 11.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, this might be just a very
simple piece of information.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
But what's so
interesting is that we

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
find that this is
associated with the most

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
complex mathematical formula
that we have down here

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:10%
For instance, Pascal's Triangle
is made up of multiples of 11.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:10%
It's like a pyramid of
numbers, the first number being

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:10%
1, the second number being 11,
the third number being 121,

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:03.640 align:middle line:10%
the fourth number being
1331, 11 squared, 11 cubed,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.600 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
These are exactly
the same numbers

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that are being broadcast
from the KIC star right

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.825 align:middle line:90%
at this moment.

00:08:13.825 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
This is where it gets weird.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the Great
Pyramid is obviously

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest enigmas
of the ancient world.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Certain researchers,
colleagues, have found within it

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
certain key numbers that keep
cropping up again and again.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And that, those numbers,
are the exact numbers

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
that are being broadcast
by this star KIC 8462852.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:10%
Is this a coincidence?

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:10%
The Great Pyramid
and its two neighbors

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:10%
are aligned to exactly the
same constellation as where

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:10%
this star is, which is Cygnus.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, just
1,000 miles northeast,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:84%
another megalithic site that
is much older also points

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:90%
to the Cygnus constellation.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the largest
and oldest megalithic site

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.020 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, Gobekli Tepe.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it also a coincidence
that the oldest complex of stone

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:10%
monuments in the world at
Gobekli Tepe in southeast

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:10%
Turkey is also aligned to
the constellation of Cygnus?

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.170 align:middle line:10%
Is it also a coincidence that
in some of the oldest cave

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:10%
art around the world,
we find evidence

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:10%
of this same constellation
represented by celestial birds,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:10%
by bird men, birds on poles,
that are pointed and directed

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:10%
towards this constellation?

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I wish we could get into
the minds and into the heads

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
of the people who
made these sites.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:10%
All over the world, in
megalithic structures,

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.200 align:middle line:10%
they're all concerned
with lining themselves up

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:10%
to the rising point of the sun
at certain times of the year.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.860 align:middle line:84%
They're telling us something
about our connection

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:84%
to the cosmos and
our place on Earth.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Could Gobekli Tepe, the
oldest megalithic structure

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, be revealing a
code that would connect us not

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:10%
only to this anomaly in the sky,
but also to other ancient sites

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.880 align:middle line:10%
around the world?

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Translated into
English, "Gobekli Tepe"

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:90%
means "potbellied hill."

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.780 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, Klaus Schmidt, an
archaeologist from Germany,

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:84%
began digging into this
unnatural-looking bluff.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:84%
A few feet below the surface,
he discovered stone ruins.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Further investigation revealed
that this ancient formation

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
in southern Turkey was 7,000
years older than Stonehenge,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:84%
throwing into
question much of what

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
has been written in
the history books.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Klaus Schmidt dedicated
his life's work

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to uncovering what might
lie below the surface

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and continued to excavate
until he-- mysteriously--

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:90%
died in 2014.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
95% of the ruins
are still buried.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And the true purpose
of Gobekli Tepe

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and its relationship
to the galaxy

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
is still an unsolved mystery.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Most archaeologists believe
the site is about 13,000 years

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:10%
old.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.520 align:middle line:10%
And they believe it existed
for a couple of thousand years

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.150 align:middle line:10%
and then it was
deliberately buried.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as I'm concerned,
it could date back much further

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Because there is evidence
in Turkey that humans like

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:54.250 align:middle line:84%
us existed millions
of years ago.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Gregg Braden points out
that more evidence is being

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:84%
uncovered pushing back
the date of antiquity.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Could Gobekli Tepe
be even older?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the consequences of
global warming is that the ice

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.460 align:middle line:84%
on the poles has
receded tremendously,

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:90%
including Antarctica.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And the thickness of
the ice as it is reduced

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
allows greater visibility
from earth-penetrating radar.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So we can see what's
underneath the ice.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:10%
But one of the surprises is
that the satellite images are

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:10%
sending back now
would appear to be

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.210 align:middle line:10%
large-scale, complex
archaeological sites.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So they're not small hunting
villages and pit houses.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:84%
These look like advanced
technological civilizations

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
underneath the ice.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So as a scientist, I have to
say one of two things happened.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Either someone built
these complex structures

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
under the ice after it already
formed, which is less likely.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And the more likely scenario
is that the structures existed.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And then the ice covered them.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Right now,
civilization, the date

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:84%
is being pushed back
to 13,500 years.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
The last ice age ended
12,000 years ago.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.280 align:middle line:84%
The historic context of
civilizations going back

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.440 align:middle line:84%
50,000, 60,000, 70,000 years
along these 5,000-year cycles

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:90%
shows up in the mythology.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the mythology is
based on much more fact

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
than we've been led
to believe in the past

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
or that we've been willing
to embrace in the past.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>> If, indeed, it could be
older than mainstream scientists

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:84%
believe, then what
could be its purpose?

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Gobekli Tepe is the
oldest stone-circle complex

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:84%
If you can imagine
Stonehenge in England

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and transpose it onto the top
of a mountain top in southeast

00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Turkey, and then multiply
it by at least 20 times,

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and then cover the stones with
beautiful carvings of animals,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and representations
of abstract humans,

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:84%
then give them t-shaped
tops, because that's

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
what the time the stones have
there, this is what Gobekli is.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
It was constructed at the
very end of the last ice age,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
around 9,500 BC, and
was in use for a period

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
of around 1,500 years before it
was abandoned about 8,000 BC.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
What's so interesting is
that the oldest and the most

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:84%
accomplished
technologically-advanced stone

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
enclosures, and that alone gives
us evidence of possibly a lost

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that Gobekli Tepe
is in northern Mesopotamia,

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
the area around Urfa, and
Harran, and Gobekli Tepe.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
This is clearly the
cradle of civilization.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
This is where the Annunaki
had their power base.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I am on a trip with
geologist Robert Schoch,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
who had had his PhD
in Yale University.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:10%
And we are standing down
inside of the excavation

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:10%
at Gobekli Tepe, surrounded by
these 19-foot-tall limestone

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:10%
pillars.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Each weighed up to 15 tons.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:90%
And they are in rings.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And in that process of standing
there and talking about

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:90%
this is the most baffling place.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel like anything
that humans can understand.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch said,
you know, I've

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:84%
been staring at
these T structures,

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about the
old past, and what could

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:90%
this have been built for.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said all of these
limestone pillars have T tops.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said it reminds
me of tuning forks.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
Linda, when you stand up

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:06.120 align:middle line:84%
at the top of the hill, and
you realize that Gobekli Tepe

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:90%
was built in a bowl.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
You're always looking down at
the top of these big T pillars

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.980 align:middle line:90%
unless you climb down into--

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.080 align:middle line:90%
and then you're among them.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what
is this whole place

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:84%
was built to resonate
with certain frequencies

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
by something above, resonating
frequencies on big pillars

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.380 align:middle line:90%
put it rings?

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:10%
>> When you look
at go Gobekli Tepe,

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:10%
and you see all of
the constructions of--

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.050 align:middle line:10%
the inscriptions of
all of the animals

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:10%
of the Earth on
these giant pillars,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.340 align:middle line:10%
it's always been interesting
to me that, perhaps, what

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:10%
these things were were
a way of recording

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.020 align:middle line:10%
the standing-wave pattern
of a certain kind of a form.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a crocodile exists
on a different standing wave

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
pattern than a crane, then
an elephant, than a monkey.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps what they
were trying to do

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.057 align:middle line:84%
was, out of a state
of preservation,

00:17:11.057 --> 00:17:12.390 align:middle line:90%
trying to preserve these things.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
They were trying
to preserve stones

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.490 align:middle line:84%
that actually had those
frequencies recorded into them.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Could Gobekli Tepe have been
an ancient portal constructed

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with gods
in faraway galaxies?

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
Tabby's Star could

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
be a signal for humans to pay
attention to this gateway?

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There is, for example,
evidence of very, very,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
very clear, very precise
astronomy at Gobekli Tepe.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
It contains, amongst
other things,

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
the world's first perfectly
north-south aligned building.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:84%
They can't do that
without astronomy.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:53.720 align:middle line:84%
There are alignments to specific
star groups at specific moments

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.410 align:middle line:90%
of the year.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a highly-evolved site.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Shamanic cultures right
the way across the Eurasian

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:08.450 align:middle line:10%
continent saw the northern
celestial pole as the point

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:10%
of exit from the physical
world and the point of entry

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:10%
into the sky world.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was seen as a hole,
quite literally a hole,

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.050 align:middle line:84%
connecting the different
universes, the middle world

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:90%
to the upper world.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:10%
It would seem as if this
stone is a sign board showing

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:10%
that journey, and the actual
course, the route, that you

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:10%
would take to reach
the sky world.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I believe that one of the
indicators to our earliest

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:84%
ancestors of a
place of great power

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
was the appearance
of mysterious lights.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It's known that a lot of
strange light phenomena

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:52.850 align:middle line:84%
is seen in those very mountains
where Gobekli Tepe is sighted.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:90%
We call them UFOs today.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.680 align:middle line:84%
But these type of
phenomena have been

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:84%
occurring for many, many
thousands of years, arguably

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:10%
I think that our
ancestors would have

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:10%
seen these as important signs,
that here were places where you

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:10%
could establish points
of contact, portals,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:10%
if you like, with the
other world, and that,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:10%
by building your monuments
here, that link with the stars

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:10%
would be stronger.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:84%
The downloads of information
that create civilization

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:90%
would be stronger.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Pillar 43 at Gobekli
Tepe is a sign board

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that shaman who
would be achieving

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.600 align:middle line:84%
altered states of consciousness
within the enclosures

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and then journeying in an
astral form to the upper world.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps a deeper
understanding

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:84%
of the relationship of
these ancient monuments

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
to Tabby's Star and
other galaxies is the key

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to understanding who
built them and why.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I've not examined
aerial views of Gobekli Tepe.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:10%
But the fact that some
people, some researchers,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.920 align:middle line:10%
are equating that
with a star map that

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:10%
depicts our relationship
would be the perfect match

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:10%
for not only the
Egyptian culture

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:10%
but for what we've discovered
in the construction

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids
themselves and the fact

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:10%
that this harmonic relationship
exists between this star.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And it could very well be that
what that cosmology was meant

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
to encapsulate and
describe is this idea

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
that our star is
interacting harmonically

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
with these other stellar bodies.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that this
ancient extraterrestrial race

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
that came to visit here not
only understood that but are

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
following that as
a sort of harmonic

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:90%
map around the universe.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>> If it is Indeed true that
Gobekli Tepe is a gateway

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.930 align:middle line:84%
to other galaxies,
then perhaps, somehow,

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
its architects knew a global
catastrophe was imminent

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and buried this ancient
technology to protect it.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> As the excavations continued,
a number of surprising things

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.270 align:middle line:90%
began to become clear.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:84%
First off, this potbellied
hill, and this whole site,

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
had not been covered up
by natural sedimentation.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:84%
After being in use
for about 1,000 years,

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
it was deliberately buried by
whoever was involved with it.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:84%
This was not some invading army
who came in and smashed it up.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
This was in a kind
of preservation.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
You must envisage teams
of hundreds of people

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:84%
with sort of buckets filled
with stone and rubble.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And they're coming.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're pouring it in on top
of the existing stone circles.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And they just keep on
pouring until every stone

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:47.630 align:middle line:90%
circle is covered.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.039 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the knowledge that
has been covered up preserve

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:10%
the mythology from almost
every ancient culture?

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Gobekli Tepe is a kind of--

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:10%
it's like a potpourri
of cultures.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:10%
You see a lot of
Sumerian influence.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of Egyptian
symbolism in Gobekli Tepe

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:17.223 align:middle line:84%
There's Hindu influence in
there as well, Japanese.

00:22:17.223 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, this
is where you start

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.660 align:middle line:90%
getting into this gray area.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.040 align:middle line:10%
Where does it come from?

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Was there a world's book,
a central point, where

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:90%
everybody got their ideas from?

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:10%
It seems to me that
Gobekli Tepe is

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:10%
almost like a microcosm
of so many cultures

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.800 align:middle line:10%
around the world that supposedly
never shared information

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:10%
with each other.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.415 align:middle line:84%
And now, we begin to
realize, actually,

00:22:39.415 --> 00:22:42.500 align:middle line:84%
they got around much more
than we gave the credit for.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the big secret at
Gobekli Tepe be the connection

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.980 align:middle line:10%
of every culture from
around the world?

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:10%
And could it have been
discovered at the right time

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:10%
to reveal information?

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:84%
There are many who
believe uncovering

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.280 align:middle line:84%
the answers to these
questions will transform

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:90%
how we understand ourselves.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I would be lying if I said
I knew what was exactly buried

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:90%
at Gobekli Tepe.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:10%
But I think what you can do
is draw a lot of similarities

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:10%
and parallels to some of
these other megalithic sites

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:17.960 align:middle line:10%
and get some pretty decent
scientific insight into what

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:10%
they were trying to accomplish.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.640 align:middle line:10%
And what it looks like they
were trying to accomplish

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:10%
is the preservation of
this scientific knowledge

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:10%
maybe at a time when there
was just such global upheaval

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:10%
that the only way to
preserve it was to bury it.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It could very well
be why they purposely

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.440 align:middle line:90%
buried the entire site.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
You're going to construct a
megalithic site of that kind

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:84%
of grandeur and scale, and put
that kind of effort into it,

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and then you're going to
turn around and just bury it?

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:54.728 align:middle line:90%
Why would any society do that?

00:23:54.728 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But whoever
built Gobekli Tepe,

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
the fact that they buried
that very important 30 acres

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
of these rings, of all of
these limestone columns,

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:13.460 align:middle line:84%
meant somebody, something,
knew it's something potentially

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:90%
destructive to the whole planet.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want
Gobekli Tepe they destroyed.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But Gobekli Tepe
survived until the 1990s.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Although Gobekli Tepe's
discovery in 1990 was

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
groundbreaking, research
has been problematic given

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.520 align:middle line:84%
the dangerous upheaval in the
area and the knowledge that

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.440 align:middle line:90%
still stays buried.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the discovery
of the Tabby's Star

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:84%
has become a beacon for
knowledge still preserved

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.840 align:middle line:84%
at Gobekli Tepe, pointing
us in a direction

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.930 align:middle line:90%
to uncover some human truths.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it is our
responsibility to preserve

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:84%
those records that are being
destroyed in this cradle

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.460 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, in the
Tigris-Euphrates, in Iraq,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.830 align:middle line:90%
in Syria, in Turkey.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
very intentionally

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:84%
being destroyed, in
some cases, to wipe out

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.740 align:middle line:84%
the memory of these
past civilizations

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.630 align:middle line:90%
for a number of reasons.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Once they're gone,
they're gone forever.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.647 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very sad
to see what's happening.

00:25:21.647 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's a wake up call.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
We've taken for granted
for so long the fact

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.273 align:middle line:84%
that these records are
here and that they exist.

00:25:28.273 --> 00:25:29.940 align:middle line:84%
We never really had
considered that they

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:90%
could be destroyed so easily.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> If they actually got the
funding, and got the effort,

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and they excavated the rest
of that 95% of that site,

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure what it's going
to do is answer a whole lot

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:84%
of mysteries about these
other megalithic sites.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I say
that is because here's

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.180 align:middle line:84%
a site that's completely
preserved, as far as we know.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It may be an actual perfect
construction of the science

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:90%
that they were trying to save.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And if that ends
up being the case,

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.440 align:middle line:84%
then I think what you'll
see is a resurgence

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:84%
all through humanity
and a real effort

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to try to rediscover what it
was that we're now missing,

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:18.660 align:middle line:84%
that we are a species
living with amnesia

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:90%
of what the science was.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's simply because we've
had such a turbulent history

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:10%
as a species, war, after
war, after cataclysm,

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:34.110 align:middle line:10%
after cataclysm, the Library
of Alexandria being burned,

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.540 align:middle line:10%
all of those things
mean that we've

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:10%
lost more knowledge, maybe,
than we even possess right now.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that
knowledge, when you really

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:84%
begin to study these ancient
sites, can be regained.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that's what
takes place with Gobekli Tepe.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we've got a lot of
mysterious cities built out

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:90%
of stone around the world.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of structure,
and only 5% of it

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:84%
has been excavated, means
that below that is such

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.120 align:middle line:90%
a massive amount to be found.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Gobekli Tepe has
many more secrets to reveal.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:84%
The astronomy of the
site is something

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that a number of researchers
are beginning to look into.

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's going
to be one of the keys

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:27.540 align:middle line:84%
to help us understand what
was going on at Gobekli Tepe.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
But there's nothing to
beat plain, old-fashioned

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:90%
excavation.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And that site
needs to be dug up.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:84%
I feel like Gobekli Tepe
is potentially so important

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:43.700 align:middle line:84%
for unraveling the origins
of our present civilizations

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that we really need to
expose the whole site

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.160 align:middle line:84%
and understand absolutely
what's going on there.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It may change many
things about how

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.120 align:middle line:90%
we view ourselves and our past.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something
more beyond that,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:06.270 align:middle line:84%
that some part of us comes from
the stars themself, and that,

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:09.020 align:middle line:84%
at the point of incarnation,
that something--

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:84%
we call it the soul
or the spirit--

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.740 align:middle line:84%
embodies within flesh
and blood, and exists,

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and that this gives us this
connection to the stars,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:84%
that the soul or spirit actually
comes from an extraterrestrial

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:90%
or a starry source.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.535 align:middle line:84%
>> What else lies buried inside
the potbellied grounds Gobekli

00:28:33.535 --> 00:28:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Tepe?

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Are there more secrets about
the true origins of mankind

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.550 align:middle line:90%
to be unearthed?

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Are we being prompted
by the communication

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:84%
with Tabby's Star to
dig deeper and connect

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.230 align:middle line:90%
with these ancient sites?

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Could there be some
kind of code that

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:84%
interlocks celestial locations
with monuments on Earth?

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Would it be possible
Gobekli Tepe could

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.040 align:middle line:84%
be the ultimate smoking gun
when it comes to connecting

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.130 align:middle line:84%
these ancient monuments
across the globe and the truth

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.170 align:middle line:90%
on why they exist?

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And could it reveal
a message that

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.390 align:middle line:84%
helps us understand our
current civilization

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and how to continue
humanity on this planet?

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Researchers continue
to gather data.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.680 align:middle line:84%
But the answer may still
lie buried beneath the dirt.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:84%
As the unraveling of
these mysteries continue,

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
some interesting
evidence begins to emerge

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.200 align:middle line:90%
from some unusual locations.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:10%
One such place has one of
the largest stones carved

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:38.130 align:middle line:10%
by human hands at 1,650 tons.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Baalbek is one of the big
enigmas of which there is very

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.950 align:middle line:10%
little answers.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a huge complex.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Around the temple of Jupiter,
there used to be 54 columns.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.550 align:middle line:84%
54, what's the
significance of that?

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Could this number sequence
help reveal a code at Baalbek?

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And is it possible
it could be more

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:90%
evidence of an ancient message?

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for the next season
of "Ancient Civilizations,"

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.390 align:middle line:84%
where we dive deeper to
unravel the code of humanity.
