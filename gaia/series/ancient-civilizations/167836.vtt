Archaeologists
have found evidence

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
pointing to several
examples of societies

this concept is
still unsettling.

Kennett of Pennsylvania State

of a matrilineal society

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:10%
in New Mexico's Chaco Canyon.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:84%

women were discovered

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.280 align:middle line:84%

than 15,000 turquoise necklaces

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:90%

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:10%
The remnants of these

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.290 align:middle line:10%
in an elite series
of burial chambers

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:10%

most noble members of Chacoan

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:10%
society.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:10%
And astoundingly, under
closer examination,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:10%
it was revealed that no fewer
than nine of the individuals

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.890 align:middle line:10%
shared the exact
same matrilineal

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:10%

from mother to child,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:10%
concluding that power and
influence was passed down

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:10%
through the female line.

going back at
least 30,000 years,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.090 align:middle line:10%
deep into the upper
paleolithic, you have these--

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:10%
they're referred to
as "goddess figures."

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
These are large-breasted,
large-hipped female figures.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
They're the dominant
iconography of that period.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:10%
And that-- and that
iconography continues

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:10%
all the way down through
the upper paleolithic

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:10%
and into the neolithic.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when
our ancestors venerated

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:90%
the goddess, not the male god.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In places like
Central Asia and Siberia,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
where the female shaman
or shamaness, if you wish,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
great power sources.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.750 align:middle line:10%
And obviously, the different
saints and-- and holy women

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:10%
of places like China and--
and India and within other

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:10%
societies like Norse
tradition, where-- where--

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:10%
with the very fierce
shield maidens and things

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:10%
like this that-- that
would go out in battle

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:10%
and be more powerful
than the many men.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:10%
But probably the last
vestige of this female role

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.170 align:middle line:10%
came down to us
through Greek tradition

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:10%
as the-- as the Amazon,
these incredible warriors,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.230 align:middle line:10%
this warrior caste that
supposedly only contained

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.820 align:middle line:10%
females.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
The Amazons weren't a
single tribe, though.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:10%
They seem to be a
buzzword for a number

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:10%
of different female
societies that--

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:10%
that survived in various
parts of the ancient world.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there were
Amazons in the Sahara.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of stories to do
with their-- their great deeds

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.830 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
There were Amazons in
the area of the Caucasus,

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:84%
what today is Georgia and
of the Russian steppes.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
There were others in
the Ural and the--

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:90%
and the Altai Mountains.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't
necessarily all one tribe.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But what they
seemed to represent

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
was the last vestige of
this-- this female caste that

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.323 align:middle line:84%
were the rulers, if you like,
of their domain, of their world.

00:04:37.323 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was something
that they did

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:84%
without the necessity of men,
other than for reproduction

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:90%
purposes.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that the key
to understanding this

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
is that the role of
the female in the past

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:84%
was much, much more
powerful, much more stronger,

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:90%
than we give it credit for.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And it could well
be that when we

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
look at the-- the builders of
Gobekli Tepe or the Anunnaki

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.480 align:middle line:84%
or those who built Stonehenge
were mainly female priesthoods.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's difficult to even
conceive of it in a way.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:84%
But it is strongly possible,
so we should never rule it out.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And we should always--
always be genderless,

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%

ancestors who gave us

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.510 align:middle line:84%

ancient wisdom.

is that they all

mention a mother goddess
that comes from the depths.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Sophia is the
mother of the abyss

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:84%
because, as the
story goes, she went

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
to the deepest
point of the abyss

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:84%

the abyss is always linked
to the process of creation.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:90%
All mother goddesses were.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Sophia really comes from
a Greek term, "sophos,"

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:90%
which means "wisdom."

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
before there was even

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:84%
a god or a creative force,
everything was dark.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Nothing existed.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:10%
And because God and
wisdom and knowledge

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.670 align:middle line:10%
are simultaneous
with each other,

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:10%
they figured, well,
if that's the case,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.100 align:middle line:10%
then wisdom must have
existed in the dark.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And in order for it
to be procreative,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:90%
it had to be feminine.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So they created this concept
of a divine feminine person,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.607 align:middle line:84%
a woman, who embodied the
whole perfection of the wisdom

00:06:55.607 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and all the sum knowledge
of everything that

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:90%
exists in the universe.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So the Greeks show up, and
they called her "Sophia,"

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.340 align:middle line:84%
based on "sophos,"
the term for "wisdom."

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> If wisdom emerged from the
darkness and its procreative

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
nature was feminine by
some early accounts,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
then why at some point was
it forgotten or switched?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:84%
In the biblical stories of
the garden of Eden, Yahweh--

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:84%
or God-- forbids the
humans in the garden

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to partake from the
forbidden tree of knowledge.

When a serpent seduces Eve to
eat an apple from this tree,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.570 align:middle line:84%
it leads to mankind's
expulsion from the garden

and thereby from eternal life.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
But according to Anton
Parks, the Sumerian texts

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%
interpret this
story differently.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:84%
They suggest that the
serpent approaches the woman

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:90%

and we understand that the man
was doing more manual work.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The text states that the secret
was given by the serpent.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
The serpent tells the woman, and
then she goes to tell the man.

The so-called secret
that the serpent

is going to tell the woman,
found in Sumerian tablets,

is the secret of tool making.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.405 align:middle line:10%
Quite simply, the tool,
which is expressed

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:10%
as "ngis" in Sumerian,
means "tree" and "tool."

Well, he has a desire
to set them free.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:10%
The woman is generally
wise, intelligent.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:84%
She is enlightened from
motherhood, from the origins,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and has the intelligence
and wisdom of the serpent.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:84%
If we read the original
Sumerian texts,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%
the woman only passes
on the information

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:84%
that was given to
her by the serpent.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:10%
The civilizing
tool for mankind is

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:10%
to become self-sufficient
and free itself from slavery.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:10%
What's more, in Sumerian
tablets of Eden, when the woman

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:10%
messenger is mentioned,
she is very often

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:10%
called the "wise woman."

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:10%
>> If there was a wise woman,
where did she disappear to?

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:10%
Researchers like
Freddy Silva have

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:10%
discovered that
other stories that

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:10%
empower women in
ancient evolution

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:10%
have been omitted
from the Bible.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the greatest examples
of the shift from matriarchal

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
to patriarchal society really
evolves around the story

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus, believe it or not.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge misconstruct.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And we know this because two
of the most important pieces

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
of evidence, which were the
gospels of Philip and Thomas,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
were banned by the Church
until they were inconveniently

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
found by two goat herders in
the desert at Nag Hammadi.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was that when
you joined a secret mysticism

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
school, you joined
as a son of a woman.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
When you graduated
from that, you

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
went up to another
level of understanding.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.550 align:middle line:90%
You graduated as a son of a man.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:84%
If you got to the next stage,
you became son of the gods.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and this is the
most interesting part--

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:84%
when you actually went into
the final initiation process--

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
and "initiation" means
"to become conscious."

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:90%
That's what the word means--

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
you undertook a
out-of-body experience.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It was an induced
near-death experience

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.490 align:middle line:84%
where you took a narcotic,
almost like a poison, which

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
lowers your heartbeat
down to a point where

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:90%
you are virtually comatose.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Back in those days,
those sects held

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.970 align:middle line:84%
that the women had the
highest level of initiation.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:84%
They actually were
responsible for the initiate

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.398 align:middle line:84%
while he or she undertook
this out-of-body experience.

00:11:11.398 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
They were called the "bees" or
the "watchtower," the "flock,"

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
Mary Magdalene's name,

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
"Migdal-Eder," the
"watchtower of the flock."

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Your soul leaves the body
anywhere between three to seven

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And you come back into your
body a little bit groggy.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And you are taken out by the
priestesses onto a mound.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
you see is the rising

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
of Venus, the morning star,
at the spring equinox.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why Jesus compares
himself to the morning star.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So did Osiris in Egypt, who
was also a disembodied man who

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:90%
gets chopped up by 72 people.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he
reconstitutes himself,

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
which is the symbol of the
resurrected in a human being.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.127 align:middle line:84%
The shift from
matriarchal to patriarchal

00:11:53.127 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
really happens around the
time where the Catholic Church

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to find its roots,
when fundamental Christianity

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:84%
splits from Gnostic
Christianity.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And the fundamentalists
were killing

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:90%
all the Gnostic Christians.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it really be true
that details about the ages

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.320 align:middle line:84%
of matriarchal rule were
censored from some ancient

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:90%
text?

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva has
discovered a similar text

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:84%
to the Gnostic story
about Mary Magdalene that

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.978 align:middle line:90%
is written in the Quran.

00:12:20.978 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Two most important people,
John the Baptist and Mary

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene, are basically given
very minor roles in the Bible.

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And now we know why, because
we have the patriarchal system

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.890 align:middle line:84%
that takes away the
concept of the matriarchal

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
being the most important
part of initiation.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they went off
and killed everybody

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.643 align:middle line:84%
around the Middle East
that could say otherwise.

00:12:40.643 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:10%
That's the one thing
that they-- all the sects

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:10%
have in common,
including early Islam,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:10%
by the way, that says
exactly the same thing,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:10%
that the actual crucifixion
didn't really take place.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And the person that actually
was crucified in the real event

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:90%
was actually not Jesus.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a guy called
Simon of Cyrene.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the-- you know,
the Quran saying this.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.087 align:middle line:84%
So the Church annihilates
everybody else

00:13:02.087 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
that was saying the
complete opposite.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we now have a
patriarchal system, instead of

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:90%
a matriarchal system.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's how easily this
concept gets taken apart.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I think in the past, female
cultures have been given a--

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:90%
a bad press.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:10%
We know about kingship.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:10%
We know about great
battles fought by men.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
whole civilization

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:84%
seems to be focused around
patriarchal societies.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, that was not the
case in prehistoric times.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:10%
It would seem as if the female
had a much stronger role

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:10%
in society and may even
have been the controlling

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:10%
influences governing the places
of power, which would have been

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:10%
seen as the axis mundi, the
axis of the Earth, possibly

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:10%
even having a seat of power,
you know, the origin of what

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.790 align:middle line:10%
we would call the throne today.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, they
were the first kings.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.160 align:middle line:84%
They were the embodiment
of life itself.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:10%
From them, all life
came, of course,

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:10%
as it's only women
that can bear children.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And this was understood by
men, recognized and honored

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
by men, who had a
different role in life.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as to exactly
what that was,

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to stereotype
any of these images.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:90%
But something changed over time.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is indeed true, what
has changed since the early

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
ages where a matriarchal society
governed our planet peacefully?

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Anton Parks believes that
the rise of patriarchy

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
began when humans decided
to go out on their own

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:90%
and start building cities.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
According to his research,
the Sumerian texts

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:84%
show us how the war
between Enki and Enlil

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
is reflected in the origin
of the struggle for power

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.681 align:middle line:90%
between men and women.

00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.373 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.373 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If you try to distinguish
between the two energies that

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
drive matriarchy and patriarchy,
we can find it in all the texts

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:90%
that speak of this.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It is constantly the fight
between Mars and Venus,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
war and peace, finding a
balance between the two.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
With my research
on Sumerian Eden,

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:90%
I found a historical event.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:84%
We are not speaking
about legends here,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:90%
but of the history of Sumer.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
It is about the two cities
who are fighting each other.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:10%
Both of them were part
of the realm of Umma.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
The two towns were
situated in front

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of the realm of
Shirpurla, which means

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:90%
the "bird of eternal youth."

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The Shirpurla realm
is led by Enlil.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.560 align:middle line:84%
If you translate the
Sumerian term "uma na,"

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:84%
you get the
following definition,

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
"the people of Umma" or "the
people of the wise woman,"

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.050 align:middle line:84%
because "Umma," means "the
wise woman" in Sumerian.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Here's the idea of
wise woman again,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
of the woman who
passed down the secret.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.510 align:middle line:10%
Thanks to this
definition, we understand

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:10%
that Umma was under the
guardianship of some goddesses

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:10%
that were associated with
Enki and with the knowledge

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:10%
of the gods because, in French,
a wise woman, literally "sage

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.870 align:middle line:10%
femme," is a midwife.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And for Sumerians,
it is the woman

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
in charge of the genetics,
the one in charge

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:90%
of the artificial matrices.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The play on words is between
"sage femme," midwife,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.260 align:middle line:90%
and "femme sage," wise woman.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it is the realm led
by the mother goddess and Enki.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Between the two realms is a
stretch of land, a palm grove.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
It is a sort of small
garden called the "Guedena."

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
This can be translated as
the "frontier of the plane."

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
In this historical battle
between the two realms,

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:01.800 align:middle line:84%
we find many elements that can
be linked to the Sumerian Eden.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Through this story,
we understand

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.359 align:middle line:84%
that the dispute
between Enki and Enlil

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:90%
never really had an end.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if you study the
text very thoroughly,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:84%
it is impossible to know what
put an end to these conflicts

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:90%
between Umma and Shirpurla.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:10%
The one thing we know
is that one city of Umma

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:10%
was wiped out quickly.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Kings always mentioned
the divine protection

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.690 align:middle line:84%
given by Enlil and his
son in royal texts,

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.540 align:middle line:84%
always reducing the
inhabitants of Umma

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
to simple workers that
were only good to serve

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.540 align:middle line:84%
the realm of Lagash and to
submit to the patriarchal gods.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Could there be more evidence
of this throughout history?

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>> About 5,000 years ago, when
you get the emergence of--

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:84%
at least in our timeline, of the
first-- the first great cities.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be when
this testosterone-driven male

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
aggression and anger start
to take everything over.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And-- and the goddess
is phased out.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
We still have goddesses,
but they're not

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle line:84%
running the world
anymore, the way

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
they appear to have done
in much more-- in much

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:90%
more ancient times.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a clear
change of emphasis,

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.250 align:middle line:90%
and we start having male gods.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're often very angry and
aggressive and domineering male

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:90%
gods.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And they want to go take
other people's stuff.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It's as though some
sort of mental virus

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:90%
has entered the world.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And-- and we've
become these creatures

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
fizzing with testosterone,
making war upon one another.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:84%
You'd be hard put to
find evidence of warfare

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:84%
in the upper paleolithic, when
the goddess ruled the world.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.123 align:middle line:84%
There was no-- there
was no warfare.

00:18:39.123 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:84%
These people, they
were hunting animals.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:10%
But they weren't
killing each other,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:10%
not in large
numbers at any rate.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:84%
They may have had the odd
fight, but they weren't--

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
they weren't making
war upon one another.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But you come down
into the neolithic,

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:84%
as we begin to see the
goddess cult trailing off

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and male gods
taking their place,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
and warfare becomes a very key
element of-- of human behavior.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And so I think that--

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that an old ethic and an
old way of doing things, which

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
was harmonious and
beautiful and was sustained

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
for tens of thousands
of years, was overthrown

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:90%
by the upsurge of the male ego.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And I would tie that very
much at its worst to the time

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
of the emergence of the-- of the
first cities, you know, from--

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.655 align:middle line:84%
in our historical timeline,
ancient Sumer, for example.

00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> As patriarchy
took over matriarchy,

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:84%
women lost their
place in society.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Their role as goddesses
and spiritual leaders

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
was undermined by
a new perspective.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Women were indoctrinated as
untrustworthy seductresses.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Sean Stone describes
how this point of view

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.260 align:middle line:84%
marked an era of separation
between men and women.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>> In the old tradition was
really a joint male/female

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:90%
partnership.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of
Sumerian time, we

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:84%
recognize that
Enki seems to have

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:90%
been considered more of that--

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that trickster character,
more of the devil

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:84%
in the garden who essentially
gives humans knowledge.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:10%
When Enki gives humans the right
to procreate with each other

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:10%
without the permission
of the gods,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:10%
that's when Enlil
and the other gods

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:10%
feel that their reign is being
threatened by the humans.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:10%
So Enki seems to
become the devil.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
He's cast in the devil
role and perhaps women,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:84%
as well, as a result because
that whole concept of man

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
and woman, Enki and
Enma, working together

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:90%
to fashion humankind is lost.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So by the time you come to the
Jewish tradition, for example,

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.623 align:middle line:84%
you've lost any notion
of a female role

00:20:48.623 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:84%
in the spirituality,
the religion.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:90%
The god Jehovah is a male god.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:10%
You see no female rabbis
in any Jewish tradition

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.410 align:middle line:10%
until about the 16th, 17th
centuries-- same, obviously,

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:10%
within the Catholic Church,
the notion that there really

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:10%
can be no female pope,
female cardinals or bishops.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:11.026 align:middle line:84%
It's a very masculine control
of the religious inclination.

00:21:11.026 --> 00:21:15.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Another important example
of the complete takeover

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:84%
of-- of society
by patriarchs has

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
occurred by the time of
the Greek civilization.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Basically, by 500 BC and
thereafter all the way

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
through Rome, women are
second-class citizens.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:90%
They have no right to vote.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:39.520 align:middle line:84%
They have no real voice in
anything beyond the household.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
They are essentially
outside of the society.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
You can see basically, step
by step, this dissent away

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:84%
from the notion of a man and
woman working in conjunction

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.870 align:middle line:84%
to fashion humanity, to
essentially guide humanity.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.740 align:middle line:10%
It becomes more and more the
assertion of the male energy,

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:10%
the male totem, basically.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And that ultimately,
I would say,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
manifests itself in the
overall nature of our society.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what Tesla
was looking, for example,

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
at the nature-- the nature of
energy creation and production,

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
he was pointing out that what we
have is explosive energy, which

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:90%
is male.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a male exertion,
whereas the female energy

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:90%
is considered more vortical.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So only a few of
the scientists that

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:84%
were looking into alternative
forms of energy that basically

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
was more vortical, what
people describe by UFO craft,

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
for example, and the way that
their propulsion systems work,

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that is essentially a
female style of energy,

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:84%
where it ideally
recycles itself.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:10%
>> When you look at the
origins of warfare--

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:10%
and this is organized warfare--

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:10%
you don't actually find
any good evidence for it

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:10%
until somewhere roughly between
about 9,000 and 6,000 BC.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.660 align:middle line:84%
That's when real organized
warfare seemed to start.

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that was after
the Neolithic Revolution.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:10%
Prior to that, yeah, you do find
occasional skeletons showing

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:10%
signs of violence, you
know, just individual human

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:12.960 align:middle line:10%
against human violence.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's always been that.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:84%
But this whole
thing about humans

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
actually organizing into armies
and getting together in groups

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:84%
and then let's go charge
against the other group and then

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
the other group having to
then respond in the same way

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:84%
by forming their own little
army, that didn't actually

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
happen until after the
neolithic, by most accounts.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> We talked about the Gnostic
tradition and this issue

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
of precisely who
created the reality.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Was it the male god,
the male demiurge,

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:90%
who fashioned the world?

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Or was it the sophia spirit,
divine spirit, wisdom,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.110 align:middle line:90%
who came into the reality?

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:10%
And I think that the darker
interpretations have oftentimes

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:10%
given onus and power
to the male form,

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.367 align:middle line:10%
whereas the older
traditions might actually

00:24:03.367 --> 00:24:04.950 align:middle line:10%
recognize and respect
the fact that it

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.020 align:middle line:10%
was male and female
working in conjunction,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:10%
in unison, to really
create the human existence.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Take, for example, the
Anunnaki stories about Enki.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Enki was this
chief scientist who

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:84%
was trying to design the human
race on behalf of the sky gods.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:10%
But in order to do so, he
needed Ninmah, who was basically

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.075 align:middle line:10%
his partner and consort.

00:24:30.075 --> 00:24:33.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking back
to Sumerian times,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
civilizations of war seem
to be preceded and followed

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.220 align:middle line:90%
by civilizations of peace.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's possible that
humanity will embrace again

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
a future cycle of
matriarchy, a society where

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
we become more cooperative
and less aggressive.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I like to look at
statistics and evidence.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:10%
And Steven Pinker wrote
a very interesting book

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:10%
called "The Better
Angels of our Nature."

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:10%
And he did a long-term
study showing that contrary

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.280 align:middle line:10%
to the images we're getting
on TV of the warfare--

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:10%
and of course, the images
we're getting are very real.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.447 align:middle line:90%
We need to solve that.

00:25:13.447 --> 00:25:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They're very important issues
that we needed to deal with.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But overall,
statistically, warfare

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:84%
has been declining over
a fairly long period.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing this
general progression

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
of a generally less violent,
less warlike global society.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:84%
But corresponding
with that is we've

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:84%
seen the role of women increase
during the same period of time.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.500 align:middle line:10%
I believe that there's a
relationship between that.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I think the more that women
have a role in governance

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and in equality, we're going
to see more of that trend

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:53.620 align:middle line:84%
happen, because back in the
days, going back much earlier

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
when we didn't really have
organized human warfare,

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.710 align:middle line:90%
they were much more matriarchal.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So shifting the power
balance to patriarchy,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.120 align:middle line:84%
there are probably all kinds
of biological reasons for that.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:10%
They were the ones who had to
go out and hunt the mastodon

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:10%
while the woman is giving life.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that shift between
what we have in our DNA as men

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and as women because of
that old role probably

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.590 align:middle line:84%
then affects the level of
violence in-- in our society.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The disappearing wise
woman to me refers to our--

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:84%
our loss of intuition,
our heart intelligence,

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
which should be
our guiding light.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.420 align:middle line:10%
To be whole, we need
both intuition and logic,

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:10%
which is kind of the feminine
and the masculine principles.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.490 align:middle line:10%
You need some structure
to your intuition, or else

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:10%
you kind of-- you
could get delusional

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.112 align:middle line:10%
without some structure.

00:26:49.112 --> 00:26:51.070 align:middle line:84%
We've been cut off from
the heart intelligence.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And all we have is this
logical, rational, egoic mind.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.157 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we start really
going down the path of error.

00:26:58.157 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And I do believe there are
signs now that we're starting

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
to hopefully correct
the situation as more

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and more people are,
you know, returning

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.020 align:middle line:84%
to that kind of inner
voice, you know,

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.442 align:middle line:84%
that voice that-- the light
of conscience, really.

00:27:10.442 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the light of conscience.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.031 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll get back
to a state of wholeness.

00:27:14.031 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>> If wholeness is the meaning
of joint feminine and masculine

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.610 align:middle line:84%
energies in the world
ruling by partnership,

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.930 align:middle line:90%
then what is our next step?

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Could ancient history lead us
down a new path of thinking?

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.650 align:middle line:84%
If we, as the
current civilization,

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:34.560 align:middle line:84%
are Indeed returning
to our inner voice,

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:84%
then could this inner
voice be leading us

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
to a much older civilization
that has now just emerged

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:90%
from the ice?

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You get reports occasionally
of structures emerging out

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.870 align:middle line:90%
of the ice, Antarctica.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Just recently, there was
one which took my attention

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
to do with what was described
as almost like an embanked area,

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.160 align:middle line:84%
like a hill fort,
that was found.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And that struck my attention
as being different to all

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.110 align:middle line:90%
the other stories.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Anybody who's a pure-blooded
Indian or native person

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:16.150 align:middle line:10%
in the Americas, their whole
haplo group or genetics are A,

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:10%
B, C, or D. But we've tested
three of these so far,

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:10%
and they are not A, B, C, or D.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They show ancestry either
from Europe or the Middle East

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:84%
or the Middle East people
who move to Europe.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So that completely
blows the theory

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:84%
that there was only one
way to get to the Americas

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:90%
in pre-Columbian times.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Could new evidence of a
civilization much older than

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:84%
that discovered at Gobekli Tepe
be emerging from a desolate

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:90%
continent?

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Up next, the code unravels--

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:90%
or should we say, melts--

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.650 align:middle line:84%
from Antarctica to reveal
a possible new species

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.710 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:05.000 align:middle line:90%
