00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In August of 2012, a research
team helmed by Quentin Atkinson

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:84%
of the University of Auckland
in New Zealand utilized certain

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
algorithmic methods which
analyzed phonetics from over

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
100 ancient and
modern-day languages.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Their methods were similar to
tracing evolutionary biology

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
by starting at the
branches of the family tree

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.340 align:middle line:90%
and finding the root.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:10%
Their goal was to figure out if
all the languages in the world

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:10%
derived from the same area.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
In an interview
with NPR, Quentin

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
explained how they
gathered this data.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What we use are what
are called cognates.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:10%
These are words that
show similar forms that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:10%
indicates that they are
related by a common ancestry,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:10%
over 6,000 across the 200
meanings in 100 languages.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we can
build, it's our data matrix,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:90%
we call it.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And so if you imagine down
the left-hand side of the data

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:84%
matrix, you've got
all your languages.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And then along the top
of the data matrix,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
you've got all the
possible cognates

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.220 align:middle line:90%
that we have identified.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And you fill in that
matrix by putting a 0

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
if that language doesn't
have the cognate and a 1

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
if the language does
have that cognate.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:10%
And if you fill that in
for all the cognates,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:10%
you get this sequence of 1's
and 0's for each language.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's a bit like
having a sequence of DNA

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.920 align:middle line:90%
for each language.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.326 align:middle line:84%
And that's the data that we
then input into our analysis.

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Through their research, they
pinned down the eight millennia

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
old origin of the largest
global language ever created.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
They also determined
all of these languages

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.285 align:middle line:90%
began in one area.

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:10%
>> There are two competing
theories for where these

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:10%
languages came from.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.850 align:middle line:10%
The first theory was put
forward by Marija Gimbutas,

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.180 align:middle line:10%
an archaeologist.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.620 align:middle line:10%
And she argued the
languages spread out

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:10%
from the Russian steppes region
about 5,000 to 6,000 years ago.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's linked to
archaeological evidence

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:90%
for an expansion at that time.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
The alternative theory
is that the languages

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.162 align:middle line:84%
spread much earlier from
Anatolia, what is now Turkey.

00:02:53.162 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> This interesting study
done by Atkinson relates

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
to an ancient story about the
Tower of Babel in the Hebrew

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Bible.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.020 align:middle line:84%
In Genesis 11:1 through 9,
it states "Everyone on Earth

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.660 align:middle line:90%
once spoke the same language.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.815 align:middle line:84%
As people migrated east, they
settled in the land of Shinar."

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> For those who are
not familiar with it,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the Tower of Babel is a biblical
story about the idea of a group

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
of people who are all centered
in their civilisation around

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:90%
a tower.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And this tower
somehow allowed them

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:84%
to have all the same
language and to all be

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.253 align:middle line:90%
able to speak to one another.

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Then the legend
reports that there

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of
destruction of the tower,

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and in this aftermath
of this happening,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.613 align:middle line:84%
that the people
themselves were scattered.

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:10%
And they no longer could
speak the same tongue

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.550 align:middle line:10%
or the same language.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.440 align:middle line:10%
And thus, we became confused.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.905 align:middle line:10%
It's a fall from
grace-type story.

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
You have to
understand that there

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.827 align:middle line:84%
is a very significant
difference between how

00:03:45.827 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
the scholarship on the
ancient civilizations

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.293 align:middle line:84%
is seen in the open
unclassified world as opposed

00:03:50.293 --> 00:03:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to how it is being seen
within the secret government

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.047 align:middle line:84%
and the military
industrial complex.

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:90%
They are going back.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.797 align:middle line:84%
And they are looking at
every single mythology

00:03:57.797 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:90%
that they can find.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.055 align:middle line:84%
And they're asking very
important questions which need

00:04:01.055 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:90%
to have scientific answers.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.202 align:middle line:84%
One of the questions is, what in
the world was a Tower of Babel?

00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:10%
They have started to
learn that no matter

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:10%
what the ancient mythology
is, you dig deep enough,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.550 align:middle line:10%
you double click on it, and
you find out, wait a minute,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:10%
there is something here that
suggests this is not a myth.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
to note that in 1899

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
in the town of Sippar there
was a very interesting stone

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:84%
tablet that was found
right near where

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Babylon was originally located.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And it actually has an x marks
the spot treasure map-type

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
derivation of the location of
the Tower of Babel, allegedly.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Now what's
interesting about that

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
is that the Tower of Babel x
marks the spot location is up

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.395 align:middle line:90%
in Turkey.

00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This possibly new
understanding of where

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
the Tower of Babel was located
coincides nicely with Anton

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Parks's research of the garden
of Eden and the understanding

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
of the language according
to Sumerian texts.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:10%
>> We were able to locate the
divine mountain of the Anunna

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:10%
gods along with
their garden of Eden,

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:10%
thanks to the elements found
with Google Earth and Gerry

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.460 align:middle line:10%
Zeitlin from NASA.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
It took us straight to eastern
Turkey, close to road 5651.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:10%
What can be noted in the
Sumerian tablets, when they

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:10%
clearly speak of creating
workers to serve the Anunnas,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:10%
the main geneticist
is always Enki.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Enki is very proud
of what he is doing.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:84%
However, he always has
to do it in secret.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And here, something important
occurs in the research

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:90%
that I've carried out.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
In order to be able to
secretly teach values,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
besides from changing
their genetic code,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.060 align:middle line:84%
in which he probably injected
things that we cannot

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:84%
comprehend nowadays, the gods
were using a specific language

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
in Eden, the Emean language,
the language that comes from

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:53.002 align:middle line:84%
the skies, the language
which comes from An.

00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:10%
In my years of
research, I understood

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:10%
that the Emesa, the
matrix language,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:10%
was mostly used by
Sumerian priestesses.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The so-called Emesa
contained more particles

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:84%
than the languages
used by the male gods.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:10%
So Enki used the Emesa,
the matrix language,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.260 align:middle line:10%
to encode the ancient
languages we find on Earth.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.180 align:middle line:10%
| think that Enki had
the desire to work

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.220 align:middle line:10%
for the benefit
of the human race,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:10%
to secretly bring
them knowledge.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to do that,
they had to use a code.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:84%
So they created a linguistic
code for each tribe.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that regularly,
maybe every generation,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:84%
they had to change
the code to prevent

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.155 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnas from finding out
about the hidden knowledge.

00:06:34.155 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It is interesting
to note that according

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
to Anton's research, the
language that has been coded

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
into the universe for the humans
to speak is called the matrix

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.560 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
In Sumerian, this
means the language

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that the female life
creators, like Tiamat, spoke.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
How has this coded
language helped

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.601 align:middle line:84%
us survive against the
wrath of the demiurge?

00:06:58.601 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a crucial
part of my work.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I discovered that
all common languages

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:90%
were coded from Sumerian.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.090 align:middle line:84%
We can look for idioms
from anywhere we want--

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.560 align:middle line:84%
African tribes, Native American
tribes, all the way to China.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:10%
When you get to the innermost
part of primitive languages,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:10%
you can always understand
the words in Sumerian.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:10%
For example, if you
take the word tool

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:10%
in the language of
an African tribe,

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.500 align:middle line:10%
and you translate
it into Sumerian,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:10%
it will become the thing
we use to chop wood.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:10%
The idea is a code used in
order to be able to communicate

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:10%
secretly with humans.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:84%
In concrete terms, this idea
of coding language and creating

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.130 align:middle line:84%
new ones with Sumerian
syllables, this desire

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.840 align:middle line:84%
to be able to communicate
secretly with the human race,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is going to design the many
different languages on Earth--

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
old Chinese, the Hopi,
many of the ancient idioms

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:84%
we find in Africa
or in Australia.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
We can find common roots with
ancient German and ancient

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:90%
English.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Enki knew for a fact that
human beings would not

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
be submissive to the
gods on the whole planet.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So he gifted them with
the ability to make tools

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and, in my theory,
he also wished

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to code human language so the
gods could not understand.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Anton Parks suggests
that once the humans had

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.600 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge to
survive on Earth,

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:84%
they sought to build their own
future and escape the gods.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Could there be an actual builder
of this new human settlement?

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:10%
In the Hebrew Bible, it
suggests that the builder

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:10%
of the Tower of Babel
was the king of Shinar.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.640 align:middle line:10%
And his name was Nimrod.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.350 align:middle line:10%
What an interesting
name for someone

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:10%
who defies the laws of Yahweh
to create his own connection

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:10%
to the creator.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Could Nimrod have been
the representation

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
of the first group
of humans to use

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.545 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge taught by Enki?

00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Nimrod,
interesting character,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
he was said to have
built the Tower of Babel.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:10%
He went up against
god himself, tried

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:10%
to get closer than anybody
else had ever done.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
As a result, god struck
down the Tower of Babel

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and, as a punishment to humanity
for having attempted this act,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
confused the languages so
that everybody couldn't

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:90%
understand everybody else.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything more
behind this story?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
of importance?

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is the
Tower of Babel?

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:10%
The Babylonian civilization
is focused around Babylon.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.040 align:middle line:10%
And Babylon is in Lower Iraq.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
They now see this area
as the center of reality,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:90%
the center of everything.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the omphalas, the axis
mundi, the axis of the Earth.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
That gravitational shift
from northern Mesopotamia

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.730 align:middle line:84%
to southern Mesopotamia was
the result of the Babylonians.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
This is why the ancient city
of Uruk is in southern Iraq,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:84%
when all the old accounts say
that it was the ancient name

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:90%
for Urfa in Southeast Turkey.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:84%
This is why Nimrod is associated
now with Babylon and not

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.154 align:middle line:90%
with Southeast Turkey.

00:10:08.154 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The biblical story of Nimrod
and his area of proposed reign

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
happened to be in the same
area that a group of ancient

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:90%
astrologers once resided.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:84%
This group was
called the Chaldeans.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Could this ancient
group have been

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.031 align:middle line:84%
practicing some of the
ancient teachings by Enki?

00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Urfa was the
stronghold of Nimrod.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
This was the traditional
homeland of the Chaldeans.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:90%
They were star worshippers.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:90%
They recorded stars.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.478 align:middle line:84%
They had knowledge of comets,
knowledge of eclipses,

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and everything like this.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They were the
scientists of their day.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So what Abraham
is trying to do is

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:84%
knock down their beliefs, their
ideas, their mystery tradition,

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:90%
and install this new idea.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So it is possible that
what he was trying to do

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:04.820 align:middle line:84%
is to, essentially, kill off
the Western tradition that

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
had been that of the
Chaldeans up to this point,

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and that Nimrod somehow
steps in, whoever

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
or whatever he represents,
to try and prevent this

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:90%
from happening.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, according
to the legends, god intervenes,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.080 align:middle line:84%
saves Abraham, and that's
essentially the story.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.970 align:middle line:10%
So yes, there is
something in this.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:10%
I do accept that what
Abraham was trying to do

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.050 align:middle line:10%
is bring in to a new
era that didn't need

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:10%
our connection with the stars.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But what the implications
of that is for Judaism

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
or even Christianity,
I don't know.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this battle between
Abraham and Nimrod really be

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
representing a battle between
Enki and Enlil for the control

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:90%
over the human race?

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:10%
>> What the Mesopotamian
story tells us,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:10%
that Enki introduced
contention into human speech.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.880 align:middle line:10%
And there are
biblical scholars who

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:10%
think that that was the basis,
then, of the Tower of Babel

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:10%
story.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's
interesting though is,

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
earlier, Enki was said to
be the provider of wisdom.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
He was said to have been
the one who wanted humanity

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to have the knowledge
that would undo the gods

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.100 align:middle line:90%
or the control of the gods.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
kind of conflict now

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:90%
in the Mesopotamian stories.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:31.195 align:middle line:84%
People who have really studied
the Mesopotamian stories--

00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking very
good biblical scholars

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and Mesopotamian scholars--

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:84%
they're so ambivalent
about the Enki figure.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:84%
They say, yeah, he was
said to be this great guy.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.760 align:middle line:84%
He sometimes is
identified with the snake

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:90%
in the garden of Eden.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And then he later became
identified with Prometheus

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:84%
in the Greek version
of the story,

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:84%
where Prometheus tries to
come down and give humanity

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.990 align:middle line:84%
this certain knowledge
that would advance them.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the other gods
come in and say no no,

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:90%
you can't do that.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And then there are all these
repercussions to humanity

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:90%
in dividing them up.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
The people in the
Tower of Babel story

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
were really anarchists who
were opposing the Archons.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying, the
heck with the Archons.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:90%
We're leaving.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.813 align:middle line:84%
We're going to establish
own little anarchy.

00:13:15.813 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to move over
here and build our own city.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
do things on our own.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And what was it that they
were going to do their way?

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Just eight miles north of
the ancient city of Urfa

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:84%
is another famous site
known as Gobekli Tepe.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.760 align:middle line:84%
All that is revealed is
the top of what could have

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:90%
been a great tower of sorts.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
95% of the site remains
below ground to be uncovered.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Could the ancient humans
have gathered here

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.436 align:middle line:84%
to use their knowledge
of the universe?

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Gobekli Tepe is the
oldest stone circle complex

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:10%
in the world, if you can
imagine Stonehenge in England,

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:10%
and transpose it onto the top
of a mountain top in Southeast

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:10%
Turkey, and then multiply
it by at least 20 times,

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:12.010 align:middle line:10%
and then cover the stones with
beautiful carvings of animals

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.610 align:middle line:10%
and representations
of abstract humans,

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:10%
and give them
[? T-shaped ?] tops.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:84%
The fact is that Gobekli Tepe
is in northern Mesopotamia.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.870 align:middle line:84%
This is clearly the cradle
of civilization in this area.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
Neolithic Revolution began.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.935 align:middle line:84%
This is where even the
archaeologist Klaus Schmidt,

00:14:34.935 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Gobekli Tepe, who
discovered the site,

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the Anunnaki
had their power base.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, a lot of
things started here.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:10%
>> A site only becomes sacred
upon the foundations of many,

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:10%
many old temples.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:10%
Gobekli Tepe is
one great example.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.158 align:middle line:10%
It's an entire artificial hill.

00:14:55.158 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
The clue is actually the
name, the original name.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:10%
It means potbelly
hill or the hill

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:10%
of the navel in its true
context, which, to me, tells me

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:10%
that it's a navel of the Earth.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:10%
And like so many other navels
of the Earth around the world,

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:10%
it's a place where
the rules of physics

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:10%
work in a certain way that
allows you communication

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:10%
with other levels of reality.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.270 align:middle line:10%
>> The whole evolution of
language in the human Homo

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:10%
sapiens sapiens brain has
been cultivated, manipulated,

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.500 align:middle line:10%
and managed by technologies
that could influence the human

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:10%
brain's development of language.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And that when we read
about the Tower of Babel

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
being a time when the human
population had one language,

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
had one thought
system, if it's true

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that there have been competing
geopolitical territorial

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
forces, competing
non-humans on this planet,

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:84%
and that there was a time
when humans were unified,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that would not have been a
good step for the competing

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:90%
non-humans.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And it could very well be
the Tower of Babel story

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:84%
was one of those moments where
humans had been homogenized.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:10%
And something did not want that
homogeneity in human thought,

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:10%
humans together, humans
working as a group.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And that from the outside,
there was a disruption in what,

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:84%
for just a brief
moment, may have

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.920 align:middle line:84%
been a unification in thought
without war or conflict

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.726 align:middle line:90%
of human beings.

00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Unification, a dangerous
thing to have if you plan

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:90%
to rule over a people.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But could this unification have
been an actual tower or just

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.580 align:middle line:84%
an ancient location
where people gathered

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to exchange knowledge,
a location in which they

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.015 align:middle line:84%
could communicate
important information?

00:16:58.015 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Babylon is actually an old
Sumerian word which means gate

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
of God, which, for me and my
understanding of the ancient

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:84%
mysteries, tells me
everything I need to know.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
Anything referred to as a gate
of God or a navel of the Earth

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:84%
is usually an energetic hotspot
where the laws of physics

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
are slightly
different, or just so,

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:84%
that allows you to
step through a portal

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:90%
into a level of existence.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
For me, the Tower of Babel
essentially represents

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
the levels of
attainment of knowledge

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that gets you to rise
slowly ever upwards

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
towards the mind of God,
the summit, of course,

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
being the connection
or the interchange

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.093 align:middle line:84%
between the physical
and the non-physical.

00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
The way that they
communicated in the old days

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:90%
was through metaphor.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And the more we get
into the historical era,

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.515 align:middle line:84%
the more we mistake the
metaphor for reality.

00:17:48.515 --> 00:17:51.939 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.939 --> 00:17:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In one of the traditions,
Enlil just gets really annoyed

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:84%
because of the noise
humanity is making.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:90%
And that this noise is too much.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:10%
Let's just get rid of these
horrible little things.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:10%
But Enki doesn't want
to go that route.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:10%
Humanity are his creatures.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And his project is to bring
wisdom and understanding

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think
there's a beautiful--

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:19.515 align:middle line:84%
there's a beautiful message
hidden beneath that symbolism.

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Some experts like Jack Cary
believe the story of the Tower

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
of Babel is not just the
location that offered a gateway

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:84%
to the gods but a location
that humans created,

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.940 align:middle line:84%
a frequency that could
defy the current reality.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe, absolutely, that
the Tower of Babel was a center

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:84%
where humans were being
taught divine knowledge.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And chief among those
secrets was the power

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
of the spoken
word, and that they

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:84%
were being taught
a language, which

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:84%
was forbidden by the leadership
of this extraterrestrial

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.050 align:middle line:90%
intelligence to teach them.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a species that has
developed a language that

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle line:84%
is so potent that
it literally uses

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
the laws of harmonic
resonance in order

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
to create instantaneous
change in your surroundings.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
were being taught.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.860 align:middle line:10%
And it was strictly forbidden
that the leadership looked down

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:10%
and said, what, you're teaching
this invention of ours,

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.300 align:middle line:10%
how to use the most
potent weapon that we have

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:10%
which is our speech
to create change?

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:90%
How is that going to turn out?

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And this battle
between Enki and Enlil

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:84%
that are claimed to have
been in charge of the planet

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:84%
may have been the result
of why that center was

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.680 align:middle line:90%
actually destroyed.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:84%
At some point, Enlil
was very, very irritated

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.710 align:middle line:84%
with the fact that
humans, they were being

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:90%
taught all of these things.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
These secrets were all
considered to be forbidden.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Chief among those is the
secret of the language that

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.700 align:middle line:84%
allows you to create
change in reality

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
at will, the construction
of words using syllables

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that exhibit frequencies that
can literally cause a stone

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.200 align:middle line:84%
to float in midair
by speaking a word.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of power
that they possessed.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:10%
Sound causes change
in your surroundings

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.550 align:middle line:10%
because of its
natural relationship

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:10%
with the rest of creation.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
A word is no less
valuable in creation

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:90%
than a rock sitting there.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:84%
They were all created
by the same laws.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that you're
able to make a sound

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
a universal present.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it that.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:10%
It was bestowed upon
us by the creator

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.170 align:middle line:10%
of this entire universe.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though not only
is every single physical object

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
in our reality connected
with all of this,

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.790 align:middle line:84%
but yes, because we're a
creation of the same thing,

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:84%
we're able to make these
vibrations with our bodies.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And in some occult
groups they call

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:84%
them barbarous names
of incantations.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:10%
They have all of these
different sacred words

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:10%
that, supposedly, if you speak,
let's say, in a ceremony,

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.020 align:middle line:10%
it will cause a
particular kind of change.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.530 align:middle line:84%
That's tied in to this whole
idea of harmonic resonance.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies vibrate to
these same frequencies.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, our words
vibrate to the same frequencies.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's all tied together
in one big, beautiful universe.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If the humans were able
to control matter by using

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:84%
a language that
changed frequency,

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.315 align:middle line:84%
could Gobekli Tepe have been
used to harness this frequency?

00:22:00.315 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I think of Gobekli Tepe.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I think of other monuments
that were purposely buried,

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
maybe because they were
too powerful, maybe

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.350 align:middle line:84%
because the creatures that built
them didn't want us to destroy

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:90%
ourselves with that technology.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe those areas, if
you go deep enough,

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.900 align:middle line:84%
have the kind of rock
strata necessary in order

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.016 align:middle line:84%
to cause these vibrational
frequencies to occur.

00:22:27.016 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that Enki
tried to unify the ancient

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
humans through knowledge, but
in order to survive the wrath

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.280 align:middle line:84%
of Enlil, humans had to scatter
throughout the globe using

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.500 align:middle line:90%
their coded cognates?

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.960 align:middle line:10%
Are these the same
cognates that Atkinson

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.715 align:middle line:10%
has been piecing together?

00:22:44.715 --> 00:22:49.290 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at the ancient
descriptions of the Tower

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:53.970 align:middle line:10%
of Babel, for me, I look
at it as a scientist from

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.353 align:middle line:10%
the physical evidence.

00:22:55.353 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But the common theme
that weaves them together

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
when they talk
about the tower is

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.580 align:middle line:84%
that it was a
warning to humankind

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:07.161 align:middle line:90%
of our use of knowledge.

00:23:07.161 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Some experts like Jonathan
Young believe our path

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.835 align:middle line:84%
to returning to unification
is an individual journey.

00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Let me speak to
guilt for a moment,

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.190 align:middle line:10%
that leaving these paradise
stories was our fault,

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.730 align:middle line:10%
leaving the garden of Eden or
the fall of the Tower of Babel,

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.220 align:middle line:10%
that we had something good
that we messed up through

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:10%
our mistake.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:90%
This is psychotherapy 101.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:10%
This is blaming
ourselves for something

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.350 align:middle line:10%
that was larger than we were.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
To distribute people around
in different geographical

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:84%
locations with
different languages

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.390 align:middle line:84%
speaks to the diversity
of humanity and, in a way,

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.378 align:middle line:84%
is respectful that there
are many different cultures.

00:23:45.378 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:84%
This is, on an
individual level, what

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
is called the polyvocal
quality of psychology.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
We have many energies,
desires, agendas, voices.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're struggling to
pull that all together.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:90%
This is personal work.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, we have
many voices in a community

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:90%
or in nation.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
After all, there probably isn't
just one path to transcendence.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
There are as many as
there are seekers.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:middle line:90%
And this is a story of the many.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.082 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.082 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Actually, I think the
ancient Egyptians touched

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.870 align:middle line:10%
on a fundamental truth,
which is each one of us,

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.950 align:middle line:10%
every minute of every day,
are constantly making choices

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:10%
between good and evil.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:90%
They may be very small choices.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, if you're
dealing with a president

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.390 align:middle line:84%
of a major nation, that person's
choices between good and evil

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
may have huge implications
for everybody else.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:84%
But we're all playing
the same game.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
We're all having to
make those choices.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.895 align:middle line:84%
And those choices add up to
the structure of our lives.

00:24:45.895 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this structure have
been coded in our universe

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and in our language to help
us understand our purpose?

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Reporter Linda
Moulton Howe believes

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
that whatever the humans had
tapped into at Gobekli Tepe,

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.650 align:middle line:84%
they knew that they
had something powerful.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.510 align:middle line:84%
They had to hide
it and disappear.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Whoever built Gobekli Tepe,
the fact that they buried that

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:16.090 align:middle line:84%
very important 30 acres of these
rings of all of these limestone

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
columns meant something knew
that something potentially

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:84%
destructive to
the whole planet--

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that's the key-- potentially
destructive to the whole

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.462 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want
Gobekli Tepe destroyed.

00:25:34.462 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Could certain humans
have buried Gobekli Tepe

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:84%
because a bigger catastrophe was
about to happen that would wipe

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.890 align:middle line:90%
out any trace of this knowledge?

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Then comes the flood.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
The cataclysm wipes
everything out.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But that knowledge
persists through the flood.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And after the flood,
they are again

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
offering the gifts of
civilization to mankind.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next, was the flood
the next attempt to destroy

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge of the gods?
