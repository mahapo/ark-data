>> The Great Pyramid, located
on the Giza Plateau in Cairo.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:10%
In 1977, engineer
and author Chris Dunn

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.710 align:middle line:10%
began forming a
revolutionary, new hypothesis

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.110 align:middle line:10%
that this seventh
wonder of the world

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.380 align:middle line:10%
wasn't a tomb but a power plant.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Dunn's hypothesis
was that hydrogen gas

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:84%
traveled from the queen's
chamber to the king's chamber.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Then the vibrations from the
subterranean chamber energized

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
the hydrogen atoms proposed
and created a microwave energy

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:90%
beam.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
But then in 1993, his
theory got an upgrade.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:84%
A German robotics engineer,
Rudolf Gantenbrink,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
on contract to install
ventilation fans in the king's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:84%
chamber, sent a robot
down a very small shaft

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:90%
to see what he was working with.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the robot stopped
and revealed a small metal door

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:90%
with two pins.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Chris concluded that these
looked like electrodes.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The explanation
started to make sense

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:84%
to scholars, archaeologists,
engineers, and journalists

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.560 align:middle line:84%
who only seemed to connect its
existence to religious means.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at
the Great Pyramid,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.810 align:middle line:10%
especially using Chris Dunn's
Giza power plant hypothesis

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.510 align:middle line:10%
on how we see it built
like a Faraday cage,

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:10%
we see the granite,
sandstone, limestone.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.949 align:middle line:10%
It's a technology.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:10%
It's a power plant.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:10%
We see these obelisks acting
like transmitters for energy,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:10%
that I believe they
were experimenting

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:10%
with electromagnetic energy.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Electromagnetic energy?

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:84%
If Chris Dunn's theory
has weight to it,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:84%
how do the obelisks that once
graced the Giza Plateau also

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.980 align:middle line:84%
seem to support this theory,
the theory that ancients

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
were creating and
using this energy?

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:84%
For that answer, we
travel 27 miles away

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
from the Giza
Plateau, where we find

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
evidence of a great
temple buried in the sand

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.795 align:middle line:90%
and forgotten by time.

00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:52.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
East of the Nile River,
in the northern region

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
of greater Cairo, lies
the Egyptian district

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:90%
known as El Matareya.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
This location was once a
region within the ancient city

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
of Heliopolis, one of the
oldest cities of ancient Egypt.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
The only thing left
of this ancient center

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
is one obelisk that
stands as a placeholder

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
for a once-great city dedicated
to the sun and the god Ra.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:10%
An account from the time of
Ramesses III, 12th century BCE,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:10%
records that in Heliopolis,
12,963 people were employed

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:10%
just at the temple of Ra alone.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
What was so special about
this temple and the god Ra?

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle line:84%
The origin of the original
temple may be unknown,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:84%
but the Greeks
called it Heliopolis

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and revered its ancient
power by adopting its symbols

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.820 align:middle line:90%
and worship.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of these symbols
we still use today.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Experts believe that this
great city might hold

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of an unseen power.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible we might
glean from this fallen temple

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
the invisible frequency that
once graced the Giza Plateau?

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Matias suggests we must
understand the meaning

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.945 align:middle line:90%
of the sun and the god Ra.

00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>> This god was the sun, but
it was not precisely the sun

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.725 align:middle line:84%
It was also the
light of the sun.

00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
It was the vibration
that connects the soul.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:10%
In ancient times,
in Atlantean times,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.840 align:middle line:10%
we knew that
everything was mind.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.512 align:middle line:10%
And we call mind
with the sound "r."

00:04:43.512 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:10%
Rrr.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:10%
The sound "r" was the
letter for the head,

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:10%
was the letter for the
thoughts, the ideas.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.400 align:middle line:10%
And the letter A,
ah, was the sound

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:10%
for the spirit or
the falcon, the hawk

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:10%
that is in the skies, the
one that sees everything

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.050 align:middle line:10%
from above.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So the sound Ra
would be the sound

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that expressed the vision from
above and the thinking of god.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:90%
Ra was never a person.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:90%
He was never a god.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we create mistakes
in Egyptian interpretation.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Because for Egyptians,
the way they

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:84%
have to share the information
was by hieroglyphics

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:90%
and by icons.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.740 align:middle line:84%
What Egyptians did
was to understand

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that the divine was
only one, that this

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:90%
is the thought of Atlantis.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:84%
The divine is only one, like
the sun, with many rays.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So each one of the rays
has different color,

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
so different geometry,
so a different aspect,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
potential attribute.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So all the reality that
exists is just a projection

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:90%
from the light of the sun.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the potential of
the sun's energy have been

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:84%
understood through the worship
of Ra or, as Andrew Collins

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
puts it, through the largest
university in ancient times,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
a university that boasted
a resume in power?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Heliopolis is arguably not
only one of the oldest cities

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.330 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt, but it was also
the first university.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:10%
And we know that
people would come

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:10%
from all over the ancient world
to learn the Egyptian wisdom

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:10%
and knowledge at Heliopolis.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:90%
And here, also, was obelisks.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And these obelisks
were used to mark time.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.320 align:middle line:10%
Not only did their shadows
tell you the time of day,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:10%
but also the length of the
shadows of those obelisks

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:10%
told you what time
of year it was,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:10%
the time of the equinoxes,
the time of the solstices.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And this was all part of
this greater understanding

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.900 align:middle line:10%
of Egyptian wisdom
and knowledge that

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:10%
went back to the
very beginning--

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.150 align:middle line:10%
the fact that here,
at Heliopolis, you

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:10%
have this knowledge of calendars
and of cycles and of time.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course, was
something that influenced

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:90%
the whole of ancient Egypt.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
From the time of the
pyramids of Giza,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:90%
it controlled kingship, as well.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
It controlled the rituals
that the kings and the queens

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
would do and their
calendar across the year.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And in other words, everything
began at Heliopolis.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
It was seen as a
place of creation.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Even its Egyptian
name was significant.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:10%
It was Anu, which
meant the city or place

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.840 align:middle line:10%
of the pillar, the place
where it all began,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:10%
the place of the original
stone of creation,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:10%
known as the Benben.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.410 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>> The four pillars to
understand the worshipping

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:17.670 align:middle line:84%
of Ra were what we call
East, West, North, and South.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in the
North, Ra, the sun,

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:90%
the one that guides everyone.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:10%
In the South, Amun
Ra, which would be

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle line:10%
the place where we call home.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.090 align:middle line:10%
And then the Khepera, which
is the rising one, the East,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:10%
the one that is being birthed.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And the other one, Atum Ra,
which is the death and also

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:84%
the invisible, so where
the light disappears.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:84%
These four pillars
are the four aspects

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
of light, which we
used to call "ur."

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:10%
So "ur" is the physical aspect
of the consciousness, "r."

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:84%
So from this aspect
of understanding,

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians created
these four different gods

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that are the aspects of just
one god, which is the sun.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So these four aspects
were also treated

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.490 align:middle line:90%
in the vision of Atlantis.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Why were these cycles
of the sun so important?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the secrets
lay in the design

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.595 align:middle line:84%
of the structure of the temple
and its mysterious field

00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:36.395 align:middle line:90%
of obelisks.

00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:40.070 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Heliopolis was extraordinary
because it is the foundation

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:10%
stone of Egyptian culture and
Egyptian priestly culture,

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.790 align:middle line:10%
especially.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.620 align:middle line:10%
It started off
with an enclosure,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:10%
a rectangular
enclosure, upon which

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:10%
was built a structure resembling
the mathematical reduction

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:10%
of the universe.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So just that simple rectangle
was a mathematical reduction

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.300 align:middle line:84%
of everything that exists
in its most simplistic form.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And then they put a perch inside
this rectangular enclosure

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:90%
upon which sat the Bennu bird.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And over time, it became
a field of obelisks.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there was
one Arab chronicler

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that described it as
a forest of obelisks,

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
because every pharaoh
that approached

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that academy over the course of
time added their own signature.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most powerful
and potent symbols of Ra is

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:90%
the obelisk.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:10%
In ancient Egypt, the
pharaohs would always

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.390 align:middle line:10%
seek to build one of these
massive, sometimes thousand-ton

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:10%
obelisks made out
of red granite.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:10%
And they referred to them as
sun sticks or power sticks.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.920 align:middle line:10%
They could channel
the power of Ra

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:10%
into the ancient
Egyptian civilization.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Channeling power?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:10%
Could these obelisks have
been more than a symbol of Ra,

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:10%
but an actual
conductor of energy?

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:10%
>> These obelisks were
connecting energetically

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:10%
because they had metal in their
bases and water underneath

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:10%
them.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
The metal went into the water,
and the center of the obelisk

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.760 align:middle line:90%
is quartz.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And all of this was like a
giant conductor of energy.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:84%
They were like a communication
transportation symbol

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.600 align:middle line:84%
that the gods came
from the heavens

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and that these obelisks were
pointing up to the heavens,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:34.250 align:middle line:84%
bringing energy back down and
sending that energy back up.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, how would
these pillars of granite

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and quartz conduct energy?

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Physicist Nassim
Haramein suggests

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:84%
the ancients knew a
specific science that

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.910 align:middle line:84%
can only be understood by
studying the cycles of the sun.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The sun itself is a
very large energy event.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.670 align:middle line:84%
The sun in our solar
system is 99.9% the mass

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:90%
of our solar system.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:10%
All the planets put
together is not even 1%

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:10%
the mass of the sun.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:10%
And so it's a huge energy
event that we see every day.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.690 align:middle line:10%
We're far from it, so we only
get a little bit of its energy,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:10%
but we know that that
energy can be converted

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:10%
to produce very strong effects.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that in their
structures, in their temple,

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.720 align:middle line:84%
they bring in the sun
in certain orientation

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
so that they could manipulate
the sun in certain ways

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:84%
to produce what appears to
have been some energy effects.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that the
ancients used these fields

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
of obelisks made of quartz
and granite to create thermal

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.726 align:middle line:84%
energy that then transformed
into electrical energy?

00:13:04.726 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you know anything
about shape and how it

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:84%
interacts with stone, you begin
to realize that the obelisks

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.190 align:middle line:84%
are actually finely-tuned
tuning forks.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you follow the
argument that every sacred site

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the
Earth without exception

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
is built not only
on the intersecting

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
lines of the
Earth's energy grid,

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.760 align:middle line:84%
but the stones themselves are
hard-wired in a certain way

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to direct that energy in
a certain way that can now

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
be measured, the
obelisk themselves,

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
if you happen to look
at the remaining ones,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:84%
they're all
ever-so-slightly different.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Heat energy is all over us.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.920 align:middle line:84%
You can channel it
like the sun does.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And anything that receives
heat will start vibrating.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:10%
So what happens is
that it will start

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:10%
vibrating at a molecular level.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:10%
And this vibration is
the resonant frequency.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Crystals like quartz
will do the same thing,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
because these crystals
have the property

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.820 align:middle line:84%
of transferring mechanical
energy to electrical energy.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.150 align:middle line:84%
This ability of shifting
from one energy to another

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.980 align:middle line:90%
has an interesting feature.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.230 align:middle line:84%
This feature is that
the resonant frequency

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.820 align:middle line:90%
of oscillation is very constant.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> If these obelisks were
oscillating from the sun

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and creating energy, could
the metal plates and the water

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
around the obelisks
create a capacitor,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:84%
a capacitor that changed
the mechanical energy

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:90%
into electrical energy?

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This oscillation is
not self-sustaining.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
kind of storage tank,

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and that's where the
capacitor comes in.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:84%
The storage tank works in
a way that you can tune it,

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:84%
so you can find the
exact resonant frequency.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So the crystal and the
capacitor work together.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
The capacitor is an
electric component

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that stores energy
in an electric field.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
When used inside a circuit, it
will provide the stored charge

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.720 align:middle line:84%
once the electric
field is removed--

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:90%
therefore, providing current.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could the
ancients have been harnessing

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
this power and directing
it toward a source?

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you're talking
about power distribution,

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.350 align:middle line:84%
you could use cables,
metallic cables,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:84%
to extract energy or the current
from out of the capacitor

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and would deliver this power
to a distant receiver or load.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Or you could use interconnected
rods, also, along the way,

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and it would still
be a viable solution.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> But has there been any
evidence of such a system?

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.660 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, archaeologists
excavating the remains

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:84%
of a 4,500 year old Egyptian
funerary pyramid complex

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.940 align:middle line:84%
unearthed a sophisticated
copper system.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
This copper pipe was
found inside the temple

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle line:84%
closest to the pyramid, which
is called the mortuary temple.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.830 align:middle line:84%
If such pipes were used
in transferring energy,

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.190 align:middle line:84%
is it possible there were
hidden tunnels or shafts that

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.750 align:middle line:90%
were built to house them?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:84%
A full-scope investigation
beneath the Giza Plateau

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:84%
has not been
thoroughly explored.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.765 align:middle line:84%
However, this discovery
suggests that at one time,

00:16:16.765 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
a system of pipes, whether
used for drainage or energy,

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.560 align:middle line:90%
was used on the Giza Plateau.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Could the ancients have
been harnessing the energy

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.830 align:middle line:84%
from these obelisks and
sending it to other areas?

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Sonja Grace points to another
interesting connection.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The obelisks that surrounded
the temple for Ra were

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:84%
representing not only
Ra and his great power,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
but they actually were pointing
up to the heavens, to Sirius,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:84%
where he actually was
representing the sun behind

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:90%
the sun.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:84%
The rituals that were
done at the temple of Ra

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.810 align:middle line:84%
had everything to do
with worshipping the sun.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.200 align:middle line:84%
There were initiates
that were trained

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:84%
in all of the energy work
that Ra was associated

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:90%
with within the pyramids.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid has an
energetic force.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The energy goes
down into the Earth.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.880 align:middle line:84%
It takes you,
actually, to tunnels

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that are underneath the pyramid
that the ancient people built.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> For today, we
can say internet,

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:90%
that it connects us all.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
For them, it was like a
kind of technology that

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:90%
connects us with the cosmos.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a different type of
technology, of course.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's a technology that
we inherit from Sirius.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
This is why the pyramids
were built in this world.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were built
during the period of Atlantis,

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
around the era of Virgo
and the era of Leo,

00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
around 15 BC to 9,000 BC.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:84%
But the structures, the
planification of how to do that

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:90%
was built by the Sirian people.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:84%
>> If you followed the argument
that the entire Egyptian temple

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
structure was pretty
much predesigned,

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.895 align:middle line:84%
there was a blueprint
already set up, well,

00:18:17.895 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that when you
actually do look at the rising

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
of Orion's belt, if you keep
following the trajectory,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
you see Sirius rising above
the horizon at the same moment.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And that matches exactly
the position of Heliopolis,

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.030 align:middle line:90%
where it is today.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
end of the story

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
because in the ancient
world, they always

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.430 align:middle line:90%
worked in triangles.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And I always wanted
to know, where's

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:84%
the other triangle,
given what we

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:90%
have left of the Giza Plateau?

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And it took a
little bit of time.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that if
you go to one of the oldest

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:90%
mosques in old Cairo--

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and the mosques
always point to Mecca.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And the Arabs were master
mathematicians and astronomers.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:90%
They don't make mistakes.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And this one does
not point to Mecca.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:58.700 align:middle line:90%
It's 10 degrees off.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge error
by any standard.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And Mecca is not that
far away from Cairo.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty much
a straight shot.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And I figured, why would this
be not pointing to Mecca,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.930 align:middle line:84%
unless it's hiding
something under it?

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:10%
Because that was what
was done in the old days.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to
figure out that this

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
may be an inclination
as to what was going on.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that when
you put a pin on the map

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
at the Mosque of Ibn Tulun and
you put a pin on the center

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.890 align:middle line:84%
pyramid, Giza, and the
center of Heliopolis,

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
it's a perfect isosceles
triangle, and I mean perfect.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:90%


00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Have we just begun to see all
the connections this one temple

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:84%
seems to have to the
pyramids on the Giza Plateau?

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Could otherworldly beings
have connected the temple

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramids to Sirius
so that we would remember

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:90%
who designed the Giza Plateau?

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Or were they connecting the
great power of this temple

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
to the pyramids to show us
how they worked in harmony?

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Chris Dunn explains that
although the pyramids

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and the obelisks
are separated, they

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:84%
do use the Earth as part
of an oscillating system.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> To describe the
Giza power plant,

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
we go back to the source of
the energy that feeds into it.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:90%
We go to the Earth.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:90%
Energies draw through it.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And so once it's
primed, it becomes

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.715 align:middle line:90%
like a coupled oscillator.

00:20:29.715 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:10%
A coupled oscillator
is a device that's

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.790 align:middle line:10%
attached to a larger
vibrating body.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:41.890 align:middle line:10%
It's in tune or harmonically
tuned to that larger vibrating

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:10%
body.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the
vibrating body continues

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to feed energy or vibrate,
then the coupled oscillator

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:84%
will vibrate in
sympathy with it.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:90%
It will draw energy from it.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these famous obelisks
from the temple of Heliopolis

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Great Pyramid
share the same oscillation?

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The sun is the master
frequency transmitter

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:90%
of the entire solar system.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And NASA actually did recordings
of the sound of the sun,

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:90%
the actual sound of the sun.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:10%
And what NASA did is, because
you can't hear wavelengths

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.420 align:middle line:10%
that long, which
are mostly in delta,

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:10%
they squish the waves
so you could hear it.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And it makes this incredible
kind of throbbing,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.043 align:middle line:84%
pulsing sound which
you can actually hear.

00:21:32.043 --> 00:21:35.001 align:middle line:90%
[SUN PULSING]

00:21:35.001 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Now in my years of
actually calculating

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies of the Great
Pyramid as a square wave slope

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
tuner, I converted
the Great Pyramid

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
into a series of musical
notes, 10 musical notes.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I was mixing the
wavelengths of the four

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:84%
uneven sides of
the Great Pyramid,

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
they're only off by one
frequency number each.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.370 align:middle line:10%
north, south, west, east
is the firing sequence

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.110 align:middle line:10%
of the sequence of
the Great Pyramid.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:10%
And I played that
audibly, and I compared it

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.900 align:middle line:10%
to the sound of the sun.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.120 align:middle line:84%
They were resembling
each other perfectly.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.320 align:middle line:90%
And I went, oh, my god.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2018, in "The Journal
of Applied Physics,"

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:10%
scientists were able to take the
equipment to measure what was

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:32.260 align:middle line:10%
happening inside the chambers
of the Great Pyramid in Giza,

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt.

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:10%
And what they found was
that inside of the three

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:10%
primary chambers
in that pyramid,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:10%
there is an accumulation
of electromagnetic energy

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:10%
between 200 and
600-meter wavelengths.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
These are very long waves
that we're talking about.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:10%
And when they did the
imagery of the pyramid,

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:10%
you can see very clearly how
that energy is concentrated

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.190 align:middle line:10%
in the king's
chamber, the queen's

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:10%
chamber, and the subterranean
chamber, as well.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the residue from this
great technology still vibrate

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.930 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid?

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And could this theory
help us understand

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.510 align:middle line:84%
what the many obelisks in
the Temple of Heliopolis

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:90%
were used for?

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Although separated, could
the obelisks and the pyramids

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
act as transmitting devices,
possibly transmitting

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:28.200 align:middle line:90%
energy or an RF frequency?

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The shape of the pyramid and
its importance in the function

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:84%
of the power plant, it
functions like an antenna.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like transmitters and
receivers, where you have--

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
is the Great Pyramid a
transmitter or a receiver?

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It could be both, and the
same with other structures.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
system like in Egypt,

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
where you have obelisks
in certain parts

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the
pyramids in the north temples,

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.750 align:middle line:84%
in the south with the obelisks,
were they communicating back

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:90%
and forth through the ground?

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, possibly.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>> On the plateau, of course,
the enormity of the Great

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid is just almost
beyond our comprehension.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:10%
In fact, one of the
theories is that the pyramid

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:10%
was a sort of a speaker.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:10%
It was a sonic device.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.920 align:middle line:10%
And its purpose was to
get it ringing or singing

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:10%
so that it could
ultimately bathe

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:10%
all of the Egyptian civilization
in a base frequency that

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.420 align:middle line:10%
would effectively
in train everybody

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:10%
into the same
brainwave frequency

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.380 align:middle line:10%
and have everybody singing
from the same hymn sheet,

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:10%
so to speak.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever purpose this energy
was created for, it seems that

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.520 align:middle line:84%
not only do the Great Pyramids
stifle our minds with wonder,

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:84%
but, also, the symbol of
Ra is implanted deep within

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:90%
our subconscious.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.080 align:middle line:10%
His worship and science
may have been forgotten,

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:10%
but the symbol of
his great power

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:10%
seems to have not left
our current society.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:10%
It's as if we try to
understand the power

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:08.750 align:middle line:10%
by keeping the symbolism alive.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.000 align:middle line:90%


00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Ra still exists in
our contemporary mindset.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.527 align:middle line:84%
Every day, people
handle a $1 bill,

00:25:17.527 --> 00:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and they look on the
back, and there's

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:22.095 align:middle line:84%
the all-seeing eye on top
of an unfinished pyramid.

00:25:22.095 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:84%
That's actually called
the Eye of Providence,

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:90%
and that is the eye of Ra.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.650 align:middle line:84%
The Freemasons, who
designed that as the logo

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.020 align:middle line:84%
for the American
enterprise, would tell you

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:84%
that that is the
all-seeing eye of Ra.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
And we also see Ra in our
contemporary culture in movies,

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the-- one
of the most popular movies

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:84%
of all times is "Raiders
of the Lost Ark," where

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Indiana Jones holds
the staff of Ra

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and uses it to find the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So Ra is very much
in our consciousness.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We just don't think
about it all the time.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What's so interesting is
that as early as the first half

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century, Sigmund
Freud realized that there was

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:84%
some relationship
between this Aten disc,

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.740 align:middle line:84%
the representation of
the sun, and the religion

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%
of the earliest Israelites
and that, almost certainly,

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
this had come at the time
of Moses and the exodus out

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.580 align:middle line:90%
of Egypt, which he believed--

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and I think is possibly true--

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:84%
took place around the time
of the pharaoh Akhenaten.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:10%
Freud demonstrated
in writing, the Aten

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:44.730 align:middle line:10%
became Adon, as in Adoneinu,
one of the forms of Yahweh

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:10%
or the Almighty God, and that
one of the hymns of the Aten

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:10%
was so similar to one of
the psalms, Psalm 104,

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:10%
that the two had to have
come from the same psalms.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:10%
So in other words,
Ra as the Aten disc

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.710 align:middle line:10%
continued on as a
force, as an aspect

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:10%
of the Almighty God
himself being carried

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:18.230 align:middle line:10%
through Judeo-Christian and
also, obviously, Islamic

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:10%
tradition into the modern age.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, all of the
monotheistic religions of today

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.300 align:middle line:90%
still worship the god Ra.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If Ra is still being
worshipped or used to represent

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:84%
true power, is it possible the
symbol and power of the actual

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:44.160 align:middle line:84%
obelisks were also adapted
into modern culture?

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:10%
>> The people who took the
obelisk from Heliopolis

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:53.550 align:middle line:10%
and placed them in other places
did so because they believed

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.570 align:middle line:10%
that the power of the obelisk
would actually create kind

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.650 align:middle line:10%
of a magical effect of
prosperity in their areas.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.580 align:middle line:10%
And I think that came directly
from early Egyptian belief

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:10%
that these things did
help their societies.

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So these are conduits,
where you can

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.160 align:middle line:84%
collect the ambient
energy of the Earth

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and then have that
energy actually

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:90%
energize your geographic area.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.620 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Great Pyramid and
the other pyramids on the Giza

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Plateau be built to contain
and create immense amounts

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:90%
of electromagnetic energy?

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And could the many
obelisks connected

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to the temple of Heliopolis also
be built for the same reason?

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:84%
If true, might this
great symbol of Ra

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.490 align:middle line:84%
have been the source
of great power,

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.680 align:middle line:84%
a transmitter and receiver
of energy and communication?

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible then that
the connection to Sirius

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:84%
suggests a massive
infrastructure built

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:84%
on the Giza Plateau was
by otherworldly beings

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
to create a system
that would influence

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.760 align:middle line:90%
humanity through frequencies?

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Since the dawn of time,
humanity has looked

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.850 align:middle line:90%
upon the sun as the creator.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Its image morphed over time
to create such a power,

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:90%
a power we seem to have lost.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.530 align:middle line:84%
If the everyday man
were to rediscover

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.070 align:middle line:84%
the ancient knowledge and
meaning of our relationship

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to the sun, maybe
one day we, too,

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
will understand that what
we receive from this burning

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:40.130 align:middle line:84%
mass of energy millions of miles
away goes far beyond simply

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.660 align:middle line:90%
biological nourishment.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It is something that can
be harnessed and used

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.770 align:middle line:90%
to forward society.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:84%
It might just be
the invisible force

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that can change the
state of the world.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:90%
