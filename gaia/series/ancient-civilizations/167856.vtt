>> In 1937, a podiatrist named
Doc Noss discovered a cache

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
of Apache gold on what is now
the White Sands Missile Range

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:90%

Victorio Peak
while deer hunting,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Noss took refuge from a
heavy rainstorm in a cave.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Exploring, he stumbled
upon an old mine shaft

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that led him to thousands
of crudely smelted gold bars

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:90%
stacked in rows like bricks.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Tragically, Noss was never able
to cash in on this treasure

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
because whilst using
explosives in an attempt

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:84%
to widen the cave's
opening, he mistakenly

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
created a landslide that
sealed it forever more.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:84%
The legend of Noss's lost gold
gained widespread attention.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Where did the riches he had
seen come from originally?

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:84%

have come to Victorio's Peak

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:84%
to find Noss's fortune, but
none have been successful.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.920 align:middle line:10%

treasure is still

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:10%
buried somewhere in rubble
and possibly guarded

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:10%

from a lost civilization laid

buried beneath Victorio's Peak?

And if so, what else could
be beneath this strange area?

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Researchers like
Gregg Braden point out

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
that there is more to
this area than gold.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:84%
There is actually a much
more ancient system that

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.230 align:middle line:90%
stretches over four states.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:10%
>> What we found in these
areas, not so much that there is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:10%
a hollow space under the desert,
but there is a tunnel system,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:10%
a network that connects many
of the indigenous traditions

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.330 align:middle line:10%
in this part of the world
from the area in southwestern

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.880 align:middle line:10%
Colorado, northern New Mexico,
down towards Wild Horse Mesa.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And it is this natural
system of caverns

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
that the native people say many
of their traditions relate to.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So they were created naturally
through volcanic environments,

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and then they were modified
to become more useful

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.910 align:middle line:90%
over later generations.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But what the ancestors
say is that in the past,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
this is where people have lived
when the cataclysms of the past

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the
surface of the Earth.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And now, we have
physical evidence

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%
in New Mexico and Colorado.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
The geologic evidence does not
support the Hollow Earth theory

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of a complete space
in the center of the Earth.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
It does support, within
the crust itself,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:84%
a series of tunnels
and catacombs

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.200 align:middle line:84%
that were created naturally
and have been known and used

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.328 align:middle line:84%
by our ancestors, by
native peoples in the past.

00:03:34.328 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:10%
>> It's interesting that we find
this idea of treasures within

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:10%
the Earth, hidden gold, things
of this nature that actually

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:10%
tie in with Native
American lore.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you
have Chicomoztoc--

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
the seven caves, seven cities
of gold from Aztec stories.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to wonder how
much truth there is to it.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, you
had this whole idea

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that goes back to stories of
the underworld contain treasure,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the
dwarves, or it's

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
the alchemists looking for gold
in the depths of the Earth.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> These sites are very
controversial because they

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:84%
force historians to rethink
the traditional story.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Could this be true?

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Many of these underground
caverns in North America

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
are located in the
Four Corners region

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.640 align:middle line:84%
where Colorado, Utah,
Arizona, and New Mexico meet.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
This rugged and arid
geographic land,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:84%
also known as the
Colorado Plateau,

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:84%
is predominantly owned by
Native American tribes including

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:90%
the Hopi Nation.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
In Hopi folklore, it is written
that the Indians' ancestors

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
climb onto the surface of
our Earth from an underworld.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
This indigenous tribe believes
that the current incarnation

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:84%
of mankind is the fourth
world and that the prior three

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.761 align:middle line:90%
occurred inside the Earth.

00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:10%
>> What's intriguing about the
Hopi tradition is the notion

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:10%
of previous cycles of
civilization that comes across

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:10%
which are brought to
an end cataclysmically.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.740 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a
re-emergence, and another cycle

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:10%
of civilization occurs.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the message that I
take from the Hopi traditions,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:84%
that they are urging us
to cast our minds back

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:90%
into remote prehistory.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And they are saying we
are not recent comers.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:84%
We lived through a
series of cataclysms,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and we remade the Earth each
time after those cataclysms.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
actual structures

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.580 align:middle line:84%
on the ground in
that area, if you

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.018 align:middle line:84%
go to Chaco Canyon
or places like this,

00:05:39.018 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that there's the
suggestion that we're just

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:84%
looking at the tip
of the iceberg,

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and that there's a much older
heritage behind all of this.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If this, indeed, is just the
tip of the iceberg to something

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.500 align:middle line:84%
far more mysterious, what other
evidence could suggest that

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
there is an unseen
power in this area?

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva brings us to
another location in the Four

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.366 align:middle line:90%
Corners called Shiprock.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:11.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I've seen grown men weep
at the sight of Shiprock,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.140 align:middle line:10%
or if you want to call
it by its real name--

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:10%
Tsé Bit a' i.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.770 align:middle line:10%
And it's one of the most
powerful places on Earth

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:10%
for a number of reasons.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.390 align:middle line:84%
One, it's described as
a "navel of the Earth."

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And any place called
the navel of the Earth

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.120 align:middle line:84%
is essentially a power point,
as you'd expect from a navel.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.270 align:middle line:10%
And it's a place of beginning
where the Anasazi are

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:10%
said to, and I quote, "land here
from Venus on a metal bird."

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And when the bird recognized
that the people were safe,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:84%
the bird went into the ground
and rose up as Shiprock.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
You can see it for about
60 miles in any direction.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacred spot.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.258 align:middle line:90%
We should respect that.

00:06:51.258 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
few places on Earth

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.850 align:middle line:84%
where I feel I can actually hear
the braves singing and dancing

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.943 align:middle line:90%
around me and actually join in.

00:06:58.943 --> 00:07:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like the
craziest thing,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
but the energy is so
unadulterated, so powerful,

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.385 align:middle line:84%
so potent, it doesn't have
to show it, it is itself.

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And you are suddenly reminded
that you are actually

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:90%
crossing a veil.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to put into words
unless you've experienced this,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:84%
but that's the power
of a place like that.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this
"navel of the Earth"

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
be a place where people
could cross over into other

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:90%
dimensions?

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:10%
>> When it comes to exploring
Native American lore

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:10%
and, in particular, legends
about the underworld,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.240 align:middle line:10%
the Four Corners area is
particularly important

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:10%
because we have a number of
Native American groups that

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.300 align:middle line:10%
claim to have emerged there.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean
they have an emergence

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:84%
myth that says that they
came out of the Earth.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.970 align:middle line:84%
The Pueblo people
believed that they

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.890 align:middle line:84%
had come out of the
Earth in that area

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.660 align:middle line:90%
around the Grand Canyon area.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
We have the Hopi who
claim they came out

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.130 align:middle line:84%
of what they call the
sipapu, which is basically

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
the name for a hole as part of
their chimney system in a kiva.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But they claim that they
had come in something

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.932 align:middle line:90%
they called the sipapu.

00:08:00.932 --> 00:08:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And they came out
of the underworld

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
where they had interacted with
reptilian humanoids called

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.272 align:middle line:84%
the Snake People and
the Lizard People.

00:08:07.272 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And they had also interacted
with another group

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:90%
called the Ant People.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The Ant People are
described, basically,

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
in a way that sounds very much
like so-called descriptions

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.220 align:middle line:90%
of modern day gray aliens.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:84%
We have this whole idea here
that there's a series of worlds

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
beneath, and they all have
their own inhabitants,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and that these Native
American people said

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
they had come up through
these various regions

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:84%
to eventually
emerge in our world.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:84%
We have the Apache who
have a similar legend that

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:84%
says they came through a
series of caverns to our world

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
after they lived in a place
called the Old Fire Land, which

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:84%
had been destroyed
in the cataclysm

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and had sunk beneath the ocean.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And they claim that
they had come here

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:84%
through a series of caverns
just as the Aztecs said.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:90%
We also have the Navajo.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And the Navajo believe that
they came out of the underworld

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.415 align:middle line:84%
So these are themes that all
tie into the Four Corners area.

00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting
that the various people--

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.600 align:middle line:84%
some of them were even
adversaries in previous

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.643 align:middle line:90%
centuries--

00:09:06.643 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:84%
that they all have
similar legends

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.622 align:middle line:90%
about worlds within our world.

00:09:11.622 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>> If the premise that modern
mankind originated from caverns

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.210 align:middle line:84%
deep below the Earth is true,
then is it also possible that

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.140 align:middle line:84%
there are entire civilizations
still living underground

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.831 align:middle line:90%
in the Four Corners region?

00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I live near Taos, New Mexico.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:10%
And there is a phenomenon that
is called the Hum, the "Taos

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:10%
Hum," H-U-M. It is a vibration
that is felt, selectively,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:10%
by some people.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:10%
Other people don't
seem to know it at all.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.240 align:middle line:84%
It usually happens between 2
and 4 AM when a lot of people

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:90%
are sleeping.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And the hum, it's
right on the verge

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
of where you feel
it in your heart

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and where you can just
below the audible level.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows where
this hum is coming from.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
They brought in university
researchers back in the 1980s

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:90%
to try to triangulate where.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.442 align:middle line:84%
If they could find
three locations

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:84%
where they found the
hum and triangulate,

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.275 align:middle line:90%
they could find the source.

00:10:12.275 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was that
it's coming from everywhere,

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that there
is a vibration happening

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.630 align:middle line:84%
within the Earth during
those periods of time--

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:90%
2, 3, 4 AM--

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
that is being carried
through the bedrock

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:90%
into these other areas.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
What is the source
of that vibration?

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:10%
This is where the
speculation comes in

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:10%
that these natural
tunnels and the caves

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.720 align:middle line:10%
and the caverns that our
ancestors have talked

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:10%
about in the past
that already exist

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:10%
are being modified, perhaps, and
used in modern ways for storage

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:10%
for Earth-sensing, geo-sensing
applications, and things

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So that is where scientific
community kind of has arrived

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:90%
is that there is something.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And they think maybe it is the
drilling, the constant drilling

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.250 align:middle line:84%
to modify these caverns
that's creating the vibration.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Since 1946, the US government
has been using Hopi land

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
in the Four Corners region
for explosive testing.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that, in fact,
these tests are a cover-up?

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Could the military be
using the ancient power

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:84%
of this area to run
covert military programs?

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Or could their true agenda
be to destroy something

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:84%
that was discovered
underground, perhaps something

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:90%
from an ancient galaxy?

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Billy Carson entails
his personal encounter

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:90%
at the Four Corners area.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It appears that a lot of
this activity in a lot of these

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.000 align:middle line:84%
tunnels congregate close
to this Four Corners area.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.702 align:middle line:10%
Now, there's well-known
stone-based stargates is

00:11:53.702 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:10%
what the ancient
Indians call them,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:10%
and now the modern
Indians say the same.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:84%
These are where
their relatives used

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
to go and put their heads in
and actually chant some words

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:90%
and disappear.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And then some of
them were returned.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Last summer, I went to Arizona
to see the Grand Canyon.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.045 align:middle line:84%
We actually hired a helicopter
and a guy to go down there,

00:12:10.045 --> 00:12:11.420 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted
to find out if I

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:84%
can see any of these
ancient mysteries

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.033 align:middle line:84%
that people have
been talking about.

00:12:15.033 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And we landed on this
Indian reservation

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:90%
down inside the canyon.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.685 align:middle line:84%
And there's a special
area that was corded off.

00:12:20.685 --> 00:12:23.060 align:middle line:84%
So I said to the guy, I said,
why can't I come over here?

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't understand.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't see anything dangerous.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
He said because NASA has taken
over this part of the Canyon.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:10%
The way the grid system
runs across the Earth,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.410 align:middle line:10%
there are several
places that are just

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.480 align:middle line:10%
like heavily energetic nodes.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:10%
You'll find on many
of these reservations,

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:10%
and other holy lands
held by Natives,

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.450 align:middle line:10%
that military
groups have gone in

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:10%
and built facilities and
made them off limits.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, these
are actual entrances

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:84%
to this cavern system that
honeycombs the entire Earth.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these places
are sacred to natives

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:84%
because they have
stories going back

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
many millennia of different
types of beings taking them

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
below the Earth before
cataclysms to protect them.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.928 align:middle line:84%
And these are the same things
that after the cataclysm

00:13:02.928 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
would bring them back to
the surface of the Earth

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
to help them set up their
civilizations again.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these areas that
the military will lock down

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
are also very strong
vortexes, which,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:84%
basically, are nodes in this
cosmic web stargate system.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
These are places that
the military locked down

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.587 align:middle line:84%
because they don't want you
to see what's coming and going

00:13:20.587 --> 00:13:22.415 align:middle line:90%
through these gates.

00:13:22.415 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> A lockdown?

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, who
or what could possibly

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
be traveling through these
gates or in these underground

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:90%
caverns?

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we should
consider one of the less

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:36.960 align:middle line:84%
conventional theories
of evolution.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.830 align:middle line:84%
If it is possible that
the DNA of human beings

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:44.030 align:middle line:84%
was originally bioengineered
by ancient extraterrestrials,

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.130 align:middle line:90%
could this be a link?

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.470 align:middle line:84%
William Bramley points
out how this idea

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:90%
is explained in Hopi folklore.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:10%
>> You have this possibility
at least within the lore.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:10%
You don't necessarily exclude
sky-born gods from gods that

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.150 align:middle line:10%
lived underground because
people had both ideas--

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:10%
that the gods had realms
underground, underwater,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:10%
and in the sky, and they
interacted with all of them.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
We already know there were very
large caverns here and there.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
It may be, for example,
that the South American

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
tribe, maybe the Hopi maybe,
they found some of these

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:90%
at one time.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Or, at least, they
found caverns big enough

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
where they believe that some of
these things could transpire.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily
a contradiction.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It just means that
the gods operated

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.765 align:middle line:90%
in these different realms.

00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at the
creation stories of our past,

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.240 align:middle line:10%
as different as they
are from one another,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:10%
there are common themes that
weave them all together.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I find this fascinating because
it is the local understanding

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.360 align:middle line:84%
of a common heritage,
I believe, that

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:84%
is preserved in the traditions
of the modern indigenous

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:90%
peoples.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the most obvious
of these common threads

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
is the theme of another
world beneath this one,

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:84%
a subterranean world from
which our ancestors emerged.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of these themes from
Native American folklore have

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
found their way into modern day
accounts of what I call modern

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:84%
folklore, which would be
ufology, cryptozoology,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.270 align:middle line:84%
all these types of things,
conspiracy literature.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Really, all this stuff is
just an update of folklore.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.992 align:middle line:10%
It's the same stuff that
people have done for centuries.

00:15:29.992 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, it contains truth.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.020 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, it
contains fabrications.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people
elaborate on what

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.950 align:middle line:90%
they think something means.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But we see these
ideas of underworlds

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
involved with a variety of
peoples around the world.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, emerging in these same
areas, all these things

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.910 align:middle line:84%
touch on the same
type of material.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> With these subterranean
creation stories of the world

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.570 align:middle line:84%
from which our ancestors
emerged, is there, perhaps,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
a code or a treasure that could
have been left for us to figure

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:84%
out the truth of humanity's
connections to the Four

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.816 align:middle line:90%
Corners?

00:16:09.816 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> New Mexico, Arizona, the
whole area around the Four

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Corners, and Utah, of course,
and southern Colorado,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:84%
it's actually one of the
most spiritually active parts

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:90%
of North America.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And this is why that
part of the Americas so--

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.935 align:middle line:10%
it draws so many people.

00:16:23.935 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:10%
Some of them might know it.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:10%
Some of them don't.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.930 align:middle line:10%
But they are drawn
there, nevertheless.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I think it's because
the land is worked with.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:90%
The land is a living organism.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
If you work with it, just
like watering a plant,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.420 align:middle line:90%
it gives you something back.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:10%
It gives you back
a certain pleasure,

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:10%
and that's what
you're attracted to.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's why that
part of the country

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:84%
is so important, because
it's still alive.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
It's worked with
on a daily basis.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel that as
you just drive through it.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.720 align:middle line:90%
There is the Navajo sites.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:90%
There is Mesa Verde as well.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
There is Bandelier.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a kiva up
on Bandelier that's

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:84%
if you happen to go there
at the end of the day,

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and time it so you don't get
caught up inside the park,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
you have to climb up
a 100-foot ladder.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:10%
And that place is
perfectly positioned

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.660 align:middle line:10%
inside the natural cave
in a really awkward area

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:10%
of the park, because
that's the one

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.944 align:middle line:10%
spot where the Earth's telluric
currents just happen to cross.

00:17:17.944 --> 00:17:19.319 align:middle line:84%
You know, and
they're everywhere.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:90%
These currents are everywhere.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But they built this
sacred site exactly where

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.780 align:middle line:90%
those currents cross.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And you go inside
the kiva, and you

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
had this out-of-body
experience, because this energy

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.770 align:middle line:84%
is made it the same
stuff that we're made of.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:84%
It's literally just
giving you a means

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
of technology in which to
escape the physical world

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and connect to another
level of reality.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Gregg Braden takes us
deep into another structure

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:84%
in the Four Corners area that
may give us an insight into how

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:84%
this location connects to the
sky and what may lie below.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the greatest mysteries
that we're finding of ancient

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.112 align:middle line:84%
civilization is right
in our own backyard,

00:17:58.112 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:84%
for those of us that live
in the United States,

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
in the high deserts of
northern New Mexico--

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Chaco Canyon.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:10%
Something happened
in Chaco Canyon

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:10%
1,100 plus years ago
that we have never

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:10%
seen in the history
of the world before,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.950 align:middle line:10%
and we never saw it
duplicated since that time.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:84%
We still do not
know precisely who

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.530 align:middle line:84%
the people were that built Chaco
Canyon, where they came from,

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:23.320 align:middle line:84%
why they had the advanced
technology, why they had

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%
the mathematics, why
they had the astronomy,

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
the architecture, the ability
to grow food in one of the most

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:90%
harshest environments.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:10%
It's 12 miles long, 2
miles wide in some places.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:10%
Within the canyon itself, there
over 2,800 archaeological sites

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:10%
that have been recognized.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Of those 2,800, 32
have been excavated.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And because they
cannot be sustained,

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:84%
many of them were reburied
to preserve them for later

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:90%
generations.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:10%
12 are now restored,
and it's those 12

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.090 align:middle line:10%
that are telling the
story that is opening

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:10%
the door to forbidden
territory when

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.710 align:middle line:10%
it comes to archaeology,
advanced civilizations

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.210 align:middle line:10%
of our past.

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
One of the most notable
places in Chaco Canyon

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:90%
is Pueblo Bonito.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
It is a very unique D-shaped
architectural complex.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Over 900 rooms were built
into this Pueblo Bonito.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are square.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are the
circular chambers,

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.310 align:middle line:84%
the kivas that play
such a significant role

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in the traditions of the Native
peoples throughout the desert

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.040 align:middle line:90%
southwest.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons that
this circular chamber is

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
so important is because
it ties directly

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:90%
into their creation story.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
In the circular
chambers, in the kivas,

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
there is a place at one end
of the cave called the sipapu.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And the sipapu, in
the Native traditions,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
is where our ancestors from the
past emerged from another world

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:90%
beneath this world.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.580 align:middle line:84%
They emerge into this
world time and time again.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
This ties in beautifully to
some of the creation stories

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that we find
everywhere from Sumeria

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
to the Mesoamerican
traditions in the Yucatan.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.352 align:middle line:84%
There is a common
theme that runs

00:20:13.352 --> 00:20:14.560 align:middle line:90%
through all of these stories.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And that common theme
is that the people

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.080 align:middle line:84%
emerge from a world
that is underneath.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:84%
It is below the world
that we know now.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this yet another reference
to human creation beneath

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:90%
the surface?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.135 align:middle line:84%
What might be Chaco Canyon's
connection to the stars?

00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When the Viking missions
began sending back the images

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:84%
from Mars, over 19,000 images
from the orbiter as it was

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.970 align:middle line:90%
circling.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And as those images
now have been refined,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and we have a better sense of
what they are, lo and behold,

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:55.760 align:middle line:84%
there is on the surface
of Mars a temple complex

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:84%
that looks precisely like
an unexcavated Pueblo

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Bonito in Chaco Canyon, a
very unique D-shaped structure

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.435 align:middle line:84%
that we find nowhere else
on this planet in the past.

00:21:06.435 --> 00:21:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing that we
find contemporary.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
The only other place we find
an example of the structure

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:90%
is on the surface of Mars.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, the people of Chaco Canyon,
we don't know, as I mentioned,

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:90%
precisely who they are.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
they had an advanced

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
understanding of physics, of
astronomy, and mathematics.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a place in Chaco,
a 400-foot-tall butte

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.350 align:middle line:90%
called Fajada Butte.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And at the top of Fajada Butte
is a mysterious structure

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.635 align:middle line:84%
that scientists are now calling
the North American Stonehenge.

00:21:40.635 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, you wouldn't
necessarily know

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
that to look at it because there
are three vertical slabs made

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:84%
of the same material
as the native Earth.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.340 align:middle line:84%
In the 1970s, it was
recognized that on the solstice

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and on the equinox, the way the
sun comes and the light shines

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.620 align:middle line:84%
through these slabs
against a spiral design

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:84%
on the wall at the
back of the slabs,

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
it actually pinpoints
precisely the summer

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.630 align:middle line:84%
solstice and the equinox
as well as lunar cycles.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And this was something that
has never been seen before.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:10%
It's so rare that
scientists were

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:10%
reluctant to even embrace
the possibility that it

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:10%
was actually happening.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:10%
And it was only when
laser-guided imagery

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:39.050 align:middle line:10%
was used to mimic the
solstices and the equinoxes

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:10%
at different times of year that
science were able to pinpoint

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:10%
precisely that,
yes, this is what

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.866 align:middle line:10%
was happening on Fajada Butte.

00:22:48.866 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Four Corners area
hold some kind of power beneath

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.330 align:middle line:84%
the Earth that humans
might have emerged from,

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.450 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that the
inhabitants of Chaco Canyon

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:84%
built these locations to connect
with an ancient space-faring

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:90%
race beyond Earth?

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>> What the scientists found
was that from Chaco Canyon were

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.550 align:middle line:84%
a series of roads that radiate
in perfect lines from Chaco

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:84%
into other archaeological sites
like Hovenweep and Mesa Verde,

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, and the
Aztec National Monument.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:10%
Perfect lines,
perfect roads, when

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:10%
they reached a rock or a boulder
in the middle of the road,

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.630 align:middle line:10%
they didn't go around,
they went right up over.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:33.940 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely perfect.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason
this is a mystery

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
is because these
people had no wheels.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.180 align:middle line:84%
What were they using-- a perfect
road, absolutely straight,

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.880 align:middle line:84%
36-inches wide with no
wheels in their culture--

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
what were they using
these roads for?

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the mysteries
that the scientists

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:10%
are looking at now, because it
appears that Chaco was never

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:10%
inhabited to the full extent
that it could have been.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:10%
It had the ability to sustain
thousands and thousands

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.830 align:middle line:10%
of people, but
there's no evidence

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:10%
that those thousands of
people ever lived there.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So now, the thinking is
that it was a gathering

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:84%
place during very
specific times that

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.060 align:middle line:84%
were predicted and calculated
by Fajada Butte where

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:84%
people from the other traditions
would converge on Chaco using

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.730 align:middle line:90%
these roads.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And many of the astronomical
images that we're seeing now

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.260 align:middle line:84%
link Chaco to what we
see happening in Venus,

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.580 align:middle line:90%
what we see happening on Mars.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:10%
So it's very possible that what
we're seeing in Chaco Canyon

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.810 align:middle line:10%
is an example of an
advanced technology using

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:10%
the materials that are
available in this world

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:10%
to mimic and
duplicate a knowledge

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:10%
and a wisdom that has been known
from somewhere in the past.

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Could Chaco Canyon be
mimicking something more

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:90%
ancient than we know today?

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins suggests
that the ancient people

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:84%
were following a pathway
of the skies that

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:90%
would lead them home.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
these ancient people

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:84%
had a different understanding
of their existence here?

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The soul comes
from, let's say,

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
the sky world up there somewhere
and returns there at the point

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.520 align:middle line:90%
of death.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:10%
But there's something
more beyond that,

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:10%
that some part of us comes
from the stars themselves.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And that the point of
incarnation, that something--

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:84%
we call it the soul
or the spirit--

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:84%
embodies within flesh
and blood and exists.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And that this gives
us this connection

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.120 align:middle line:84%
to the stars that the
soul or spirit actually

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:57.500 align:middle line:84%
comes from an extraterrestrial
or a starry source.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And that when we're released
at the point of death,

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.150 align:middle line:84%
it goes back from
whence it came.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.810 align:middle line:90%


00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:84%
But in connection with
this were various stars

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that were seen as
personification of influences

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and intelligences that were
either markers on that route

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.660 align:middle line:84%
to reach the sky world
or helped or enabled

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:28.820 align:middle line:84%
the soul as supernatural
beings to achieve that aim.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be
a consistent route,

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and that route would seem
to have been symbolically,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:40.080 align:middle line:84%
at least, and maybe in
actuality in some manner,

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
connected with the Milky
Way, what we can see

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:90%
of the edge of the Milky Way--

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.580 align:middle line:84%
this bright, beautiful,
starry stream

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that comes up from the
horizon, arches over our heads,

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
down to the other horizon,
something that we barely

00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:84%
perceive today living
in urban environments,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.580 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:10%
But if you go to remote parts
of the world in its totality.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's beautiful.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.760 align:middle line:10%
And you don't understand
just how important

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:10%
this would have been
to our ancestors

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.630 align:middle line:10%
seeing something like this
rising up into the sky.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And the ancestors believed
that this was the route.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:84%
They called it the
"path of souls"

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:90%
in Native American tradition.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> If these ancient people
did have this knowledge,

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:84%
how is this connected to
what might lie below the Four

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Corners?

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Breakaway civilizations
or things of that nature,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.960 align:middle line:84%
the ancient civilizations
like pre-Adamites.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:10%
You know, if these
beings created

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:10%
a high level of civilization
before we did and may,

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:10%
long ago, have reached
quantum computing levels

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.980 align:middle line:10%
even using the crystaline
structure of the Earth itself

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.010 align:middle line:10%
to achieve godlike powers.

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And hence, they
became "the gods"

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:55.510 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of ancient people.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.783 align:middle line:10%
So when you look at
these ancient beings that

00:27:59.783 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:10%
are described in
the ancient text,

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.360 align:middle line:10%
and you look at the
modern-day UFO accounts,

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:10%
you're probably really
looking at the same beings.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.978 align:middle line:84%
But that does not
mean that they're

00:28:06.978 --> 00:28:09.415 align:middle line:90%
coming from across the galaxy.

00:28:09.415 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a good bit of
evidence that the Earth

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:84%
has been bombarded
by various cataclysms

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
over the ages, everything
from asteroid impact

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.875 align:middle line:90%
to solar events.

00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:84%
When these things
happen, civilizations

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.103 align:middle line:84%
that might be on the surface
are going to be devastated.

00:28:23.103 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
way around this.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you don't
know it's coming,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.350 align:middle line:84%
then the effect on
your civilization

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.740 align:middle line:90%
is going to be catastrophic.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:84%
We find this again
and again in stories

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:36.430 align:middle line:84%
about these ancient beings who
preceded us here on the planet

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and who may still
actually be here.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.580 align:middle line:10%
Richard Shaver, who is
the creator of something

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:10%
called the Shaver
Mystery, he said

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.550 align:middle line:10%
that these beings
fled underground

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.250 align:middle line:10%
when the radiation coming
from the sun became so deadly.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, before, they lived
for thousands of years,

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.280 align:middle line:84%
they quickly found that
their solar radiation

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.800 align:middle line:90%
was destroying their DNA.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And then they fled beneath
the surface of the Earth.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And they and their descendants,
in a greatly modified form

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:84%
due to other types
of radiation which

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.452 align:middle line:84%
were found inside the Earth,
are still there to this day.

00:29:08.452 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say
that you wouldn't

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:14.330 align:middle line:84%
have to have a really
advanced level of not just

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:16.330 align:middle line:84%
civilization, but
technology in order

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.740 align:middle line:84%
to carve out a space inside
the crust of the planet

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.113 align:middle line:84%
and to make a sustainable
environment there.

00:29:21.113 --> 00:29:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, there
are elements there

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.145 align:middle line:90%
that which could provide this.

00:29:24.145 --> 00:29:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Sonja Grace uses her
alternative research to dive

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:84%
even deeper into the
layers of the Four Corners.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So I went back in time and
spirit-traveled to an ancient

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:84%
site that my guides took
me to called Chaco Canyon.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.690 align:middle line:84%
It's in the Four Corners
of the Southwest.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:10%
The Savrock immediately
ushered us in inside the rocks.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:10%
There was like an opening,
and we went inside.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we want to show
you this because this is what

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:90%
happened to the Anasazi people.

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We took them through
this underground tunnel.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And we literally
returned the people

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:84%
that we could to the
very place that they

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:84%
began before they
migrated north,

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.910 align:middle line:90%
which was to the Mayan culture.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:18.580 align:middle line:84%
The Savrock helped the Mayan
people long time before that.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.720 align:middle line:84%
The whole migration
story of the Hopis

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:84%
where they migrated
in four directions

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:84%
came out of an ancient
culture down in Mexico.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And this was very
interesting that the Savrock

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.820 align:middle line:84%
would intervene and help
some of these people

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.490 align:middle line:90%
back to this place.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.680 align:middle line:84%
It's how they
actually disappeared.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.670 align:middle line:84%
The rest of them disappeared
because the Annunaki also

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.900 align:middle line:84%
came and took several of these
people, hundreds of them,

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:90%
from the Anasazi community.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.470 align:middle line:84%
This site and all
of the Southwest

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:59.290 align:middle line:90%
is filled with portals.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of energy
going on there, especially

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial energy.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.575 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
energy in the Southwest.

00:31:09.575 --> 00:31:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be that what Doc
Noss apparently stumbled across

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:16.660 align:middle line:84%
was ancient treasure from
some of these cultures as they

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:90%
survived cataclysms?

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
Four Corners area holds

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:84%
a certain kind of
energy that opens up

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.290 align:middle line:90%
doorways to other worlds?

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, how are Mayans
and ancient cultures in Mexico

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.550 align:middle line:84%
attached to this area in
the American Southwest?

>> The foundation of
the Aztec nation, now,

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:40.660 align:middle line:84%
that location was
known as Chicomoztoc.

That means the seven
caves, and this

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:49.090 align:middle line:84%
was like some kind of
subterranean structure.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:10%
One of them has them coming
from a place called Atzlán.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And this is suggested
to be somewhere

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.601 align:middle line:90%
in the Southwest United States.

Corners be linked to more
