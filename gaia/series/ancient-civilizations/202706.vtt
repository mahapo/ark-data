>> The Great Pyramid, the
seventh wonder of the world.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:84%
This enigmatic structure
located within the Giza Plateau

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
is aligned in perfect
precision with its two smaller

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:84%
sister pyramids,
Khafre and Menkaure,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and associated
paramedical structures.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.350 align:middle line:84%
But why were the pyramids
built, and in this formation?

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Could unraveling the shape
and building materials

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids shed
light on their usage

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:10%
Researchers have attempted
to answer these questions

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:10%
with archaeological and
anthropological evidence.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
But could they be
missing the full picture?

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
As Leonardo da Vinci
once said, nature

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
is the source of
all true knowledge.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:10%
She has her own
logic, her own laws.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.280 align:middle line:84%
She has no effect without
cause, nor invention

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
without necessity.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Recent studies have
brought to the surface

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:84%
some interesting results
regarding our consciousness,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of the planet,
and the energy that seems

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.555 align:middle line:90%
to radiate from a pyramid.

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the
six simultaneous cradles

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, one of the
common themes that we see run

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
through each of these
civilizations is the shape

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid associated with
the stars, with the cosmos.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.500 align:middle line:10%
Scientifically, it's
only been in recent years

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:10%
that we've had the technology
to actually answer the question,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:10%
does the shape of a pyramid--

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:10%
three-sided,
four-sided, five-sided--

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:10%
in some way influence
or interact with energy

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:10%
in our world?

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Pyramid energy is something
that's been discussed by many,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:10%
many researchers,
experimented on.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:10%
They've detected frequencies
in different pyramids.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:10%
And you could very well by just
slightly altering the shape

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramid, also alter
the frequency of what's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:10%
being emitted out of it.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have to say
there is an effect.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, the question
is did our ancestors

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:90%
know that that effect was there?

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Was it intentional?

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, this goes to
the question, what

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:84%
is the purpose of the
pyramids themselves?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And were they all built
using the same technology?

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever this
technology might be,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.010 align:middle line:84%
one thing that seems constant
in these ancient pyramids around

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:84%
the world is the
building materials.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Andrew Collins has a theory
that connects the stones

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:84%
to the pyramids to
our human brain.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:10%
>> The answer, I believe,
is to do with geometry.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.990 align:middle line:10%
Because the so-called perfect
pyramid, like we see at Giza,

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.210 align:middle line:10%
is only one half
of an octahedron.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The other half of it would be
buried into the ground itself.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It reflects this sacred and
otherworldly geometry, which

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.240 align:middle line:90%
is found within nitrate itself.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:84%
There are many crystals that
take the form of a octahedron.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
case, then there

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
must be some kind of
resonance between the shape

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid and crystals
that also take the same form

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:90%
and human consciousness as well.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:90%
So how might that work?

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is that one
of the minerals that has

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
an octahedral form is hematite.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%
Hematite is iron oxide.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And not only is it
found in natural form

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
within nature, within rocks,
but it's also inside our heads.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.420 align:middle line:84%
There are countless
tiny hematite crystals

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that contain within them
the form of the octahedron.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
So there is a resonance from our
head from human consciousness,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:84%
from the human brain
through the shape

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:84%
of the crystals to the shape
of the pyramids themselves.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a instant
transfer of information

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.150 align:middle line:90%
across any distance.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And this works through
the absolute exactness

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:90%
of these particles.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And if they are in the form
of an octahedron or a pyramid,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that means that our brains
resonate with the pyramid shape

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, whatever
is going on inside of pyramids

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.450 align:middle line:84%
can actually resonate
with human consciousness

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.070 align:middle line:84%
and affect us in a
very deep cosmic way.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> This hematite can be
found in most granite--

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
granite blocks like those
used in the building

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Could it be possible that
8,000 tons of granite

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
was used in the
construction because

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
of the properties
of this mineral

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and how it affects
the human brain?

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But there is yet another
mineral found in granite

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that interestingly enough has
been discovered in human brain

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:90%
tissue.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is magnetite.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:10%
Freddy Silva explains the
importance of magnetite

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:10%
and its connection
to neurobiology.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Magnetite is also something
that flows through the human

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.830 align:middle line:10%
body.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.827 align:middle line:10%
And it allows it to orient
itself to the magnetic grid.

00:06:17.827 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, you put these
two ideas together,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.452 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize that
the buildings were also

00:06:21.452 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:84%
built to influence the
person that goes inside.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And that, in effect,
also affects the person

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.160 align:middle line:90%
that walks into the building.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
essentially geometry.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
All our cells,
everything is geometry.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So a person in their
right sense of attunement

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
will go into the
right kind of pyramid,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.410 align:middle line:84%
because all the angles are
all slightly different,

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and they all induce different
psychological effects.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:84%
You go into a building
and you are influenced

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.710 align:middle line:84%
by the shape of the
geometry of that building,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
but also the type of stone
and the amount of stone.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember, all that
stone, and all that magnetite,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and all that quartz creates
a pH electrical effect.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So shape, pH
electrical effect, you

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:84%
create an electrical
environment.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And the one person
that benefits most

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
from these alterations
in frequency

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
is the human body and its
state of consciousness.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, it's the shape
and the correct use of stone

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that's derived from the
observation of natural laws

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.623 align:middle line:84%
that has a profound
effect on the individual.

00:07:18.623 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, is it
possible that pyramids across

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:84%
the world are created to
harness a unique frequency based

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
on their structure?

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Could this structure then
have a profound effect

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
on our human bodies
and consciousness?

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
This begs the question, could
all the pyramids in the world

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:84%
be slightly different
for a reason?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Maria Wheatley describes
a certain anomaly pyramid

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
on the Giza Plateau that
has baffled scientists

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:90%
and archaeologists for years.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:10%
This might be evidence
that, indeed, each pyramid

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:10%
on the planet is created
to hold a different energy

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.080 align:middle line:10%
for a certain reason.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The bent pyramid is
an enigma to most people.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:90%
What an odd shape.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Why build a pyramid like that?

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids of Egypt
neutralize one great system

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.220 align:middle line:90%
called the Hartmann-grid.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.270 align:middle line:84%
The Hartmann-grid aligns
North, South, East, West.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And you find the
edges of a pyramid

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:84%
are always on that plan
of the Hartmann-grid.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:10%
So that anchors it into the
ground to a certain degree.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:10%
Now with a bent
pyramid, it's believed

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:10%
by numerous researchers
that a slight kink

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.059 align:middle line:10%
in the shape of a pyramid
softens and neutralizes

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.380 align:middle line:10%
the negative green.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:84%
The bent pyramid was
skillfully made like that

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
so it manipulates the
colors of the Earth

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:90%
and the colors of the sun.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Now if you have a
pyramid at home yourself,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.560 align:middle line:84%
you're supposed to make it have
a little notch on the bottom,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.200 align:middle line:84%
because a big
pyramid that comes up

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.020 align:middle line:84%
like that generates too much
energy of the negative green.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:10%
>> According to scientific
studies in the Dowsing

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.000 align:middle line:10%
community, and a
book published by Dr.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:10%
Karim titled "Back To
A Future For Mankind",

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:10%
negative green is part of 12
energy qualities that can be

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:10%
measured in waves.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:10%
It is shown here
as the color gray.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:10%
Negative green has
a horizontal wave

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:10%
which is beneficial to human
health and a vertical wave

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:10%
which is harmful
to human health.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Harmful negative green
waves can be picked up today

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:84%
as EMF and other toxic
Earth energies that create

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:90%
negative effects in our bodies.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
There are places, such as the
beach, and, yes, even pyramids,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that include beneficial
horizontal waves

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:90%
of negative green.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
The ancient people
knew that if they

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
were able to balance the
vertical negative green

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
into horizontal, it would be
a powerful healing and growth

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:90%
tool.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>> If you imagine a pyramid can
irrigate the area with fertile

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
energy, with healing energy,
with beneficial energy,

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
then you have a kind of healing
irrigation system that is being

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:84%
utilized particular
times of the day.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:10%
>> If the pyramid technology
was based off the building

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:10%
materials used, and the
angles of its structure,

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:10%
then could it be possible that
the pyramids main function

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:10%
on the planet was to emit
certain frequencies that would

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:10%
affect the human mind and
body in a positive way.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Could it also be affecting
the planet in a positive way?

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.810 align:middle line:84%
In order to answer
these questions,

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
we travel 30 miles
outside Tomsk,

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.870 align:middle line:84%
in the vast Russian
province of Siberia.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
It is here, on May 11,
Russian engineer Valery Uvarov

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.340 align:middle line:84%
broke ground on
a pyramid complex

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:84%
using the techniques and the
wisdom from ancient cultures

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.895 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> What Dr. Urarov has
recorded, I believe,

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
are electromagnetic anomalies
and effects as a result of him

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:19.050 align:middle line:84%
constructing a perfect
pyramid in a virgin landscape

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be affecting
the natural geomagnetic fields

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.760 align:middle line:90%
of that particular area.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And what this does is
to prove once again

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:84%
how powerful that symbol
of the pyramid actually is.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Through his long-term study
of ancient pyramids from all

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:84%
over the world, ancient
texts and scientific research

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:84%
into the effects of the
pyramidal field on living

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and inanimate nature, Valery
Uvarov prepared the basis

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
for the construction of
his Siberian pyramid.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:10%
Unlike ancient pyramids,
this experimental pyramid

00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:10%
is monolithic, made of concrete
containing white quartz sand.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Standing at 13.5 meters
tall, a precise height

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.950 align:middle line:84%
that was derived from the
dimensions of creator Valery

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Uvarov.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Not only does Uvarov's
pyramid recreate the structure

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
configurations and alignment
to celestial bodies,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
like those of pyramid designs
from ancient civilizations,

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:84%
but this experimental
creation also

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.440 align:middle line:84%
contains the following
features-- a four level

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
resonator chamber system,
a three level system

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
of water reservoirs, and
also a tapered channel

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
running from top to bottom
along the central axis

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid for
water concentration

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:90%
counter flowing energy flows.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The top or chief
cornerstone of the pyramid

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.050 align:middle line:84%
is formed by a
quartz pyramidion.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Beneath this point,
there also lies

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.990 align:middle line:84%
what Uvarov describes as
a system of special energy

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:90%
sources.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:10%
>> General pyramid complex
consists of nine pyramids.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:10%
But at the corner
of this square area,

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.810 align:middle line:10%
there are four special pyramids.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
It's two giant pyramids
which are forming octahedron.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Inside of these
octahedrons, there

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:84%
are so-called
energetical sources.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:10%
I came to an understanding
that all these minerals,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:10%
they have a very special
effect on human being,

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.960 align:middle line:10%
on human energetical structure.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:10%
They have used a very limited
quantity of minerals-- minerals

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:10%
having very special capacities
like quartz, like bauxite,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:10%
for example.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Why they have used white
color, black color, red color?

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Because instead of the pyramid
there is grains of a red color.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>> A larger pyramid on the
property becomes the focus

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:90%
of this experiment.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:10%
>> The big pyramid in
Tomsk, it is concrete.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:10%
And it's done with
special design.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
They put a lot of crystals
inside this concrete.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So it was done
with special ideas.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And a very big crystal from
Brazil they put in the top.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Huge, huge crystal.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And there are four levels.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Here at the complex
for the first time Dr.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin Korotkov, professor
of physics, biophysics,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and medicine, has decided to
test the effects of the large

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
pyramid here on water
and the human body.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Measurements were taken on
a device called Bio-Well.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> About 25 years ago, I
invented the instrument that is

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
known now in the world as
Gas Discharge Visualization.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Now, we name it as Bio-Well.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Bio-Well is a especially
instrument to measure energy.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
We have two modes
of measurement.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:90%
One mode is measuring people.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.150 align:middle line:84%
For people, we are
measuring light coming

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.560 align:middle line:84%
from their fingers in
electromagnetic field.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And light, this is
frequency, this wave.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Photon, it's at the same
time particle and a wave.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So we are measuring
frequency of just photons.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
For this instrument,
for Bio-Well,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I developed a special sensor.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:90%
The name is sputnik sensor.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It's measuring standing
electromagnetic waves

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:90%
propagating in space.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And this sensor, we are using
to study the environment.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.385 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, we
learned about the energy

00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:90%
of environment.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
We sent in space very short
electromagnetic waves.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And propagation of those waves
depends on impedance of space.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So in different places,
in different areas,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:90%
we have a different signal.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:84%
One way information can
come, where we have walls,

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:84%
we have ceiling, we have people
around, it will be one signal.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.492 align:middle line:84%
As we're around it by
measuring somewhere outside,

00:16:07.492 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:84%
hopefully a totally
different signal.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:10%
And for us, it's very
important to see the amplitude

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:10%
of a signal and its variation.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:90%
We have raised parameters.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:84%
We calculated them in
special algorithms.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And this way, we are able to see
whether this particular place

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
is quite stable
or is it variable

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and what the frequency,
what the variation,

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:90%
of this particular space.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we understand
whether this place is good,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.592 align:middle line:84%
for example, for life or it's
good for something particular.

00:16:41.592 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Konstantin prepares the
device specifically for several

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.940 align:middle line:84%
different experiments they
plan to do in this unique large

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:90%
pyramid.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> We did several measurements.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
First was to measure
energy of the environment

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
inside the pyramid in different
levels, outside the pyramid,

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:84%
comparing with the energy
in the hotel, which

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
is maybe about 15
kilometers from the pyramid.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's practically
the same area.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.904 align:middle line:84%
Next experiment
was I was putting

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
the sensor inside the pyramid
and left it there for two days.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Konstantin's first
results were that of testing

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
the pyramid itself.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It is interesting
that at level four,

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:84%
the highest level
of the pyramid,

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
energy was higher
than in the hotel,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
while in the level
one and three,

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:84%
it was the same energy as
in the hotel, no difference.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:84%
But at level two,
the energy was lower.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, I've
done a measurement

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:90%
outside the pyramid.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And that was a big
difference, huge difference.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:10%
So near the pyramid,
the level of energy

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:10%
was very high, very,
very high, much higher

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:10%
then inside the pyramid and
much higher than in the hotel.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:10%
So it is absolutely clear for
me that outside the pyramid,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:10%
we have an increase of energy.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So being outside of
the pyramid, it's

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:84%
really very good for health,
it increases your energy,

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very
stimulating effect.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So it means that the
pyramid places its own field

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:90%
around itself.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The next experiment
was testing with water.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And here, we glean some
interesting results, as well.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Here, I have five
bottles of water.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:10%
Those are absolutely
equal bottles

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:10%
that we bought in
the same store.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:10%
So it's one of the
same types of water.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:10%
They're all sealed,
and it is full.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:10%
We leave one bottle
here in the hotel.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:10%
And four bottles, we'll
take to the pyramid.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
We place them in different
levels of the pyramid.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And then tomorrow, after they
will stay in there for a day

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:90%
and night, we'll collect them.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I will check this
with our instrument back here.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is for us to see
whether the pyramid really

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:90%
has some influence to water.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Would it be possible to measure
this influence if it is?

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:90%
So what was found?

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:10%
On the level one and level
two, the energy of water

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:10%
was much lower
than in the hotel,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:10%
much, much lower, while on
the level three and four,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.660 align:middle line:10%
it was much higher than
level one and level two.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.930 align:middle line:10%
We had the highest influence
to water on the level three.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And as a parameter was
frequency of water.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So again, at the
level four and three,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.200 align:middle line:84%
the frequency was
much more balanced,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
while on the level
two, it was much more

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:90%
chaotic than at the hotel.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's
confirmation that

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.810 align:middle line:84%
level four and level
three of the pyramid,

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
they are stimulating, while
level one and level two,

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:90%
they are depressing.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So the more near you are to the
top, the higher the influence.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> After his initial study of
the pyramid's energy fields,

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Konstantin then moved on to the
study of energy-related effects

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:90%
on human subjects.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Here is how the
experiment was conducted

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:90%
and the ensuing results.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> We did tests with two people,
two apparently healthy men,

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:90%
strong guys.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.320 align:middle line:90%
So their energy was very good.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I've done their measurements
with Bio-Well in the hotel.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:84%
We take measurements
from all 10 fingers.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Then we came by
car to the pyramid.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:84%
People came inside
the pyramid, and they

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:84%
were staying inside the pyramid
on the level two for one hour.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Then I repeated the measurement
inside the pyramid with them.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And coming back to
the hotel later,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.920 align:middle line:90%
I was able to see results.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And the results were
absolutely clear.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But unlike the water
experiment and the pyramid

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
itself, the human results
were quite different.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:10%
>> For both of them, it was
a drop of energy in place

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:41.770 align:middle line:10%
of stress.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:10%
Even Valery, he was the
constructor of this pyramid.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.500 align:middle line:84%
He knew this pyramid, and he
was there many, many times.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But still, this was
an objective effect.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And you see in the hotel,
your energy was 61 joules--

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.600 align:middle line:90%
in the pyramid, 48.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.040 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's one
more confirmation

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
that inside the pyramid,
you don't feel very healthy.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be there
inside for a long time.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And I had the same effect
under the Teotihuacan pyramids,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.760 align:middle line:84%
in different pyramids
in different countries.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was one
more confirmation.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> With such interesting
results from these tests,

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that the
pyramids were designed to create

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:36.430 align:middle line:84%
beneficial frequencies outside
the pyramids for humans,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:90%
not inside?

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.170 align:middle line:10%
Or could it be likely
that only some pyramids

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:45.910 align:middle line:10%
are designed for humans to be
inside for beneficial reasons?

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> My idea is that
Cheops Pyramid,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:84%
as many other big pyramids,
it was not designed for people

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:90%
to be inside.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not a building.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not a palace.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It is a very special
construction,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:04.240 align:middle line:84%
but a pyramid has a
tremendously stimulating effect

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:90%
on everything being outside.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So it was told to us that
everything grows much faster

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.630 align:middle line:90%
around a pyramid.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.280 align:middle line:84%
All vegetation is
much greener, and they

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.500 align:middle line:84%
become green in the spring
before any other vegetation

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:90%
around there.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So we had many
experiments of this kind

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
in different countries that
demonstrate that pyramids

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.570 align:middle line:84%
really have very
stimulating effects

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:90%
on all life around them.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was confirmed
by our methods.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Could this be evidence
that pyramids were constructed

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.640 align:middle line:10%
in ancient time with the purpose
of generating a powerful effect

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:10%
on the human body?

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe they were created
to have the ability

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
to have an effect on the Earth's
energy around the human body

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
of the planet.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:06.480 align:middle line:84%
If this is the case, where
did this technology come from?

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that all those
pyramids were designed by some

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:84%
previous civilizations
unknown to us.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But we have a lot of evidence
that those civilizations

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
existed before known
to our civilization.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The pyramids are not
something from this world.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids are something that
connects many civilizations

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.040 align:middle line:84%
in different worlds
of this galaxy,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
because the pyramids
are a construction that

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:84%
represents the geometry of
creation brought to matter.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So for many other
cultures, the pyramids

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
represent the place where you
could be inside a sphere, where

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:84%
you could be yourself
the nucleus, the core,

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:90%
of your own planet.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:10%
So it's a technology to
connect with the spirit,

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:04.890 align:middle line:10%
to connect with the
mind of the cosmos.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So each planet has its own
way to create the pyramids.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.300 align:middle line:84%
But during the
period of Atlantis,

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
many pyramids were
built. And this

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
is because they understood
their role as the seeders

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.040 align:middle line:90%
of this consciousness.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
become the planet.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to become
the universe itself.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.990 align:middle line:10%
It's a technology
that we inherited

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:10%
from Sirius and some other
worlds, like Vega and Arcturus,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.250 align:middle line:10%
maybe, but they were different.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:10%
The structures, the
buildings, were different.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:10%
So this is why the
minerals, crystals,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:48.530 align:middle line:10%
the silica from the stones that
the pyramids are made of, they

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:10%
by the correct vibration
helped us to restore

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:10%
the images of the
universe, because we are

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.600 align:middle line:10%
a universe in different shapes.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So we can remember from
where our particles came

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:84%
from just if they are aligned
to the same vibration.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:84%

the meaning of their existence.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Could a combination
of the minerals

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.120 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramids
are made of and

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:84%
their certain
geometric structures

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:84%
speak to us on a
frequency we are just

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.680 align:middle line:90%
now just understanding?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And do the experiments
that were done in Siberia

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.500 align:middle line:90%
suggest that this might be true?

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Could these devices be not
for humans to reside in,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.730 align:middle line:84%
but more for humans
to reside around,

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
an ancient device built to
harmonize these frequencies

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:54.740 align:middle line:84%

to pioneer new
