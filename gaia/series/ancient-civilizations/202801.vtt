00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Approximately 150 miles from
the North Korean border lies

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:90%
the Chinese province of Jilin.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It is here at an ancient
burial site known as Houtaomuga

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:84%
that researchers excavated 25
human skeletons dating back

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to between 5,000 and
12,000 years ago.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
The researchers were
intrigued with their findings.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:84%
These skulls of
long-dead individuals

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
were elongated far beyond
what is considered normal

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:90%
for average Homo sapiens.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
They also represented some
of the oldest known examples

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.050 align:middle line:84%
of intentionally reshaping
the bones in the human head

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:90%
to form this conical shape.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The skulls found
at Houtaomuga,

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:90%
China are interesting.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the first
archaeological site where

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
they can judge just
how long that practice

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:90%
had been going on.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:10%
So some of the Houtaomuga
skulls dated as far back

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.690 align:middle line:10%
as 12,000 years ago, all the
way up to 5,000 years ago.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.870 align:middle line:10%
And so that spanned
a 7,000-year period.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:10%
>> And of course,
when this happens,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:10%
if you look at
these individuals,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:10%
they're going to look strikingly
different to everybody else.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And these particular
elongated heads date

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
between 5,000 years ago, all the
way back to 12,000 years ago.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
And this is quite incredible.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:10%
Because this shows
that this process

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:10%
was going on at this early date.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:10%
And this is at the very
end of the last ice age.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:10%
So what are these
elongated heads?

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:10%
Why did they do this?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:10%
What do we know
about this process?

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:10%
Which, it must be pointed
out, is not unique to China.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It's something that has
gone on all over the world--

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Americas, in the Eurasian
continent, and in Africa.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.500 align:middle line:90%
It's there everywhere.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.010 align:middle line:10%
>> The origin of the dragon
emperors and the dragon people

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:10%
of China goes back,
again, to about 8500 BC,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:10%
which is around the time period
we're talking about here,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.060 align:middle line:10%
of this group of gods that
survived the catastrophic

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:10%
flood.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:10%
And they arrived in specific
hot spots around the world

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:10%
to kick start civilization.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:10%
Because it's always
been suggested,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:10%
how did humans spontaneously
discover civilization

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:10%
all at once, all around
the world at the same time?

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So in 8500 BC in China,
we have the establishment

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
of the dragon people
or the serpent people,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.080 align:middle line:90%
as they were also called.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were the two
gods that basically

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
had the group of
seven other gods

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:84%
with whom they brought
the civilization

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
to that part of the world.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And they're described as
very tall, long headed.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was their
genetic bloodline

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that eventually
becomes the dragon

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:84%
bloodline of the
dragon emperors, which

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%
we know so much about.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the historic
records throughout Egypt,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and the highlands
of central China,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and the monasteries of
Tibet as well as Mesoamerica

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and into Peru, what we find
is that in ancient times,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
the beings with the
elongated heads had very,

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:90%
very mystical powers.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.220 align:middle line:84%
They were able to do things
that typical humans could not.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:10%
They were able to
heal very quickly

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:10%
and heal the bodies
of other people.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:10%
They were able to understand
time in a very different way,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:10%
and see into the future,
and see into the past.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to access information

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
in ways that the average person
appeared could not do easily.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> If these elongated headed
beings had mystical powers

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:84%
and abilities beyond
the human species,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:84%
could these strange skulls come
from a completely different

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:90%
species on this planet?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> People with elongated skulls
literally inhabited the entire

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.238 align:middle line:84%
And no matter where
you go on the planet,

00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle line:84%
you will find remnants of
elongated skulls or people

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:84%
that used to have
elongated skulls.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of evidence
has been left behind

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.683 align:middle line:10%
that they traveled
and circumnavigated

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:10%
the entire planet.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:10%
They may have even
been interplanetary.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could these
elongated headed beings have

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
come from the stars
to give us knowledge?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Another location
provides more evidence--

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Malta, the three-island
archipelago

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
Mediterranean Sea.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:10%
It was here in the heart
of these islands that these

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:10%
ancient people built the
world's only known pre-historic

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:10%
subterranean temple--

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:10%
the Hal Saflieni Hypogeum.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:10%
Within the lower chambers
of the temple's necropolis,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.170 align:middle line:10%
archaeologist
Themistocles Zammit

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:10%
discovered thousands of skeletal
remains during the early 1900s,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:10%
their skulls elongated.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The origin of these remains
has never been determined.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Only recently have
these skulls undergone

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.248 align:middle line:90%
thorough scientific study.

00:05:38.248 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:10%
>> This is what makes it so
unique is the fact that you

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.390 align:middle line:10%
have these above-ground temples,
and you have a surrogate

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:10%
temple, which is its mirror
image under the ground.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.440 align:middle line:10%
It's unique in the world.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was called
the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was unique, because when
he started digging the insides

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
of these 33 chambers
on three levels--

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.240 align:middle line:84%
that's a hell of a lot of
digging that was done--

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
he found something
like 11,000 bodies

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
in there-- skeletons
that have all

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
been thrown in there
very unceremoniously

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.040 align:middle line:84%
as though a massive
tidal wave had

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.770 align:middle line:84%
taken over the islands, which
is exactly what happened.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So he found all these
bodies in there.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And much to his
amazement, a lot of them--

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and there's over a thousand of
them-- were elongated skulls.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And they're unusual.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.100 align:middle line:84%
A part of the fossa
medium was missing.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And also, the sagittal
suture was also not there,

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:84%
as you'd find that little crack
that's in the human skull.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So something was
different about these skulls.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was realized that they
represented an elite group,

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
people who were different to the
many other thousands of skulls.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:90%
So who were these elites?

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Although, certainly,
they were the people

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
in charge of the
engineering projects

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:84%
that were going on, on the
island of Malta itself.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:10%
most assuredly, they had
different genetic backgrounds.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:90%
But who were they?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:90%
And where did they come from?

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the elongated heads
found in Malta give more

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:84%
evidence that the elongated
heads were not only a different

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:84%
species, but maybe not
even from this planet?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where context
becomes so important.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Because if we look
only at the skulls,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:84%
we may never be able
to solve the mystery.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:84%
But what the context of
the people in the area

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:84%
tell us through their written
records, through the artifacts,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
through the oral traditions
is that humans have always had

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:90%
a relationship with the cosmos.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.910 align:middle line:90%
We have a family in the stars.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And those that have come
to us throughout history,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:84%
various times in history, in
times of need when humankind

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.970 align:middle line:84%
faced some of the greatest
challenges and crises of war

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:90%
and climate in the past--

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.550 align:middle line:84%
famine-- it is these beings
with the elongated skulls that

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
came and brought
food, such as quinoa

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:90%
to the people of the Andes.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:90%
They brought wisdom of peace.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They brought the ability to
heal when diseases ravaged

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:90%
throughout these populations.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And they all associate these
extraordinary experiences

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:90%
with our family from the stars.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>> If these beings did
come from the stars,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:90%
why did they come to Earth?

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> When you analyze and look
at some of these ancient texts,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
you'd start to discover
that there's the potential

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
for an ancient galactic war that
occurred in the Pleiades star

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:41.710 align:middle line:90%
cluster.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.648 align:middle line:84%
And you had the Lyrans
and the Sirians.

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And some of the depictions
of them-- they had elongated

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:90%
skulls.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:10%
But either way, when you look
at the record of people coming

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.275 align:middle line:10%
from other places to Earth, they
seem to have elongated skulls.

00:08:52.275 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:10%
Or the ancient people, at
least, have depicted them

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:10%
as having these large,
elongated skulls.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> This isn't the first planet
that this race has visited.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
These interdimensional
beings-- they guide often.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
They guide the
different planets.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And they bring in
a lot of knowledge.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.550 align:middle line:90%
They are the knowledge keepers.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.220 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
These beings-- and they have
such a mass consciousness.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:10%
And they have a mass
amount of knowledge that's

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:10%
beyond time, that's infinite.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:10%
And they travel from
planet to planet,

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:10%
bringing this information
and instilling it

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:10%
into the consciousness
of any new planet

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:10%
that there is within
specific solar systems.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> If these beings were
installing a new consciousness,

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
could there be remnants of
them also in ancient Egypt,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.520 align:middle line:84%
where many secrets of the gods
and their power are carved

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:90%
into the walls of temples?

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:10%
The most famous
elongated heads depicted

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:10%
throughout Egyptian
history is a pharaoh

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:10%
of Egypt, Akhenaten, and his
Queen Nefertiti, and later,

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:10%
King Tut.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm really intrigued by the
elongated skulls that we find

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:10%
throughout history and
depictions of beings with

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:10%
elongated skulls.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:10%
In particular, I'm fascinated
by Akhenaten and his children.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Akhenaten is considered the
heretic king in ancient Egypt

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.410 align:middle line:90%
about 1400 BC.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.233 align:middle line:84%
He's originally portrayed as
a normal-looking human being.

00:10:21.233 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But then suddenly,
the Egyptians started

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:84%
portraying him with what is
clearly an elongated skull.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And his children have
elongated skulls.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And it fascinates
me to wonder, well,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
why did they suddenly
start doing that?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
What is the ultimate
meaning of that?

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists dismiss it as
some kind of a genetic condition

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that he suffered from that
was passed on to his children.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not so sure about that.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:84%
For me, the answer comes from
looking at the metaphysics

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:90%
that Akhenaten introduced.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.240 align:middle line:84%
He introduced
monotheism to the world.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
He fired the whole pantheon
of ancient Egyptian gods

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and introduced the
worship of the Aton, which

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:90%
he called the disc.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And people, especially
Egyptologists,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:84%
say that Akhenaten
worshipped the sun.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And the disc
represented the sun.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:84%
But Akhenaten said no, that the
Aton symbolized or represented

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.640 align:middle line:84%
the light that
illuminated the sun.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about that.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:84%
That is a giant leap
in consciousness

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:90%
that he's introducing.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And he passed this teaching
on to his children as well.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Is there a correspondence
between this giant leap

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness
that he introduced

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps a heightened or
a greater cranial capacity

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
that he might have
actually possessed

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and his children
could have possessed?

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
We're told by researchers
of elongated skulls

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that the cranial
capacity could be

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
two and a half times that
of an ordinary human being.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Just think of what you
could do consciousness wise

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
if you have a cranial
capacity two and a half times

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:90%
what you have right now.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And what if Akhenaten, indeed,
had this cranial capacity

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and he's introducing this
super advanced metaphysics that

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:90%
actually changed the world?

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> If these beings came to Earth
to help the human population,

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
is it possible their species
could be linked to the human

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:90%
lineage at all?

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.630 align:middle line:84%
There is yet one more
place in the world

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that holds a high concentration
of elongated heads.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to the
dry desert location,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
the remains of the elongated
heads have not been destroyed.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:10%
Paracus, a desert
peninsula located

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:10%
within the Pisco province of
the southern coast of Peru--

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.500 align:middle line:10%
it is here where Peruvian
archaeologist Julio Tello

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:10%
made an amazing discovery in
1928, an elaborate burial site

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:10%
containing tombs, containing
hundreds of ancient remains.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Tello and fellow
archaeologists at the time

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.880 align:middle line:84%
were amazed to learn these
bodies possessed the largest

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
elongated skulls found
anywhere in the world

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and have come to be known
as the Paracus skulls.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.020 align:middle line:84%
In total, Tello
found more than 300

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:84%
of these elongated
skulls, some of which date

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:90%
back around 3,000 years.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's where
the mystery begins.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:10%
Because when we look
at the physical skulls

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:10%
that we find in southern
Peru, in places like Paracus,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.510 align:middle line:10%
for example, what we find
is that these skulls do not

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.830 align:middle line:10%
look like typical human skulls
before they are deformed.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Researcher Jack Cary
points to some of the skulls

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:84%
discovered and shows that they
are completely different from

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:90%
any other human skull.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Paracus skulls
are interesting,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.410 align:middle line:84%
because they're missing
the sagittal suture.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And they have one
parietal plate.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
They seem to all express
genetic features that we

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:90%
don't see in normal humans.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:10%
So the difference between
the fossa major found

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:10%
in the one skulls is genetic.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:10%
And it has to do with
the type of ridge that's

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:10%
running through the
top plate of the skull

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:10%
and almost makes it flatter.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The Paracus skulls were
missing the sagittal suture,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
which is where you could
connect the two parietal plates

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:90%
of the human skull.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So in either case, those
are genetic traits.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not caused by
ritual head binding.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2018, several Paracus
skulls received DNA testing

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.740 align:middle line:84%
from geneticist William Brown
and scientist Nassim Haramein.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Carbon dating was performed
on the skulls upon arrival.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And ancient DNA
extraction was performed

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:36.310 align:middle line:10%
with the UCLA Center for
Genomic & Bioinformatics lab.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
By early 2019, they started
analyzing the whole genome.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:10%
>> We were able to receive
samples from two elongated

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:54.050 align:middle line:10%
skulls from the Paracus in Peru.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.950 align:middle line:10%
They were amazingly
well preserved.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:10%
I saw that they had hair
that was still present.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.750 align:middle line:10%
They had soft tissues
that were still present.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:10%
And from my initial
estimation, they

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:10%
looked like, perhaps,
400 years old at a max.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:10%
When we did radiocarbon
dating of them,

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:10%
they came out at 2,000-plus
years old, 2,200 years old,

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.580 align:middle line:10%
one 2,400 years before present.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.890 align:middle line:10%
We performed analysis
on the skull volume,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:10%
the size of the skulls
as compared to humans.

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
The skulls had a larger
volume than human skulls.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:84%
The sutures where the
two plates of a cranium--

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
the cranial skull
come together--

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:84%
were different in
the elongated skulls.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We have preliminary results
from the testing we've done.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:10%
And it appears to have
some anomalies that

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:10%
are very interesting.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:10%
Certainly being in
contact with these skulls,

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:10%
and seeing them, and doing even
just a general analysis of them

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:10%
is definitely remarkable.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.800 align:middle line:10%
Some of the anomalies that
we're finding in the testing

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:10%
is making us think
that they could

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:30.080 align:middle line:10%
be different species, at least,
than the Homo sapien sapien.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:10%
>> The genetic
testing is ongoing.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:10%
But the first results shows a
large amount of gene variation

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.990 align:middle line:10%
relative to the 1,000 human
reference genome, which

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:10%
indicates either non-random
changes in the DNA

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:10%
or a high degree of genetic
divergence from Homo sapiens.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But the latest results
are even more fascinating.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Analysis was done with a
John Hopkins deep sequencing

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:90%
genomics core.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And it shows that, surprisingly,
there are no alignment

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
or matches to the
human reference genome.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
William Brown explains
what they discovered

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and why it possibly
connects an ancient lineage.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We've traced this interesting
lineage and anomalous results

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
for the mother's side of these
two remains of these elongated

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.500 align:middle line:90%
skulls.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.050 align:middle line:84%
We traced the
mitochondrial genome

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
of these two elongated
skulls to the haplogroup

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:84%
that most closely compares
to the mitochondrial DNA

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:90%
of the two elongated skulls--

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.230 align:middle line:84%
is in the Black Sea
region of Central Asia.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:84%
This particular haplogroup
is most strongly represented

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
in this region
around the Black Sea.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.700 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Because in that region,
you find elongated skulls.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:10%
It's very unusual,
because in South America,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:10%
you very rarely or never find
that particular mitochondrial

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:10%
haplotype.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.770 align:middle line:10%
But these elongated skulls--

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:10%
that's where they match to.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:10%
We can say that the mother has
a human mitochondrial genome.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But even that is
almost borderline.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Because if you were to
randomly sample any two people,

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
they would have about
20 to 26 changes

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in the DNA sequence against
a human reference genome.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:10%
These skulls-- the
mitochondrial genome

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.770 align:middle line:10%
for them had upwards of 50
single nucleotide variants,

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:10%
so more than double
the amount you normally

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:10%
see in the human
population anywhere.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:84%
So the mitochondrial
DNA, the mother's side

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:00.790 align:middle line:84%
is not closely related to
any extant human populations

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If DNA sequencing of these
ancient beings found anomalies

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.520 align:middle line:84%
relating to the mother,
were investigations

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:84%
into the father's Y chromosome
as equally anomalous?

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:10%
>> What you have is a Y
chromosome that is not matching

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:10%
to the human reference
genome Y chromosome,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.985 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that the father
was not Homo sapien.

00:19:27.985 --> 00:19:30.560 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And if that was the case,
it would go a long way

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
in explaining why we detected
such a high degree of variation

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of the genome.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Because there's variation
coming from a not entirely Homo

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:54.060 align:middle line:90%
sapien father.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the anomalies present
in the DNA tests reflective

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:90%
of another species of humanoid?

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Or is it possible that some
kind of genetic tampering

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:07.650 align:middle line:84%
has taken place within
this ancient civilization?

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
>> If it's a kind of mutation
that you don't naturally see,

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that means it's suggestive
that the changes were directed

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.620 align:middle line:90%
by an intelligent agent.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:10%
I could produce that
kind of ratio changes

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:10%
by directly engineering
or influencing

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.240 align:middle line:10%
the genome of an organism.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> These results obtained
from the Paracus skulls are

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:84%
an astounding discovery,
yet they are not unique.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.910 align:middle line:84%
In 2017, Gaia led the charge
of an analysis and testing

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.360 align:middle line:84%
of several mummified
bodies recovered in Peru.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Maria-- the name given
to a female humanoid

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:84%
with an elongated skull, was
found in this same Paracus

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:90%
region.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:10%
After testing and
DNA sequencing,

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:10%
it was determined
that Maria, too,

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:10%
did not match any known
human genome on the planet.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The DNA analysis for Maria
had a 20% matching homology

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:90%
to the human reference genome.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what we saw
with the Y chromosome

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:90%
for the elongated skulls.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the father
looked more like Maria.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
That would be an agreement with
the similarity between only 20%

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
matches up with the
human reference genome,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:84%
just like what was
seen with Maria.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could there
be a connection with Maria

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:90%
and the other elongated heads?

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Matias De Stefano,
who claims the ability

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
to recall past lives
via a connection

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.820 align:middle line:84%
to the Akashic
records, remembers

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.820 align:middle line:84%
that Maria looks like
a species from Sirius,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
but from a different part than
the other elongated heads.

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:10%
>> The being that
I've seen you--

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:10%
you have found in
Paracus in Peru.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Like many of the
skulls that are there

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
in Ica and all that
region, they usually

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
came from the south of
the world that I remember.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:84%
In the south, the people
were smaller, tiny

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
tallest that we were

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
in the central and the
north of the world.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:10%
And they also have less fingers.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:10%
So for sure, the being
that was discovered

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:10%
was from the south of Gludok.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And for sure, when I'd
been in Ica, in Peru

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and I have seen
the skulls, I could

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.480 align:middle line:84%
tell that there were mostly
humans trying to imitate them.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But there were two of them, that
they were from Gludok, not only

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:84%
by seeing the skull,
but also by feeling.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:09.130 align:middle line:84%
The way in which I
remember them is because I

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
used to be one of them.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And I remember how it was to be
one of them since I was a kid.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I remember them from a planet
that we used to call Gludok.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And there were three main
different races of our people,

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.810 align:middle line:84%
that my race was 2
meters and a half high.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
ones that were smaller.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.260 align:middle line:10%
But the main characteristic
was that we had three brains--

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:10%
two to balance the reality in
the third-dimensional worlds

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:10%
and the other one to
connect with the realities

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:10%
beyond the third dimension like
the fourth and fifth dimension.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
The brain that we had allowed
us to vibrate the information.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.420 align:middle line:84%
So we were not much people
that used to talk, not

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:90%
talkative people at all.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:84%
This took us to be one of
the species from Sirius

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
or close by Sirius that went
to every one of the planets

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.330 align:middle line:90%
that we're trying to evolve.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.310 align:middle line:84%
We're in the process
of evolution.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And we were the ones
seeding the information,

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:84%
the seeders of the projects
that would become those worlds.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So this is why some
people in this planet

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:48.520 align:middle line:84%
used to call this
species gods that

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.330 align:middle line:84%
came from the skies, other ones
like the masters, other ones

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:57.820 align:middle line:84%
like the architects, because
we came here to teach.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these architects have
come to teach not only from

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Sirius, but from
other star systems?

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible there is a link
between all of these locations

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and the elongated skulls
that have been found?

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> All the pyramids in
the world are aligned.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And they work for different
kind of constellations.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:25.600 align:middle line:84%
If you see the pyramids of
China, the pyramids of Egypt,

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramids of
Peru, what you will find

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
is that the Earth is reflecting
the portals of Pleiades, Orion,

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:90%
and Sirius.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
If you see the
sky, you will find

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.320 align:middle line:84%
that if you see the three stars
of Orion's portal, at your left

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:84%
you will have the
stars of Sirius.

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:55.900 align:middle line:10%
At your right, you will
find the stars of Pleiades.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.940 align:middle line:10%
So when you see this
structure and you print it

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:10%
into the Earth, you will find
China pyramids, Egypt pyramids,

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:10%
and Peruvian pyramids.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:10%
So the whole planet can hold the
frequency of the biggest portal

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:10%
towards the spiritual self
in China, towards the biggest

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:10%
portal of every dimension
in Egypt and then in Peru,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:10%
the order of the being and the
order of the confederation.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I knew that my people would
go and come constantly

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.710 align:middle line:84%
to this planet to
make the settlements,

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to make the download
of information

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:90%
through pyramids, namely.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
For us, that kind
of architecture

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:84%
represented the seats,
represented the seats

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:90%
of all the dimensions together.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is why this species used
to be all along this planet.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Because for us, this
planet was an opportunity

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:08.570 align:middle line:84%
like a greenhouse where we could
put all the seeds together.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Were beings from the Sirius
star system and other star

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:84%
systems an ancient progenitor
race that helped to seed

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:90%
and guide humanity?

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible these beings
have been deities worshipped

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:84%
by ancient civilizations
all over the world?

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:84%
The desire for people
of the old world

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to ritualistically bind
the skulls of their young

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:90%
may point to this possibility.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Ongoing research into
anomalous DNA sampled

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.280 align:middle line:84%
from elongated skulls
excavated from ancient sites,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
the world over,
continues to this day,

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
suggesting there could have been
intermingling of Homo sapien

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:50.060 align:middle line:90%
sapiens and these beings.

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.830 align:middle line:84%
This exciting
research may one day

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
reveal humanity's origins
to be far more complex

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and challenging than our
current understanding.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Could these elongated
skulls provide some answers

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.540 align:middle line:84%
to humanity's ongoing search
for our origins on this planet?

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.890 align:middle line:90%
