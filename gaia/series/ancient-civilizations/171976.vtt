as a very significant migration
from Aztlan to central Mexico.

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.903 align:middle line:84%

the tribes that we know today--

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:13.508 align:middle line:84%
so the Anasazi, the Hopi,
the Navajo, the Aztec, who

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:15.344 align:middle line:90%
then became the Meshika.

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.279 align:middle line:90%
into different areas?

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.365 align:middle line:84%
The legend of the
Aztecs suggests

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:39.868 align:middle line:84%
that their people began their
journey from a red canyon

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:90%
with four rivers.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.877 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Cecilio Orozco of California
State University, Fresno

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:53.382 align:middle line:84%
set out to confirm the
actual location of Aztlan.

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:57.386 align:middle line:84%
On March 24, 1990,
Dr. Orozco published

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.805 align:middle line:90%
an astonishing conclusion.

00:02:59.805 --> 00:03:02.474 align:middle line:84%
By cross-referencing the
description of the land where

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:07.229 align:middle line:84%
the Mexica came from, Orozco was
able to pinpoint the location

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.147 align:middle line:90%
of their homeland--

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:12.818 align:middle line:84%
Utah, more
specifically, the Four

00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:16.655 align:middle line:84%
Corners region, where the
borders of Utah, Arizona,

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Colorado and New
Mexico all converge.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.495 align:middle line:84%
>> He came across a
glyph that was a dead-on,

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.748 align:middle line:84%
perfect representation of
an Aztec glyph that he knew

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.584 align:middle line:84%
of that contained a
mathematical code.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:33.463 align:middle line:84%
And that mathematical code
alludes to the Venusian cycle,

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.798 align:middle line:90%
the cycle of Venus.

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Because of that, he decided
that the Four Corners area

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.889 align:middle line:90%
must be their place of origin.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.893 align:middle line:84%
The Nahua people, which is
where the Aztecs came from,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.856 align:middle line:84%
also claim that they came from a
place of the four great waters.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:55.235 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the Four Corner region,
you have the four great waters.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.029 align:middle line:84%
You have the Green River
coming out of Wyoming,

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:02.909 align:middle line:84%
the Colorado River coming out
of Colorado, the San Juan River.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
With the three main
rivers and the mixing

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.414 align:middle line:84%
together, that's the
four great waters

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.708 align:middle line:90%
that they were discussing.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> When people started trying to
understand what was the source

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.093 align:middle line:84%
of the Aztecs, the Mayans,
the Anasazi, the Hopi,

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.972 align:middle line:84%
were they related, were
there different streams,

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:28.685 align:middle line:84%
one of the interesting parts of
this was the mythology behind

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:33.023 align:middle line:84%
the Aztecs, that their origin
source was a place where there

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:37.527 align:middle line:84%
were four rivers
that intersected.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.572 align:middle line:84%
>> If there are several tribes
reported to be from this

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:44.034 align:middle line:84%
ancient area, does this also
mean they originated from

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.911 align:middle line:90%
the same knowledge?

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:47.579 align:middle line:84%
There was another
interesting clue

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.582 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Orozco
and his team found.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.584 align:middle line:84%
They suggested
that these symbols

00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:55.504 align:middle line:84%
represented the Venusian
cycle and are also

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:59.466 align:middle line:84%
connected to one of the
Aztec gods, Quetzalcoatl.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Quetzalcoatl was the
astrological equivalent

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.389 align:middle line:90%
of Venus.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.226 align:middle line:84%
And when you study
ancient cultures,

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:11.019 align:middle line:84%
the movements of
Venus are extremely

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:17.442 align:middle line:84%
important for not only
the planting of crops,

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:20.695 align:middle line:84%
but they could tell
the cycles of time

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.739 align:middle line:90%
from the movements of Venus.

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:24.366 align:middle line:84%
The movements of
Venus around our star

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.952 align:middle line:84%
is so precise that
you can literally

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:30.622 align:middle line:84%
time everything by them
in a society or a culture.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:35.252 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
ancient Egyptian culture

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:37.921 align:middle line:84%
and the Sumerian culture,
the movements of Venus

00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.841 align:middle line:84%
always take on an
extremely important role.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.052 align:middle line:84%
>> So, it's highly
probable that yes,

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:47.472 align:middle line:84%
there are certain symbols in
certain caves around Utah that

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:51.101 align:middle line:84%
do specifically tie-in with
a lot of the Mayan calendars,

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:53.353 align:middle line:84%
a lot of their images
of Quetzalcoatl,

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.355 align:middle line:84%
one of their
central god figures.

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.815 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, these symbols

00:05:56.815 --> 00:06:00.068 align:middle line:84%
are also shared by
other cultures as well.

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.195 align:middle line:84%
So, they're not just inherent
in the Aztec culture.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.447 align:middle line:84%
They're also shared by
the Anasazi and the Hopi,

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.325 align:middle line:84%
the Navajo, the
Apache, and so forth.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:12.163 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Quetzalcoatl the missing
link in the mystery of Aztlan?

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.749 align:middle line:84%
And could his
symbol be universal

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.544 align:middle line:84%
in the lineage of all the
different civilizations

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:21.381 align:middle line:84%
of ancient America and
possibly ancient Sumer?

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.467 align:middle line:84%
Author Anton Parks
believes Quetzalcoatl

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:29.014 align:middle line:84%
could have an ancient link
to the Sumerian god Enki.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:31.391 align:middle line:84%
Based on his research,
he discovered

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that Enki left Sumer
and resided in Egypt.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.107 align:middle line:84%
When he came to Egypt,
he became Osiris.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.568 align:middle line:84%
According to the Egyptian
Book of the Dead,

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:45.697 align:middle line:84%
Osiris was then killed by Set
and resurrected by his wife

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.366 align:middle line:90%
Isis as the son Horus.

00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:52.662 align:middle line:84%
Horus then revenges
his father's death.

>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.886 align:middle line:84%
>> In some Sumerian texts,
but also in Egyptian ones,

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:11.139 align:middle line:84%
Horus takes advantage of
the fact that Venus appears

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.016 align:middle line:90%
in the sky to start the fight.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:16.019 align:middle line:84%
That is interesting, because
the link between Horus and Venus

00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:17.646 align:middle line:90%
is quite clear.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:20.273 align:middle line:84%
Horus manages to defeat
Set in an epic battle.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:26.071 align:middle line:84%
When Horus finally
defeats Set, he completely

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:28.865 align:middle line:90%
disappears from Egyptian texts.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:32.911 align:middle line:84%
I think that I found his
trace in America near Mexico

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:34.371 align:middle line:90%
under the name Quetzalcoatl.

00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:40.377 align:middle line:84%
I think that he wanted to leave
the Sumerian and Egyptian gods'

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:43.338 align:middle line:84%
heavy atmosphere to
create his own community,

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:45.799 align:middle line:84%
where he will be
called Quetzalcoatl.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:49.219 align:middle line:84%
We also find traces of
him a little further down,

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:53.264 align:middle line:84%
such as in Peru, under
the name Viracocha.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:55.808 align:middle line:84%
I believe when he
flees to America,

00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:58.144 align:middle line:84%
he isolates himself,
he transforms

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:02.023 align:middle line:84%
into this wise character, has
a whole community around him,

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.734 align:middle line:84%
and he calls himself
Quetzalcoatl.

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:08.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Among the Aztecs, whose
beliefs are the best documented

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:12.075 align:middle line:84%
in many historical sources,
Quetzalcoatl was related

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:15.912 align:middle line:84%
to gods of the wind, of the
planet Venus, of the dawn,

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.373 align:middle line:90%

is the civilizer deity of
ancient Central America.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:30.552 align:middle line:84%
He's remembered most
for that, for bringing

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.804 align:middle line:84%
the gifts of civilization,
and for teaching

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:35.849 align:middle line:90%
a doctrine of peace and love.

becomes a father figure

00:08:38.934 --> 00:08:39.769 align:middle line:90%
to humanity.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:84%
He shows people how to
do things properly--

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.399 align:middle line:84%
how to build temples,
how to navigate,

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:47.444 align:middle line:84%
how to basically set
the motions in life that

00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:84%
create a fundamental basis
from which you can adapt a very

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.743 align:middle line:90%
civilized lifestyle.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:90%
kill fellow human beings.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.021 align:middle line:90%
That's a terrible crime.

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:25.356 align:middle line:84%
If you want to sacrifice,
sacrifice flowers,

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:26.941 align:middle line:90%
sacrifice fruits.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.944 align:middle line:84%
This is the peaceful
and beautiful teaching

00:09:29.944 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:90%
of Quetzalcoatl.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.658 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating that the
earliest image of Quetzalcoatl

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.786 align:middle line:84%
does come from the Olmec
site of La Venta, where

00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:40.872 align:middle line:84%
we see this figure that is
called "Man in Serpent,"

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:44.918 align:middle line:84%
where you see the coiled figure
of a serpent with the plume,

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:50.423 align:middle line:84%
with the feathered head,
and within it a man holding

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:53.343 align:middle line:84%
one of those man bags
that we find in Sumer

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:56.763 align:middle line:84%
and we find in Gobekli
Tepe and elsewhere.

00:09:56.763 --> 00:10:00.934 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of Quetzalcoatl
as a serpent being seems to be

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:04.729 align:middle line:84%
apparent in such groups as
the Incas and the Mayans.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:06.815 align:middle line:84%
Is this more proof
that they all were

00:10:06.815 --> 00:10:09.359 align:middle line:90%
influenced by the same god?

00:10:09.359 --> 00:10:13.571 align:middle line:84%
How then did the Aztecs twist
the teachings and the wisdom?

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:16.658 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock suggests
that according to the legend

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:18.785 align:middle line:84%
another prominent
god then steps in

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.204 align:middle line:84%
to drive out
Quetzalcoatl and assume

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.414 align:middle line:90%
leadership of the Aztecs.

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:26.751 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, Quetzalcoatl after
performing his civilizing

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:29.379 align:middle line:84%
mission in Central
America, the traditions,

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:33.049 align:middle line:84%
the myths tell us that he
was driven out of the region.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:36.928 align:middle line:84%
And as he leaves, he
promises that he will return,

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:40.098 align:middle line:84%
that he will return, and
that he will overthrow

00:10:40.098 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:90%
the cult of the war god.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Who was this usurper?

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:90%
The war god, Huitzilopochtli.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.276 align:middle line:84%
>> He's a very dark
god, to be honest.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And yet in contrast,
you have Quetzalcoatl.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.283 align:middle line:90%
Now, he's the feathered serpent.

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:90%
His colors are bright--

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.537 align:middle line:90%
blues and greens.

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.497 align:middle line:90%
And he was a vegetarian.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:90%
And he did all the good things.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.042 align:middle line:90%
He civilized the world.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:11.754 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like there's
some kind of dualism going on

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.214 align:middle line:90%
between these two gods.

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:17.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Quetzalcoatl's antagonist
is Huitzilopochtli.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:21.306 align:middle line:84%
You can translate his
name as hummingbird.

00:11:21.306 --> 00:11:24.684 align:middle line:84%
We think of hummingbirds as
very sweet little things.

00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.561 align:middle line:90%
But they are very determined.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:29.397 align:middle line:90%
And they're very fast.

00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:37.322 align:middle line:84%
And they are a perfect symbol
of the manifestation of will--

00:11:37.322 --> 00:11:40.658 align:middle line:84%
the ability of a hummingbird
to stay still in one

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.661 align:middle line:84%
place with its wings moving
at incredibly high speed.

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.581 align:middle line:84%
So, it's perhaps not surprising
that something apparently

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:48.499 align:middle line:84%
pretty, like the
hummingbird, is chosen

00:11:48.499 --> 00:11:50.627 align:middle line:90%
as the avatar of the god of war.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Where did this god come from?

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.051 align:middle line:84%
Could this be
another otherworldly

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.553 align:middle line:84%
being inserting itself
into the programming

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.556 align:middle line:90%
of the Aztec culture.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Originally, he was
of little importance

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.895 align:middle line:90%
before the migration to Mexico.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:12.065 align:middle line:84%
But after Quetzalcoatl's
departure,

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.192 align:middle line:84%
the Aztecs reformed
their religion

00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:16.694 align:middle line:84%
and put Huitzilopochtli
at the same level

00:12:16.694 --> 00:12:20.615 align:middle line:84%
as Quetzalcoatl,
making him a solar god.

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:23.826 align:middle line:84%
It is Huitzilopochtli that
directed the Aztecs to leave

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:26.537 align:middle line:90%
Aztlan and find a new home.

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Huitzilopochtli also left
specific instructions

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.962 align:middle line:84%
on how they would
find their new home.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:38.383 align:middle line:84%
>> When you listen to what
the Aztec elders say today,

00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:44.347 align:middle line:84%
was that the leader of the tribe
before they left Aztlan had

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:45.723 align:middle line:90%
a vision.

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:48.184 align:middle line:84%
In the vision, a
god appeared to him

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:51.437 align:middle line:84%
and told him that he had to
travel south with the tribe

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:55.233 align:middle line:84%
till they came across an
eagle sitting on a barb tree

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:56.859 align:middle line:90%
eating a snake.

00:12:56.859 --> 00:13:01.364 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they made
their way into Central America.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:06.202 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was an
eagle sitting on a cactus.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.162 align:middle line:84%
And it was literally
eating a snake.

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.872 align:middle line:84%
And they took that
as a sign of where

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.999 align:middle line:90%
they were going to settle.

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:15.003 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is, indeed,
apparently what I saw on this

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.004 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.171 align:middle line:90%
They saw this cactus.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.756 align:middle line:90%
They saw the bird.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:21.426 align:middle line:84%
And in its talents
was the snake.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:90%
And this is where I stopped.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.389 align:middle line:84%
And it was in a middle
of lake, an island

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.849 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of a lake.

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:31.227 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they built
this great city, which became

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:34.647 align:middle line:90%
the center of the Aztec empire.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:38.192 align:middle line:84%
>> Built on the fertile
island of Lago de Texcoco,

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:41.154 align:middle line:84%
the great city became
known as Tenochtitlan.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:45.241 align:middle line:84%
Today, this is the site of
the bustling metropolis Mexico

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.909 align:middle line:90%
City.

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.287 align:middle line:84%
If the imagery of an
eagle eating a serpent

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:53.875 align:middle line:84%
feels familiar, the symbol is
used today on Mexico's flag.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.878 align:middle line:84%
But could it have a much
more ancient meaning?

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Some scholars, like
Jack Cary, believe

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.966 align:middle line:84%
this symbol is rooted
in an ancient conflict

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.385 align:middle line:90%
between otherworldly forces.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:09.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps, it was a time when
the ancient serpent lineage

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:15.521 align:middle line:84%
became lesser than this new
royal bloodline that had

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.483 align:middle line:90%
emerged as the Aztec royalty.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.943 align:middle line:84%
>> They continued to
worship the god of war.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:22.862 align:middle line:84%
And over the next
few hundred years,

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.406 align:middle line:84%
their empire thrives,
despite an increase

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:29.869 align:middle line:84%
in bloodshed and the
use of human sacrifice.

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What's fascinating is that
eventually the Aztecs take

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.504 align:middle line:84%
on human sacrifice as a
way of appeasing this god.

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:43.633 align:middle line:84%
They tell us that they were
sacrificing humans in order

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:48.429 align:middle line:84%
to retard the movement of the
Sun into the next zodiac house.

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.516 align:middle line:84%
That is the processional
movement of our Sun.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.185 align:middle line:84%
Why they were trying to
retard the movement of the Sun

00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:58.481 align:middle line:84%
into the next zodiac house was
because it was this movement

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:01.526 align:middle line:84%
that they equated with being
the mechanism that caused

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:04.028 align:middle line:90%
global calamity on the Earth.

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:06.989 align:middle line:84%
They thought by appeasing
the Sun through human ritual

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:10.409 align:middle line:84%
sacrifice they could slow its
movement down in such a way

00:15:10.409 --> 00:15:13.871 align:middle line:84%
that they could avoid the
next global cataclysm.

00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:17.708 align:middle line:84%
>> They believed Huitzilopochtli
was in a constant struggle with

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.670 align:middle line:84%
the darkness and required
nourishment in the form

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.966 align:middle line:84%
of sacrifices to ensure the Sun
would survive the cycle of 52

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:29.178 align:middle line:84%
years, which was the basis
of many a Mesoamerican myths.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> They sort of somehow began to
misread the ancient teachings--

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.935 align:middle line:84%
what the ancient concept
of the gods were there for.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.103 align:middle line:90%
They were as metaphors.

00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:39.313 align:middle line:84%
They were there as
teaching aids to help

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:45.486 align:middle line:84%
the individual rise above his or
her own base living situation.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.947 align:middle line:84%
It was about raising
your level of awareness.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:51.367 align:middle line:84%
What the Aztecs began
to do, which is often

00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:52.994 align:middle line:84%
what happens with so
many old cultures,

00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:55.121 align:middle line:84%
they began to take
these things literally.

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:58.249 align:middle line:84%
So, when they start looking
at their war god and saying,

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:01.002 align:middle line:84%
I am your war god, in
order for the Aztec to go

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:04.213 align:middle line:84%
on being who they are and go
on surviving for thousands

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:07.508 align:middle line:84%
of years, if you appease
me by doing blood

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
sacrifices and ritual,
I will make sure

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.638 align:middle line:84%
that you're protected
from future darkness.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.724 align:middle line:84%
You will always be
protected from darkness.

00:16:14.724 --> 00:16:17.476 align:middle line:84%
The evil spirits will never
come and infiltrate your lives

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:18.269 align:middle line:90%
ever again.

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that the Aztec were
terrified that their gods had

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:90%
left them.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.776 align:middle line:84%
And so, this act
of violence, this

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:33.451 align:middle line:84%
killing people and sacrificing
people to appease the gods,

00:16:33.451 --> 00:16:37.246 align:middle line:84%
it's a practice that
we've seen in many places

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.247 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:42.668 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that they felt
abandoned by everyone.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.629 align:middle line:90%
They were angry about it.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:48.341 align:middle line:84%
And this was their way
of showing the world

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:52.094 align:middle line:84%
that they were powerful, even
though they were very fearful.

00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:55.139 align:middle line:84%
>> But could their fear of
darkness have finally caught up

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:90%
with them?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.267 align:middle line:84%
Not even their
precious god could

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:01.646 align:middle line:84%
have saved them from what
was about to happen next.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:05.191 align:middle line:84%
In 1519, a ship
arrives on their shores

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:09.487 align:middle line:84%
and a strange white bearded
man introduces himself.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:14.282 align:middle line:84%
>> And eventually, Cortes
comes to the Aztec people.

00:17:14.282 --> 00:17:17.328 align:middle line:84%
And the only other
time that they

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:21.999 align:middle line:84%
had seen a creature with a beard
was on their god Quetzalcoatl.

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:26.878 align:middle line:84%
And here's a Spaniard wearing a
long beard with amazing armor.

00:17:26.878 --> 00:17:30.091 align:middle line:84%
And they were riding these
incredible creatures,

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.593 align:middle line:84%
the horses that they
brought with them.

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:39.183 align:middle line:84%
>> When Cortes comes on those
beaches and has a beard and is

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:45.231 align:middle line:84%
white-skinned and hair, so
the people who have been

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:48.192 align:middle line:84%
worshipping and waiting
for Quetzalcoatl,

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:53.447 align:middle line:84%
they transfer their
energies to Cortes.

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:59.078 align:middle line:84%
And Cortes from
Europe is not a god.

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:03.124 align:middle line:84%
>> Led by his faith, the Aztec
emperor Moctezuma initially

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:07.837 align:middle line:84%
greets Cortes and his
conquistadors with open arms.

00:18:07.837 --> 00:18:12.967 align:middle line:84%
>> He's thrown into a state
of hysteria by the arrival

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:13.759 align:middle line:90%
of Cortes.

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:16.178 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating looking at
the documents from the period.

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:17.972 align:middle line:84%
Both the Aztecs and
the conquistadors

00:18:17.972 --> 00:18:20.558 align:middle line:90%
kept detailed records.

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:25.313 align:middle line:84%
To gather-- to get a sense of
the state of mind of Moctezuma,

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:26.522 align:middle line:90%
he was a bully.

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:30.109 align:middle line:84%
He was an aggressive,
domineering dictator.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:33.195 align:middle line:84%
But when he thought he was
facing a returning god,

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:34.697 align:middle line:90%
his knees turned to water.

00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:38.075 align:middle line:84%
He ceased to have any courage
or confidence whatsoever.

00:18:38.075 --> 00:18:40.953 align:middle line:84%
And Cortes very quickly
learned about this

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:43.664 align:middle line:84%
and took advantage of
it and played upon it

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:46.792 align:middle line:84%
and used it as part of
his psychological game

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:50.963 align:middle line:84%
to overthrow the Aztec
empire and take from them

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.631 align:middle line:90%
everything that they had.

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:56.385 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Cortes
was no god of peace.

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:59.513 align:middle line:90%
Cortes was no Quetzalcoatl.

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:02.141 align:middle line:84%
Cortes was only
there for one thing.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.393 align:middle line:84%
He was there to take
everything they had.

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:08.064 align:middle line:84%
He was there to destroy
utterly their culture.

00:19:08.064 --> 00:19:11.525 align:middle line:84%
But he took advantage of and
rode upon that myth on his way

00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:12.318 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.362 align:middle line:84%
And in the first
encounter-- direct encounter

00:19:14.362 --> 00:19:19.575 align:middle line:84%
between Moctezuma and Cortes,
this matter is raised directly.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:23.996 align:middle line:84%
And Moctezuma asks him,
are you truly Quetzalcoatl?

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.248 align:middle line:84%
And Cortes actually
says, no, I'm not.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:27.917 align:middle line:84%
But you see, he was
being clever there,

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:31.295 align:middle line:84%
because the deities of ancient
Mexico were tricksters.

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:32.755 align:middle line:84%
So, that's exactly
what Moctezuma

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.632 align:middle line:90%
would expect him to say.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.258 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you are Quetzalcoatl.

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:39.261 align:middle line:84%
Moctezuma did the work
in his own imagination.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:42.056 align:middle line:84%
It's a very curious and
extraordinary moment

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:45.351 align:middle line:84%
in human history, seen at
the time as the fulfillment

00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:46.811 align:middle line:90%
of a prophecy.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.646 align:middle line:90%
But what was it really?

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:90%
It was the doom--

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:56.487 align:middle line:84%
it was the doom of the ancient
cultures of Central America.

00:19:56.487 --> 00:19:59.532 align:middle line:90%
>> What was really at play here?

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.367 align:middle line:84%
Was it the belief
in certain gods

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:04.245 align:middle line:84%
as more powerful
than themselves?

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:08.541 align:middle line:84%
Or could the demise of the
Aztec people by Cortes in 1519

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.793 align:middle line:84%
have been a battle
for humanity based

00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
on warring
extraterrestrial forces

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:17.091 align:middle line:84%
still at play in our world
thousands of years later?

00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:19.468 align:middle line:84%
Could the killing off
of a great civilization

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:22.221 align:middle line:84%
be the last remnants of
ancient knowledge practiced

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.848 align:middle line:90%
on the planet?

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:26.559 align:middle line:84%
The evidence of ancient
powers still at work

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.769 align:middle line:84%
can be reflected by
an internal search

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that the Spanish
priesthood performed.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
They were very
concerned with how

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.318 align:middle line:84%
this civilization fit into
their understanding of God

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:38.446 align:middle line:90%
and creation.

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:42.366 align:middle line:84%
And they sent missionaries
to Mexico to dissect it.

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:45.202 align:middle line:84%
Could their creation
stories be linked?

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
These concerns may have
arisen from research documents

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.040 align:middle line:84%
like the "Aubin
Codex," which was

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.251 align:middle line:84%
compiled by a
Dominican friar named

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.546 align:middle line:90%
Diego Doran in the late 1500s.

00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:58.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the discovery
of the "Aubin Codex"

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:07.183 align:middle line:84%
and its resulting translation
showed an extremely close

00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:10.394 align:middle line:84%
similarity between the
Sumerian creation stories

00:21:10.394 --> 00:21:14.315 align:middle line:84%
and the creation stories
of the Mesoamerica people.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.984 align:middle line:84%
And those creation stories
speak of a pantheon

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:21.572 align:middle line:84%
of gods who ended up creating
man, not a single god,

00:21:21.572 --> 00:21:24.992 align:middle line:84%
as was being professed by
the church at that time.

00:21:24.992 --> 00:21:29.663 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, a lot of
the information was suppressed.

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:33.792 align:middle line:84%
They saw such close
similarities between the two,

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:37.338 align:middle line:84%
that to a lot of them, it
sort of scared them and said,

00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.882 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, when people
see the similarities,

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:42.801 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
think, well, mankind

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:46.347 align:middle line:84%
was created by these
creature, by the Anunnaki,

00:21:46.347 --> 00:21:49.934 align:middle line:84%
by the serpent gods, and
not by the one true God

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.520 align:middle line:90%
in Christianity.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.523 align:middle line:84%
>> What would happen to the
belief systems of the world

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
if we realized we came
from the same creation?

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.988 align:middle line:84%
And even more disturbing,
what if these belief systems

00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:06.617 align:middle line:84%
were being used by warring
races for their own agenda.

00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:10.538 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most shocking
discussions I ever had

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:15.543 align:middle line:84%
in my professional career
was in New York City in 1984.

00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:18.212 align:middle line:84%
And I got a phone call at my
office one day from a man.

00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:25.052 align:middle line:84%
And we had a discussion about
the ancient civilizations

00:22:25.052 --> 00:22:28.681 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, including
the Garden of Eden,

00:22:28.681 --> 00:22:32.977 align:middle line:84%
that had nothing to do
with Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:36.605 align:middle line:84%
It all had to do with
extraterrestrials

00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:39.358 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrials
that were in war.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.695 align:middle line:84%
And I was shocked at
the level and depth

00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:46.907 align:middle line:84%
at which this man
told me details, tying

00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:49.493 align:middle line:84%
our ancient civilization
to extraterrestrials

00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:53.747 align:middle line:84%
who warred with each other
and that we ourselves

00:22:53.747 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:84%
may be concerned about
the return of any of them.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.965 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, is there
more evidence of a secret

00:23:02.965 --> 00:23:06.135 align:middle line:84%
agenda in the research
these priests did?

00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:09.638 align:middle line:84%
More intriguing parallels can
be found in a Spanish research

00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.849 align:middle line:84%
document written
by Friar Bernardino

00:23:11.849 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:90%
Sahagun during the 1500s.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.313 align:middle line:84%
Known as the
"Florentine Codex," it

00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:84%
also details the history
and culture of the Aztecs

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
based on decades of research
compiled by Sahagun.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
The document reached some
startling conclusions,

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.659 align:middle line:84%
so startling, in fact,
that the "Florentine Codex"

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:90%
was never published.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's put this into context.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.291 align:middle line:84%
We're in the middle of the
Medieval era in Europe.

00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:41.211 align:middle line:84%
So, we have a culture that's
based on plunder, destruction,

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:45.299 align:middle line:84%
and the complete subjugation by
a particular religious order.

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:48.469 align:middle line:84%
From this culture emerges
a group of Spanish people

00:23:48.469 --> 00:23:50.721 align:middle line:84%
who ride all the way
across the Atlantic,

00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.765 align:middle line:90%
they land in Central America.

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:58.354 align:middle line:84%
And they are totally amazed
to find that these supposed

00:23:58.354 --> 00:24:01.607 align:middle line:84%
morons and barbarians-- and they
were barbarians, by the way.

00:24:01.607 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, human sacrifice is
not an enlightening thing.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.737 align:middle line:84%
But they found, quite
to their amazement,

00:24:06.737 --> 00:24:08.238 align:middle line:84%
that their stories
and their myths

00:24:08.238 --> 00:24:10.658 align:middle line:84%
actually sounded very much
like the stuff that was already

00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:12.701 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, which,
back in Europe

00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.829 align:middle line:84%
was the high point
of civilization.

00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:17.998 align:middle line:84%
So, they began to write
these things down.

00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:19.708 align:middle line:84%
And the more they
wrote and the more they

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.251 align:middle line:84%
listened to the
Aztecs, the more they

00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:25.422 align:middle line:84%
realized that their myth
really preceded Christianity.

00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:26.382 align:middle line:90%
Now we have a problem.

00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start
describing the god

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:33.472 align:middle line:84%
Quetzalcoatl, who basically
was born of a virgin in a cave,

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.974 align:middle line:84%
he goes AWOL for 40 days
into the wilderness,

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:38.769 align:middle line:84%
goes on top of a sacred
hill, preaches religion

00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:42.398 align:middle line:84%
to the masses, then is mailed
figuratively to a cross,

00:24:42.398 --> 00:24:45.818 align:middle line:84%
not literally, gets
out three days later

00:24:45.818 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:84%
after he crosses into the
other world around the 21st

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.323 align:middle line:84%
of December and is
resurrected as a god-man,

00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:54.243 align:middle line:84%
after which is
deified as a hero,

00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:57.413 align:middle line:90%
that story was already around.

00:24:57.413 --> 00:25:00.666 align:middle line:84%
So, being a priest in
the middle of all this,

00:25:00.666 --> 00:25:03.794 align:middle line:84%
I would've gone, oh,
dear, oh, Susanna, we

00:25:03.794 --> 00:25:05.337 align:middle line:84%
have a bit of a
problem, Houston.

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.715 align:middle line:84%
Because now it means that
everything that's in the Bible,

00:25:07.715 --> 00:25:09.717 align:middle line:84%
everything that we've
been worshipping in Europe

00:25:09.717 --> 00:25:12.052 align:middle line:90%
is actually much, much older.

00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:14.763 align:middle line:84%
So, they put one and one
together, and they realized,

00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:17.099 align:middle line:84%
my god, this stuff is almost
like what the Sumerians was

00:25:17.099 --> 00:25:19.643 align:middle line:90%
saying in 3,000 BCE.

00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:22.354 align:middle line:84%
>> The Codex is
presented to the church.

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:26.024 align:middle line:84%
But predictably, they wanted
nothing to do with it.

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:28.402 align:middle line:84%
>> It's only today, we're
beginning to realize that

00:25:28.402 --> 00:25:31.947 align:middle line:84%
the Old World, as we called it,
was actually much more ahead

00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:34.783 align:middle line:84%
than what Europe was
professing at the time.

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:37.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the ancient knowledge
from Quetzalcoatl have been

00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:39.580 align:middle line:90%
given to the Aztecs?

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.875 align:middle line:84%
If so, did the Aztecs
pervert this knowledge?

00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:44.752 align:middle line:84%
And could another
influence have stepped

00:25:44.752 --> 00:25:48.505 align:middle line:84%
in, disguised as the
war god Huitzilopochtli?

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:50.924 align:middle line:84%
If this is true,
is this more proof

00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.427 align:middle line:84%
that the demise of the Aztecs
might have been played out

00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:57.055 align:middle line:84%
by a supernatural and
otherworldly force left behind

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:58.432 align:middle line:90%
by these gods?

00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:02.603 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to ask ourself, is it
possible that these two beings

00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:06.774 align:middle line:84%
who allegedly came from
the stars are actually two

00:26:06.774 --> 00:26:08.317 align:middle line:90%
otherworldly beings in conflict?

00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:10.068 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
that we're looking

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:15.532 align:middle line:84%
at two creatures who were not
friendly towards each other?

00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
that we're actually

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:21.246 align:middle line:84%
looking at two different deities
or two different otherworldly

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:22.039 align:middle line:90%
beings?

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:24.541 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, and
if we take a look

00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:27.169 align:middle line:84%
at ancient texts and
mythology and everything

00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:30.756 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Aztecs and Mayans
left behind, the answer is yes.

00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:33.759 align:middle line:84%
>> A possible takeaway from
the destruction of these people

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:36.887 align:middle line:84%
and their culture could be
that there are greater forces

00:26:36.887 --> 00:26:39.473 align:middle line:84%
on Earth battling
behind the scenes,

00:26:39.473 --> 00:26:42.643 align:middle line:84%
manipulating our societies
and turning them against each

00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:43.977 align:middle line:90%
other.

00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:47.272 align:middle line:84%
Could the need for Quetzalcoatl
and his ancient lineage

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:49.733 align:middle line:84%
have become extinct
at some point?

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:51.193 align:middle line:84%
And could the fear
of the unknown

00:26:51.193 --> 00:26:53.987 align:middle line:84%
have invited another type
of otherworldly force

00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:55.989 align:middle line:90%
on this planet?

00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:59.034 align:middle line:84%
If we are always waiting
for a new force to guide us,

00:26:59.034 --> 00:27:02.204 align:middle line:84%
like the arrival of
Cortes seen as a god,

00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:04.289 align:middle line:84%
are we missing the
human potential

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:07.376 align:middle line:84%
to create a new world
by the understanding

00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:11.046 align:middle line:84%
that we are all connected
to the same creation?

00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:13.131 align:middle line:84%
If we return to
ancient lineages,

00:27:13.131 --> 00:27:17.553 align:middle line:84%
like the legend of Aztlan,
do we find more answers?

00:27:17.553 --> 00:27:20.264 align:middle line:84%
Experts like Freddy Silva
point to a connection

00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:23.392 align:middle line:84%
to a star system that
has infiltrated almost

00:27:23.392 --> 00:27:26.228 align:middle line:90%
all ancient civilizations.

00:27:26.228 --> 00:27:29.314 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the connection to
Sirius is the fact that Sirius

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:32.401 align:middle line:84%
was always regarded as a source
of wisdom, of high wisdom.

00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:34.486 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was brought
here through shamanic means

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.823 align:middle line:84%
or by actual physical beings
that came here from Sirius,

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:39.074 align:middle line:90%
that's another matter.

00:27:39.074 --> 00:27:41.994 align:middle line:84%
I think both lines of
inquiry are actually true.

00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:44.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Could there be an even
more ancient lineage trying

00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:47.165 align:middle line:90%
to change the human code?

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:51.628 align:middle line:84%
Up next, we trace the Sirius
connection from a tribe in Mali

00:27:51.628 --> 00:27:54.548 align:middle line:90%
to the mystery schools of Egypt.
