00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:10%
>> In the late summer of
1988, Collinsville, Illinois,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:10%
near the Cahokia Mounds,
construction workers

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:10%
accidentally unearthed a stone
tomb that contained several

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:10%
giant bodies, each
measuring over 7 feet tall.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Following this
discovery, the bodies

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
quickly disappeared only to
add more mystery to the idea

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that a large species of humans
once inhabited the Americas.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
What is left of this
mysterious mound complex

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:84%
still baffles
archaeologists today.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Cahokia was considered the
largest city North of Mexico

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
with a population between
25,000 and 50,000 in 1000 AD.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.180 align:middle line:84%
This Native American
civilization

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
had an advanced system of
waterways, agriculture,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and textiles, and
also many legends

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.580 align:middle line:84%
of what they referred to
as the mound builders.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Who were these mound builders?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Could they be linked to the
large bodies accidentally found

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient tomb?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that what
they had stumbled upon

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:84%
was the remains
of a great culture

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:84%
that not only roamed the
Americas, but also the world?

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Researcher, Brad Olson, suggests
that these mounds themselves

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
hold the key to these
forgotten ancient beings.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:10%
>> It is true that giants
have been found in the mounds

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:10%
in the Midwest.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:10%
There are several different
cultures in the Midwest.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
It started basically
in the state of Ohio.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It started with the
Adena culture, which

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
then became the
Hopewell, and then it

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:84%
became the larger Mississippian
culture that encompasses

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.820 align:middle line:90%
the entire Mississippi Valley.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
There are over 2,000 pyramidal
mounds in North America,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.002 align:middle line:90%
including Mexico.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:10%
>> When you're looking
at North Americas,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:10%
you discover these
mounds that the Indians,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:10%
or the Native Americans, built
to honor the dead giants that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.192 align:middle line:10%
probably ruled over
them in some way.

00:02:57.192 --> 00:02:58.650 align:middle line:84%
In the North
Americas, these mounds

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.690 align:middle line:84%
are built up from
the Earth itself

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
in the shape of snakes and
other various creatures

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:90%
and some are just mounds.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that's
really interesting

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
is when you look
around the world,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:84%
you also find they have
something called dolmens.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Dolmens are just
these massive stones

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.307 align:middle line:84%
put together to let as
a marker that there's

00:03:15.307 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:90%
a giant buried here.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.277 align:middle line:84%
There's somebody of
Royalty buried here.

00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, we've done
the same thing here

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.890 align:middle line:84%
in North Americas where they
build this huge mound, which

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.090 align:middle line:90%
is very hard to do.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:84%
So the thing that really
binds them together

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that they're
both these massive monuments

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:84%
to people that may have been
very, very spiritual to them

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient past.

1,500 newspaper articles that

all span from the early
1900s, late 1800s of nonstop

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:84%
discoveries of giant
bones and mounds.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Some of them not in mounds.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are
giant bones that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:10%
have Native American
lineage, which is interesting

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:10%
because when you look at some
of the writings of the earliest

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:10%
explorers in North America,
in most of their journals,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.760 align:middle line:10%
they described the Chiefs of
each tribe as being a giant.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Some of them 12 to 15 feet tall.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, here, yet again,
you're seeing this upper status

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
being given to the people that
have that genetic lineage.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at that
happening in North America,

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you look at the logs
of the very first ship that

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
landed on Easter
Island, and what

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:90%
was the first thing they said?

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a race
of giants there.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And the race of giants were the
priestly class of the Rapa Nui

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.410 align:middle line:84%
people, and that they were
overseeing the construction

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.090 align:middle line:90%
of those stone huts.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
That story right there,
you can take that and place

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:84%
it a hundred different
areas all around the world

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:90%

>> Another strange piece
of evidence that might add

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
credence to this mythology is
that there are over 100 large

were living on Earth.

many hundreds of oversized

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:10%

Native American cemeteries.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Many of the skeletons were
around 7 to 7 and 1/2 feet

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:84%
tall, and they were discovered
by archaeologists associated

with the Smithsonian
Institution,

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:90%
and they were fully recoded.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:90%
They were taken away.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
publications that exist today

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that you can read all
about these discoveries.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So what are these giants
and what happened to them?

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, firstly, we can say
that all of these bones

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.870 align:middle line:90%
have now gone.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.290 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, even
though many of them

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:10%
were in the Smithsonian,
they were repatriated,

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:10%
the beginning of the 1990s
as part of the NAGPRA

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:10%
law, the repatriation of Native
American indigenous peoples

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:10%
remains.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:10%
So unfortunately, they've
all gone from the museums

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:10%
and institutions so
we can't look at them

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:10%
and study them today.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But what we can do is
look at these reports

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and glean information
about what was going on.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that traces
of their lineage can still be

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
found today, but hidden within
the very fabric of humanity?

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:53.960 align:middle line:84%
On February 22, 1918, only
25 miles from Collinsville,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:84%
average Illinoian couple,
Harold and Addie Wadlow,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
gave birth to a child
who grew to become

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:90%
the tallest man in the world.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Standing at 8 feet
and 11 inches,

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Robert Wadlow was
a human anomaly

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
until his death at
the young age of 22.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:10%
Wadlow's immense height
and his continued growth

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.020 align:middle line:10%
until the day he died were
due to what doctors say

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:10%
is hyperplasia of the
pituitary gland, which

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:10%
resulted in abnormally high
levels of human growth hormone

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:10%
in his body.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
But could this growth hormone be
a hidden gene in all human DNA?

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:10%
>> It was determined that he
suffered from what's called

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:10%
hyperplasia or
pituitary gigantism.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:84%
A gigantism is something
that occurs in most species,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's on a
very, very minute--

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:52.990 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about like
0.0007% of each population

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
ends up having a
case of gigantism.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Wadlow
could represent for us

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:84%
a very real example of the
survival of the very genes that

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
were causing the
gigantism described by all

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.440 align:middle line:90%
of these different cultures.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.170 align:middle line:10%
You have somebody
who is exhibiting

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.820 align:middle line:10%
what looks like the same gene
that some of these giants

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:10%
probably had in
the same area where

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:10%
these mounds were constructed.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Most of the doctors that saw him
said that this could very well

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:31.500 align:middle line:90%
have just been a genetic trait.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Can Robert Wadlow's giant
stature simply be attributed

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:84%
to his overactive
pituitary gland,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or might there be a
genetic connection?

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Geneticist, William Brown,
suggests that this isn't just

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:90%
a wild connection.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.390 align:middle line:90%
This could be humanly possible.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Within the human genome,
there's tucked away a vast

00:09:52.260 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:10%
reservoir of variations and gene
codes that will result in very

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.750 align:middle line:10%
unique phenotypes.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:10%
We have examples of that
with dwarfism, gigantism.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So we can see certain
instances where

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
gene segments and the
DNA that are normally

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
silenced or dormant are
expressed in a different way,

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and you get changes in
the size of the human.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:10%
So it is very possible that
within that large region

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:10%
of the DNA that has
dormant segments that there

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:10%
are genes that are
related to producing

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:10%
very large sized humans.

question about direct genetic

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:10%
evidence linking us to giants,
the giants of the past,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.320 align:middle line:10%
to the best of my knowledge,
that DNA evidence does not

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.060 align:middle line:10%
exist physically at this time.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:10%
However, when we begin looking
at the story of humankind,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:10%
what we see is the stories
of giants are pervasive.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
That they have been spoken about
in ancient history and that

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
we have found evidence
of them in modern times.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So the question
is, are we related

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:90%
to these giants in some way?

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.790 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the narrative of
our most ancient and cherished

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.162 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions,
there's a common theme

00:11:57.162 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that runs through all of them,
and it's a fascinating theme

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
for me because it
says that humankind

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:84%
went through multiple iterations
of an intentional process

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
to lead us to the point
where we are today.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
were multiple attempts

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:84%
to find just the right genetic
formula for the human body

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:90%
that we see today.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, when we look at
the Judeo-Christian traditions,

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
what they are telling
us is that there

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:84%
was a search for the
right genetic formula

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to hold the power of the
human spirit in physical form

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And as we went through the
multiple iterations of trial

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and error, there
were forms of life

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:84%
that were created
that simply were not

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
sustainable throughout
the eons of history.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And among those forms
of life, we certainly

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:90%
see reference to giants.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
he boasts pictures of
very large human bones

University of Padova in Italy.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.350 align:middle line:84%
The remains tested showed an
O blood type, Rh negative.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:10%
This is interesting
because Sardinia

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:10%
is one of the few places in
the world with the highest

was the result of their

If this is true.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:10%
in cold regions.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember
that most of the time

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:84%
that Nemnir were
spread in the world,

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:84%
it was during the glaciation,
the last glaciation that

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:84%
happened along 200,000
years approximately,

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and ended around 10,000 BC.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:10%
And during all that
time, the Nemnir

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:10%
where the rulers
of the regions like

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:10%
Europe, Siberia, part of the
Middle East, and North America.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Nemnir
were very big.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.540 align:middle line:90%
And most of them were redheads.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.390 align:middle line:10%
These beings were
the ones in control,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:12.340 align:middle line:10%
but they were not like
warriors as I can say.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:17.800 align:middle line:10%
The stories didn't say that they
were fighting against humans,

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.080 align:middle line:10%
but they were not friendly.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:84%
They came here to record
the information in the ice,

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and they were living
like ancient humans,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.950 align:middle line:90%
like surviving in caves.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:90%
They had not this civilization.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:90%
They had not cities.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And they lived in
small families,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:84%
some of them just alone
or only three of them.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:90%
They were not much population.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And they were living
in the northern parts.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And most of the humans
were so afraid of them

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and would never go to
the northern parts.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And they settled this idea of
don't come to these regions

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:90%
to create boundaries.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:84%
At the time when we
have no limits on Earth,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:84%
like no countries, no
borders, no passports,

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the only way you could say you
should not go beyond this point

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.040 align:middle line:90%
is by fear.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is why
some of the stories

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
were used to create
limits in the regions.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
For the stories I know, it's
not that they hate humans,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
it's not that they
killed people,

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:35.170 align:middle line:84%
but they created the idea of
that so we wouldn't go to them.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to have connections

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
with humanity because they came
here to do their own stuff.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:84%
In the other hand, the Aessir,
the Anunnaki were big for us.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.850 align:middle line:90%
We could call them giants.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
But they did have a lot
of connection with us.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:84%
They even had relationships,
and sex, and lived with us.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of them loved us and
they had sons and kids,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other
ones were trying

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:90%
to control us like slaves.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So there were a few
of them, not many.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Also, not many
population because they

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.910 align:middle line:84%
came to this world surviving
because their own world

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:90%
was dying.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.910 align:middle line:84%
So they lived in some
mountains in the Middle East,

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
in the Mediterranean
Sea, but they were not

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:90%
much spread around the world.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And practically, they
taught us everything

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.610 align:middle line:90%
that we know as humans.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
that gave us the fire.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones that
taught us about agriculture,

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:90%
about society, about religion.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%

were bad for humans,

came from the stars

and taught us about
stuff, but no one

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.790 align:middle line:84%
taught us more about
ourselves like them

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.340 align:middle line:90%
They celebrated.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:90%

And for our unconscious,
the presence of the giants

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
was like saying to us that gods
and goddesses were like us.

that we didn't have, like
the power of control of fire,

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:84%
the power of control the
air, and the lightning,

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
that they could

do with their own process, where
the evolution took them to be.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.700 align:middle line:84%
But when we saw that they
had the same feelings,

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:84%
the same problems like us, made
us believe that we could also

have the same power.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
That we could also become
that, and this is why

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:90%
we won the war against them.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:57.870 align:middle line:84%
This is why the humans saw
that we could be greater.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And the image that we had
from them was like the image

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
that we wanted to become.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to be like Poseidon.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.710 align:middle line:90%
We wanted to be Zeus.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.190 align:middle line:84%

stars of our period.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%

could be like them.
