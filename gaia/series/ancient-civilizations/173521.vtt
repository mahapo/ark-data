[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:40.582 align:center line:0 position:50% size:46%
&gt;&gt; In 2013, Russian photographer
Georgy Sidorov discovered

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:46.630 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
a colossal megalith in a remote
wilderness area in Siberia.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.174 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
During an expedition
in the foothills of Mt.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:53.553 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
Shoriya near Altai, Sidorov
came upon a great wall

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.889 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
of granite blocks.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.600 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
What made his
discovery unusual was

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.147 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
that these gargantuan stones
had flat surfaces, right angles,

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:10.529 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
and sharp corners, reminiscent
of cyclopean masonry.

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:13.323 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; The thing is that nature
does not happen to see straight

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:14.574 align:center line:0 position:50% size:10%
angles.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.369 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
All blocks are built
like a brick wall.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.290 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
All of them have straight
angles, like a castle.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.874 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
There are thousands
of clues that

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:28.380 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
say this formation is built
by a form of intelligence.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.051 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
&gt;&gt; The beauty and precision
of this 130-foot structure has

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:37.097 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
left archaeologists with
no explanation for how such

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:41.184 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
an arrangement could
have formed naturally.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:44.354 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
Geologists have estimated that
the largest blocks of granite

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:45.147 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:8%
at Mt.

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:50.068 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
Shoriya weigh 3,000
to 4,000 tons.

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:53.530 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
Before this, the Pregnant
Woman stone of Baalbek,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.076 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
weighing 1,500 tons, was
the largest single stone

00:01:58.076 --> 00:01:59.578 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
used in an ancient site.

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:04.583 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
&gt;&gt; You have these
beautiful polygonal walls,

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.626 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
and they have perfect straight
lines with perfect right

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:07.419 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:10%
angles.

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.172 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
You have these massive
blocks of granite

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.008 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
that look like someone's
taking a big diamond drill

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:14.551 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
and sawed them right
down the middle.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.720 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
On granite, that takes effort.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.638 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
The Russian scientists
that went there,

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:20.849 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
they discovered some things
which cannot be explained

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.978 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
by nature, which are these
beautiful round almost pot

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:27.773 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
surfaces where they've taken
a drill and they've formed

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:29.566 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
a perfect depression.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.818 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
And they also have
these perfect tunnels,

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:35.614 align:center line:0 position:50% size:45%
and these doorways that seem to
be very deliberately put there.

00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:37.532 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
So maybe what
we're doing here is

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.826 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
taking an entire mountain
that's been completely shaped

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.579 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
by human hands.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.040 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
&gt;&gt; The megalithic structure
discovered in the Altai

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.461 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
Mountains near the Denisovan
Cave hearkens, really,

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:53.215 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
to structures like
Baalbek in Lebanon,

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:57.969 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
these cyclopean megalithic
structures that are hundreds

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.514 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
of tons in weight--

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:04.726 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
stones so large that even our
best equipment today could not

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:07.646 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
possibly even come
close to lifting them,

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:10.982 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
and that they were
using a type of science

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.734 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
and mathematical
understanding that

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.404 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
just wasn't available to
our ancient ancestors.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.451 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
&gt;&gt; If Georgy Sidorov's
discovery is real,

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.247 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
could it be evidence that
remote Siberia was once home

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.833 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
to an advanced civilization?

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.627 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
Near this discovery of
the megalithic wall,

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:35.173 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:45%
scientists believe they have
found bones from a new species.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.050 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
Could these places be linked?

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.346 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
In 2008, archaeologists
made world headlines

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.557 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
when they unearthed
a paleolithic finger

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.476 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
bone from a juvenile
female estimated

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:50.147 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
to be 41,000 years old.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:52.691 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
Further DNA analysis
indicated the finger

00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:57.821 align:center line:0 position:50% size:46%
was from a previously unknown
and extinct homonym subspecies.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.073 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
These previously
unknown ancestors

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.286 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
were christened with
the name Denisovan.

00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:08.957 align:center line:0 position:50% size:44%
&gt;&gt; The Denisovans are probably
the most exciting discovery

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:13.295 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
in the origins of
humanity for decades--

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:16.631 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
I mean, arguably even
in the last 100 years--

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:21.052 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
because we're talking
about a previously unknown

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:24.347 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
human population
who are different

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.183 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
than the Neanderthals,
that are different

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:29.352 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
to anatomical modern humans.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.063 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
The Denisovans
occupied large areas

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:36.860 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
of Central, Southern, and
Eastern Asia for anything

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.613 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
up to 200,000 years.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:42.491 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
They've told us,
for instance, that

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:48.705 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
many modern-day human
populations in the eastern part

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:52.459 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
of the Eurasian continent
have the DNA which

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:57.297 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
has been inherited from the
Denisovans in a similar manner

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:01.510 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
to how the people of the
Western Eurasian continent

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.889 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
have DNA within them
of the Neanderthals.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.809 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
They were of extreme
size, not just broad

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.854 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
but of extreme
height, perhaps even

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.190 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
as much as seven feet tall.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.780 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
But the DNA from these fossil
remains have told us so much.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.074 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
&gt;&gt; It has archaeologists
coming up in rashes,

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:27.786 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
because suddenly we have
here another human species

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:29.955 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
that's completely forgotten.

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.707 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
&gt;&gt; But who was this
forgotten species,

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.877 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
and how could their destiny on
the planet be linked with ours?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:46.096 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
&gt;&gt; Firstly, we know that a
further tooth that was found

00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.683 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
in the Denisova cave, but they
did really know too much about

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:54.437 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
it has now been confirmed to
be that of a Denisovan woman.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:58.316 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
It's about 125,000 years old.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.860 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
And this confirms
that the Denisovans

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.572 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
were in this area for
a much longer period

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:05.615 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
than had initially
been suggested.

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:07.951 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
And that's many,
many generations.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.912 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
That means that they were
an incredibly developed

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.330 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:15%
population.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.626 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; You go back before 200,000
years and in many areas at that

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:21.131 align:center line:0 position:50% size:44%
time, our species was coexisting
with other human species who

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:24.384 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
were human enough for us
to interbreed with them--

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:28.054 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
for example the
Neanderthals, for example

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.724 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
the recently
discovered Denisovans.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.935 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
Both of these human species
who are not anatomically

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:38.481 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
modern humans have left traces
in our anatomically modern

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.942 align:center line:0 position:50% size:18%
human DNA.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:44.321 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
We have to ask, if we're
talking of records going back

00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.865 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
hundreds of thousands
of years, is it possible

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:51.119 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
that these other
human species reached

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.997 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
a high level of development
during their tenure of life

00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:54.789 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:14%
on Earth?

00:06:54.789 --> 00:07:01.046 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
Is it possible that they
were advanced in some way?

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:04.924 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
&gt;&gt; Artifacts found in recent
archaeological digs at the cave

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:08.261 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
suggest that the Denisovans
were not only large,

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.388 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
but highly intelligent.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:13.224 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
Some scientists, like
Jack Cary, believe

00:07:13.224 --> 00:07:18.063 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
they had the ability to create
sophisticated technology.

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:21.816 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; The Denisovans had to be
much more advanced than what

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.944 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
they're being credited with.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.740 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
I say that because of the
discovery of a piece of jewelry

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.744 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
that they found in the
original Denisovan cave that

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.913 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
dated 40,000 years ago.

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:37.499 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
It was made of a
green polished rock,

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:41.044 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
and anthropologists believe
that this jewelry was only

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:42.962 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
worn on very special occasions.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.674 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
That indicates a culture.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.509 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:20%
It indicates art.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.012 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
It indicates a higher
understanding of reality.

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:54.933 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
These aren't people that
were simply clubbing animals

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.185 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
to death and using their furs.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:00.480 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
These were people that were
literally constructing jewelry.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.733 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
That's something a
lot of anthropologists

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:07.862 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
are uneasy with, because it
shows a depth of understanding

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:12.492 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
and beauty in their culture that
really shouldn't have existed

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:16.246 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
with such ancient hominids.

00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.164 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
&gt;&gt; The archeologists
kept digging a bit more,

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.332 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
as they tend to do.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.709 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
And they found
that when they got

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.921 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
to a layer that's about 380,000
years, they found tools there.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.006 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
They found a needle.

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.551 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
They found certain artifacts
looked like bracelets

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:30.969 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
and other ornaments,
and they also

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:35.306 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
found the ring which has been
beautifully shaped out of rock.

00:08:35.306 --> 00:08:38.601 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
It has been obviously
machined and polished.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.020 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Beautiful bone needles have
been found in the Denisovan

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.941 align:center line:0 position:50% size:35%
Cave, suggesting that the
Denisovans wore tailored

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.985 align:center line:0 position:50% size:12%
clothing.

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:50.405 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
Horse DNA has also been
found inside the cave

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:56.327 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
itself, suggesting that the
Denisovans not only hunted

00:08:56.327 --> 00:08:59.038 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
horses, but probably
domesticated them

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.583 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
and might even
have ridden horses.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:05.003 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
And this is probably tens
of thousands of years

00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:06.713 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
before it was even
thought possible

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:09.174 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
that you could ride
horses, something that

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:13.261 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
was considered conventionally
to only have occurred

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.388 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
in Bronze Age times.

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:19.350 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
And yet, here we have people
40,000, 50,000 years ago

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.979 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
who were riding horses,
domesticating them, catching

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:25.106 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:8%
them.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.692 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
&gt;&gt; If this scientific
data is true,

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:31.029 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
then how could these ancient
ancestors shed new light

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.697 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
on our evolution?

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.741 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
Perhaps it's possible
that they not only

00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:36.951 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
date back hundreds
of thousands of years

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:40.330 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
earlier than we had thought,
but to another world

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.292 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
entirely, a world where a
certain species survived

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:47.462 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
among these evolved creatures.

00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:50.965 align:center line:0 position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; When you're reading in
a book and you see H-O-M-O

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.801 align:center line:0 position:50% size:21%
S-A-P-I-E-N-S--

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:57.514 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
that's Homo sapien-- it's
my understanding Homo sapien

00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:02.310 align:center line:0 position:50% size:40%
is the word for the large
group of standing-up primates

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.856 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
that have started an
evolutionary trail from Lucy

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.901 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
in Africa about two
million years ago.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:13.613 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
But within Homo sapien,
there are a whole bunch

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:19.953 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
of models that have included
neanderthalensis, and now

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:24.415 align:center line:0 position:50% size:49%
Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.377 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; Andrew Collins has been
monitoring the movement of this

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:32.423 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
ancient giant human species
and has a different theory.

00:10:32.423 --> 00:10:37.053 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
&gt;&gt; We can say almost certainly
that because our ancestors

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:44.602 align:center line:0 position:50% size:45%
interbred with them, there were
hybrids of Denisovans and Homo

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:49.440 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
sapiens that continued
their traditions for tens

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.028 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
of thousands of years, evolving
these ideas and then spreading

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:57.866 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
them into other parts of the
Eurasian continent and also

00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:59.576 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
into the Americas.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:03.037 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; If you go further south
to the area around Sumeria,

00:11:03.037 --> 00:11:04.998 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
to the area around
the Black Sea,

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:08.668 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
and to a place where we
have some information from,

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.169 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
which is the Scythian culture--

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:12.505 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
which not many
people talk about--

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.216 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
they also were supposed to
be claimed to have been older

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:16.134 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
than the Egyptians.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.970 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
And part of their culture
wasn't just humanoid.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.722 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
They were also a godly culture.

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.849 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
And they're also described
as being very tall,

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.350 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
almost like giants--

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.020 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
again, sometimes with
the elongated skull.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.023 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
And they're supposed
to be wisdom keepers.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.858 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
&gt;&gt; Here is what
I think happened.

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:37.989 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
Possibly somewhere in the Altai
Mountains of Southern Siberia

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:42.076 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
around 45,000 years
ago, at this time

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.746 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
the area was occupied
by the Denisovans.

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:48.041 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
Let's assume that they
were extremely tall, very

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:52.545 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
well built. If you can imagine
the biggest Russian wrestlers

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:57.634 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
that you can think of and
then cover them in furs

00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:01.721 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
and give them wisdom of
200,000 years, that's

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.640 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
what we're talking about here.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.518 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
If you can imagine that their
race is probably dying out--

00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:10.021 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
in other words, their
population might not

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:12.899 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
have been so large
as it once was--

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.776 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
and yet, they have this
incredible knowledge,

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.945 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
this incredible wisdom now.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:22.075 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
And they get to hear about
these new people arriving out

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:25.536 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
of the direction
of the setting sun.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:27.080 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
They're much smaller.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.498 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
They look different.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.875 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
Their skin may be a
slightly different color.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:34.587 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
And they know that they're
gradually moving eastwards.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:37.840 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
They're gradually taking
over one territory and then

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.175 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:12%
the next.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:43.262 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
They would exploit the
resources and just move on.

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:47.016 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
And then one day,
these people turn up

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:52.230 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:47%
and there's a first encounter
between our own ancestors, Homo

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.525 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
sapiens, and the Denisovans.

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:59.237 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
I think if I was a Denisovan at
this point, I would be saying,

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:02.907 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
I think our time's up, and
we have to change our ways.

00:13:02.907 --> 00:13:05.952 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
And one of the
possibilities is that there

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:09.831 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
was an understanding
the new people

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:13.084 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
and the Denisovans that
this ancient wisdom,

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:18.172 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:46%
this ancient knowledge would now
be carried into the new world

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.341 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
through hybrid descendants.

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.468 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
In other words, we
would interbreed.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.387 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
And it would be through
our descendants,

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:28.141 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
our hybrid descendants, that
this ancient wisdom would now

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.185 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
be disseminating.

00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:33.062 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
&gt;&gt; Could this be true?

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:36.149 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
The Siberian fossil
remains found in Altai

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:39.736 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
have challenged scientists to
re-examine the transformation

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.447 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:21%
of human DNA.

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:46.743 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; There's been an explosion of
new information in this field,

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:51.414 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:45%
partly thanks to new genetic
sequencing techniques and deep

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:52.707 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
analysis of DNA.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.793 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
And it's clear that the
story of the evolution

00:13:55.793 --> 00:14:00.298 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
of anatomically modern humans
is much more complicated.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:02.842 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
The DNA breakthrough
is we now know

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:06.220 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
that our anatomically modern
human ancestors interbred

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.138 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
with Neanderthals.

00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:11.142 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
So we are a mixture of
Neanderthals and the creature

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.394 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
that became anatomically
modern humans.

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:16.314 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
And then adding further
complication to the picture,

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:20.443 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
Denisovan DNA is also found in
the anatomically modern human

00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:21.527 align:center line:0 position:50% size:13%
genome--

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:25.948 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
trace elements in some areas,
quite large amounts in others.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:30.828 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
&gt;&gt; The Denisovans passed to us
various genes which have been

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:33.122 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
important in our
own development.

00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:36.959 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
For instance, in the
Tibetan Plateau, the Sherpas

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.629 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
and the indigenous people
there, their ability

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:43.841 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
to be able to spend long periods
in extremely high altitudes

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:48.513 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
comes from a gene which
was inherited, we now know,

00:14:48.513 --> 00:14:50.890 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
from the Denisovans.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.725 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
There were other
genes, as well, to do

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.103 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
with our appearance,
our intellect,

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:59.732 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
and our consciousness
were also first developed

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:04.403 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
through the idea of
this hybridization.

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:06.989 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
There are many
modern populations

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:11.536 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
around the world that have
high levels of Denisovan

00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:15.206 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
DNA within their genes.

00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:22.338 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
We're talking about India,
Southeast Asia, Java,

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:27.301 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
Australia, Melanesia,
Micronesia,

00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:33.933 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
various Native American
peoples in Canada, in Mexico,

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:38.229 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
also in the northern
part of South America

00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:40.356 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
have all got Denisovan DNA.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:45.278 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
These are all the descendants
of the Denisovans.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:48.447 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
&gt;&gt; If Denisovans roamed the
earth for thousands of years

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.658 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
crossbreeding with
other sapiens,

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:54.412 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
it could explain how traces
of their DNA have been found

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:59.542 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
thousands of miles from
Siberia in North America.

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:03.629 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; It is almost certain that
the Denisovans and their hybrid

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:07.717 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
descendants ended up
coming in to the Americas.

00:16:07.717 --> 00:16:13.014 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
Indeed, it's now been found
that in several different Native

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:19.103 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
American peoples,
Denisovan DNA exists.

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:25.026 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
This proves that they
were the giants of legend

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:29.572 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
and that they are responsible
for the human skeletons,

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.532 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
the oversized human
skeletons that

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:35.870 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
are found in mound complexes
all over North America.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.873 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; I think we're just at
the beginning of the process

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:43.252 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
of unraveling the mystery
of what all of this means.

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:46.964 align:center line:0 position:50% size:26%
It's almost heretical
to say so in context

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:49.175 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
of modern anthropology,
but I think

00:16:49.175 --> 00:16:52.845 align:center line:0 position:50% size:38%
we're going to have to revisit
the Out of Africa model.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:55.473 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
It may be that
the evolution that

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.850 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
led to anatomically
modern humans

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.436 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
didn't take place
entirely in Africa.

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:03.356 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
We're looking at actually
a very complicated picture

00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:05.358 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
that ultimately results in us.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.151 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
No Denisovans live today.

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:08.569 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
No Neanderthals live today.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:12.615 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
We are the sole survivors
of that intermingling

00:17:12.615 --> 00:17:15.034 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
of slightly different,
and sometimes very

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.536 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
different-looking but
genetically close,

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.789 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
human species.

00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:22.625 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
&gt;&gt; If DNA is only
part of the puzzle,

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:25.670 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
Freddy Silva suggests
looking into the mythology

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.838 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:18%
of the giants.

00:17:27.838 --> 00:17:32.176 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
&gt;&gt; I'm very much of the opinion
that ancient myth always holds

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:34.303 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
a large kernel of truth.

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:37.181 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
The myths are so concise,
so well developed, so

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.849 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
beautifully illustrated.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.643 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
Native Americans
talk about the giants

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:42.520 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
roaming the face of
the earth as easily

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.938 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
as they talk about aliens.

00:17:43.938 --> 00:17:45.356 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
For them, it's not a big deal.

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:47.775 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
It's like, well, of course
there were, just like there were

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:49.068 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
big lizards here at one point.

00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.404 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
So why not humans as well?

00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.072 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
I believe they are
telling us something.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.491 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
And that one thing that they
keep telling us over and over

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.702 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
again is the fact
that the earth is

00:17:57.702 --> 00:17:59.620 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
an experimental weigh station.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.206 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
And it goes through
cycles, long cycles.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:10.631 align:center line:0 position:50% size:46%
&gt;&gt; All over the world, we have
accounts of human remains being

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:14.343 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
found that are of giant stature.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.387 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
So are these Denisovans?

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:19.056 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
Well, we don't know.

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:21.976 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
The reason why we don't
know is because all those

00:18:21.976 --> 00:18:25.813 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
found in North America
have been repatriated

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:31.902 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
as part of the NAGPRA law that
allowed all of the bones, all

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:35.531 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
the millions of them in
all the different museums

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:40.369 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
to be given back to the First
Nations and Native American

00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:45.666 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
peoples for them to rebury them
in their own burial grounds.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.376 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
So we haven't got anything.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:50.212 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
There isn't any giant
bones in North America

00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:51.714 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
that we can look at.

00:18:51.714 --> 00:18:54.717 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
So I'm afraid to say that
we can't analyze them.

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:59.889 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
What we can say is that
some of the first peoples

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:04.018 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
to arrive in the North American
continent came from Siberia,

00:19:04.018 --> 00:19:10.900 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
the very same area where the
Denisovan remains were found.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.111 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
&gt;&gt; If this is true, could this
species have come from a much

00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:15.488 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:19%
older lineage?

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.865 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
Linda Moulton Howe
shares her theory

00:19:17.865 --> 00:19:22.119 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:48%
on how Denisovan DNA could have
been genetically manipulated

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:25.831 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
by the Anunnaki.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:31.253 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
&gt;&gt; Why is it that the
Denisovans went extinct

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:35.007 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
and neanderthalensis
went extinct,

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:39.136 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:48%
leaving Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens
sapien to dominate Planet

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:40.638 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:9%
Earth?

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:45.643 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
Was that the objective of an
extraterrestrial experiment?

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:51.232 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
So maybe there is an overlap
of other intelligences using

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:56.487 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
this planet that is
responsible for our confusion

00:19:56.487 --> 00:20:00.783 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
today, looking back through
time trying to understand,

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:01.909 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:18%
who are we?

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:06.580 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
And maybe this whole
huge story about all

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.291 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
of these different
bloodlines has

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.711 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
to do with genetic manipulation
that Planet Earth has

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:15.089 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
been used like a laboratory--

00:20:15.089 --> 00:20:19.802 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
but not by just one,
who knows how many--

00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:24.223 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
and that we humans today
trying to understand who we are

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:28.018 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
and going back and looking
at all these civilizations.

00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:33.023 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
I remember that I started
going out and doing searches--

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:37.903 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
like going to look at the map,
where is this in Siberia--

00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:40.990 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
and realizing that
where this cave is

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.702 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
and where this new
brand of human was

00:20:44.702 --> 00:20:46.996 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
is a place where
there have been UFO

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:51.584 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
stories in and around this area
in Siberia for a long time.

00:20:51.584 --> 00:20:55.963 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
And I started thinking,
wow, could this really truly

00:20:55.963 --> 00:21:00.426 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
be an example of one of these
experiments that is being

00:21:00.426 --> 00:21:02.720 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
done by extraterrestrials?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.975 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
And the discovery
reinforces this idea.

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:12.313 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
It is a branch of
humans that has

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:16.775 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
an antecedent with something
completely unknown.

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:19.695 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
&gt;&gt; This might explain how
Homo sapiens have survived

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.822 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
for as long as they have.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:26.619 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
Perhaps an ancient code has
been embedded in our DNA.

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:30.289 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
Andrew Collins suggests that
the migration of the Denisovans

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:35.753 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
also points to ancient
areas considered as portals.

00:21:35.753 --> 00:21:41.842 align:center line:0 position:50% size:37%
&gt;&gt; The earliest hybrid
descendants of Denisovans

00:21:41.842 --> 00:21:47.890 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
spread out from a central area,
which was probably Southern

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:56.148 align:center line:0 position:50% size:42%
Siberia, and reached various
whitewood points in the planet,

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:59.318 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
and that they set
them up as markers.

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:03.989 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
They set them up as portals
of contacts and connection

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:07.451 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
with the stars and
with the other world,

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:11.914 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:45%
and possibly even what we might
call today parallel dimensions.

00:22:11.914 --> 00:22:14.083 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
Now, where were these points?

00:22:14.083 --> 00:22:19.088 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
Places like Gobekli Tepe,
or certainly the area around

00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:21.674 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
Gobekli Tepi in
Southeast Turkey,

00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:26.512 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
the area around Giza in
Egypt, and other places--

00:22:26.512 --> 00:22:31.308 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
like Stonehenge in England,
certain places obviously

00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:35.062 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
in China, India, et
cetera, et cetera--

00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:38.107 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
they've become points
of communication, points

00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:42.945 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
of contact that people would
be able to return to again

00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:45.656 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
and again and again.

00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:49.535 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; Not only did they build all
of these megalithic structures,

00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:53.330 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
but they built them in areas
that we call vortex zones.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:59.587 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
These are areas where ley lines
on the Earth with the Earth's

00:22:59.587 --> 00:23:02.339 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
natural energy grid
cross one another.

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:05.384 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
In ancient times they
were called dragon lines.

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:07.761 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
Almost every one of
these ancient structures

00:23:07.761 --> 00:23:12.683 align:center line:0 position:50% size:40%
is built on top of places where
ley lines cross one another.

00:23:12.683 --> 00:23:14.476 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
That's important,
because where they

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:19.231 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
cross one another you have
amazing electromagnetic waves

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:23.694 align:center line:0 position:50% size:41%
being produced, hugely
strong electromagnetic waves.

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:26.947 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
And wherever you have
electromagnetic waves that

00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:29.199 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
are that strong,
you can basically

00:23:29.199 --> 00:23:33.287 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
have a tear, a rip in the
electromagnetic membrane

00:23:33.287 --> 00:23:36.749 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
that separates this
dimension from the next.

00:23:36.749 --> 00:23:39.918 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
And this is something that's
accepted in modern day science.

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:42.171 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
The only thing that's
separating our dimension

00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:45.049 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
that we're sitting
here talking in

00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:47.968 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:45%
is an electromagnetic membrane.

00:23:47.968 --> 00:23:50.512 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
These were creatures
who understood that,

00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:53.641 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
and they understood that by
building these structures

00:23:53.641 --> 00:23:57.144 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
right on top of these areas,
of which the Altai Mountains is

00:23:57.144 --> 00:24:01.649 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
one of them, they were
able to basically create

00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:03.067 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
a tear in that membrane.

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:06.236 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
And you can have
momentary interaction

00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:09.406 align:center line:0 position:50% size:34%
between the dimensions.

00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:14.036 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
&gt;&gt; If this is true, could the
area around the Altai Mountains

00:24:14.036 --> 00:24:17.539 align:center line:0 position:50% size:33%
have been a gateway for
not only the Denisovans,

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:21.710 align:center line:0 position:50% size:45%
but other intelligent life
that communicated with humans?

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.963 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
Sonja Grace points
to a stonehenge built

00:24:24.963 --> 00:24:27.758 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
in the same area as the cave.

00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:33.681 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
She suggests this might have
been constructed as a stargate.

00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:37.476 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
&gt;&gt; The Russian stonehenge,
it was very much like

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.645 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
the Stonehenge of the UK.

00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:42.773 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
It was huge megalithic stones.

00:24:42.773 --> 00:24:44.108 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
It was more elaborate.

00:24:44.108 --> 00:24:45.943 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
There were more stones.

00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:49.947 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
And I saw a
ceremonial procession

00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:52.783 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
of women who entered
the circle first,

00:24:52.783 --> 00:24:56.161 align:center line:0 position:50% size:36%
and they went around in a
counter-clockwise position.

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:58.497 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
Then the men entered
and they went around

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:00.582 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
in a clockwise position.

00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:03.502 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
And the ceremonies that
were done at this site

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:06.255 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
were exactly what was
done at Stonehenge.

00:25:06.255 --> 00:25:08.674 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
They were for fertility.

00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:14.054 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
This incredible
place was a portal

00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:16.557 align:center line:0 position:50% size:32%
very much in the same
way Salisbury Plain had

00:25:16.557 --> 00:25:18.350 align:center line:0 position:50% size:25%
a huge portal on it.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.396 align:center line:0 position:50% size:30%
And the people of this
time were interacting

00:25:22.396 --> 00:25:27.109 align:center line:0 position:50% size:43%
with the demigods who I call the
Ancient Ones, the Pleiadians,

00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:29.570 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
And the Pleiadians
did exactly for them

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.780 align:center line:0 position:50% size:29%
what they did for
the people of the UK.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.366 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
They brought them
their ceremonies.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.202 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
They taught them
the ancient ways.

00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:40.873 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
And when I stood in the
middle of this stonehenge,

00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:42.541 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:21%
it was amazing.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:44.084 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
It was like the portal--

00:25:44.084 --> 00:25:47.629 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
I could look up and
see into the portal.

00:25:47.629 --> 00:25:49.715 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
And it was just like a wormhole.

00:25:49.715 --> 00:25:53.051 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
And what they told me was
that this wormhole went up

00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:57.389 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
to Pleiades, but it
actually went past Pleiades.

00:25:57.389 --> 00:26:00.893 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
And so this is why there's
all kinds of UFO activity

00:26:00.893 --> 00:26:02.060 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:16%
in the area.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.813 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
There's other beings
accessing this portal

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:08.942 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
and coming through
to Earth in that way.

00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:11.862 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:37%
&gt;&gt; Could scientists have
stumbled across an ancient

00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:14.239 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
gateway to another world?

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:19.036 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
And if so, how will this
discovery shape our future?

00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:21.038 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
What other discoveries
will come out

00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:23.665 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
within the next few
years that will push

00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:27.920 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
our understanding of humanity?

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.091 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; When we go back in time
and we look at the evolution

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:39.765 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
of species on Earth, we have
all these different time periods

00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:41.642 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
that we can examine.

00:26:41.642 --> 00:26:44.728 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:26%
But it's very difficult
for us as a species

00:26:44.728 --> 00:26:46.313 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:33%
to see the whole picture.

00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:47.898 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
It's like a bunch
of puzzle pieces

00:26:47.898 --> 00:26:50.275 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
that we're still
trying to put together.

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:52.027 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:24%
And as the puzzle
comes together,

00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:55.322 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
we start to solve more
and more about our origins

00:26:55.322 --> 00:26:57.533 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
and where we come from.

00:26:57.533 --> 00:27:02.079 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
If we have five species that
haven't been discovered yet

00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:05.666 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
and we have the Denisovans
and the Neanderthals,

00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:11.213 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
we would be the culmination
of those seven species coming

00:27:11.213 --> 00:27:12.422 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:12%
together.

00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:17.719 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
Our beings, our bodies
now are that creation.

00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:21.640 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
And in that creation, it's
related to the seven chakras.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.726 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
So as each species
came through, it

00:27:24.726 --> 00:27:29.064 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:30%
was literally activating
in every human form

00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:34.444 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
a progression in the chakras
to where we will eventually

00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:37.281 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:23%
realize all seven.

00:27:37.281 --> 00:27:41.660 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
In other words, each
species has brought

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.957 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
about an awareness or an
activation of that chakra.

00:27:46.957 --> 00:27:49.793 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
Of course, at the beginning of
time it was the first chakra.

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:52.880 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
And the next species that came
in, it was the second chakra.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.343 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
And we've worked our way up
through a much longer frame

00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:01.513 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
than one can think
through the chakras

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:06.560 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
to where we are activating and
becoming aware of that center.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.021 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
But it's up to us
to actually come

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:13.942 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
into full realization
of all seven chakras.

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:16.987 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
When we would start a
new phase of humanity,

00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:20.157 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
the demigods would come
through and they would actually

00:28:20.157 --> 00:28:22.534 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
cross-pollinate with the people.

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:25.787 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
So we have the influence
of them, as well.

00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:30.083 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
And we're constantly in
this evolutionary process,

00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:36.048 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:42%
trying to put something in front
of ourselves that makes sense.

00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:39.343 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
But it's so multi-dimensional,
it's hard to see.

00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:45.599 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; Perhaps archeologists and
scientists have just scratched

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:49.561 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:46%
the surface in the lineage of
human DNA and where it might be

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.438 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:9%
going.

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:53.315 align:center line:0 position:50% size:24%
&gt;&gt; It might not be
so obvious to us,

00:28:53.315 --> 00:28:55.776 align:center line:0 position:50% size:35%
because we live on a very
day-to-day basis in a very

00:28:55.776 --> 00:28:57.402 align:center line:0 position:50% size:27%
short period of time.

00:28:57.402 --> 00:29:00.030 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
But I do believe that
we adapt as a species,

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.407 align:center line:0 position:50% size:39%
and I think that that
adaptation is happening right

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:03.909 align:center line:0 position:50% size:31%
as we speak right now.

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:06.036 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
We have climate
change that's upon us.

00:29:06.036 --> 00:29:09.831 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:43%
How are humans going to look
50, 100, 1,000 years from now?

00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:11.333 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
I bet they will
look much different.

00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:13.210 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:28%
I think it's all relative.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.795 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:31%
There was a time
when the Neanderthals

00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:15.921 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
were relative to the Earth.

00:29:15.921 --> 00:29:18.215 align:center line:0 position:50% size:28%
There was a time
when 15-foot people

00:29:18.215 --> 00:29:19.716 align:center line:0 position:50% size:35%
were relative to the Earth.

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:22.344 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
And the time for Homo
sapiens also came along.

00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:24.763 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
Mainstream archeology
will not go any further

00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:27.641 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
than the layer of
about 1,000 BC,

00:29:27.641 --> 00:29:30.811 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
because you might just find
something that will completely

00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:34.064 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
upend the entire notion
of where we come from

00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:36.942 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
and who would really are,
and how old we really are.

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:39.861 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:38%
&gt;&gt; I think it's a much
more complicated story than

00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:40.988 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:22%
we've imagined.

00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:45.659 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
And I must say, the advances
in DNA and in genetic work

00:29:45.659 --> 00:29:49.371 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
are incredibly important
in solving this problem.

00:29:49.371 --> 00:29:51.456 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
We're now having to consider
the possibility there

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:55.210 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:45%
were multiple human-like species
that existed on the planet.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.006 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
We're the only ones that
are left, as far as we know.

00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:02.926 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
&gt;&gt; Our evolutionary process
within our minds is what now

00:30:02.926 --> 00:30:04.428 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
needs to catch up.

00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:07.514 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
This is why we're trying to put
all the pieces of the puzzle

00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:10.600 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
back together, so
that we can understand

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.269 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
what our origins are--

00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:14.104 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:44%
and really, where we need to go.

00:30:14.104 --> 00:30:17.649 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
We're not there yet,
but we're close.

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:22.154 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:40%
&gt;&gt; If we are just beginning to
understand our origins on this

00:30:22.154 --> 00:30:25.198 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
planet, what will
we discover next?

00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:28.910 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:34%
And how will that change
the course of humanity?

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:33.874 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:46%
Does our evolution depend on the
consciousness of this planet?

00:30:33.874 --> 00:30:38.503 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:36%
Will the past unlock our
hidden code of potentiality,

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:41.757 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
and will we be able to
survive as a species

00:30:41.757 --> 00:30:45.552 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
here on Earth and
throughout the stars?

00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:49.473 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:29%
If we look all around
us, we see patterns--

00:30:49.473 --> 00:30:54.644 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:41%
patterns in nature reflected
on ancient monuments, codes

00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:59.858 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:39%
in ancient languages, stories
depicted about our past

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:02.569 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
and who might have
influenced it.

00:31:02.569 --> 00:31:07.282 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:32%
Who are we, and where
did we come from?

00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:09.659 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:27%
These are the
primordial questions

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:12.454 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
we tried to answer
in this series.

00:31:12.454 --> 00:31:17.417 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
But the answer is still
out there, carved in stone,

00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:22.881 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:35%
buried below the surface,
and right before our eyes.

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:22.923 align:center line:-1 position:50% size:25%
