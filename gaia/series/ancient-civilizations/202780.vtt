00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>> 60 miles North of Luxor on
the West Bank of the Nile is

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.840 align:middle line:90%
a town called Dendera.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And it is here in
December of 1798

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:84%
that Napoleon's troops stumbled
upon a temple buried in sand.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.190 align:middle line:84%
The men, stopping for a
rest, admired the ornate top

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of a once great temple.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
But a curious artist by the
name of Dominique Vivant Denon

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
jumped off his horse
with a sketch pad

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and fumbled his way through
the submerged gates.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
His curiosity led to one of
the greatest discoveries.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.340 align:middle line:84%
What he and the troops
had stumbled upon

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:84%
was the Temple of Hathor at
Dendera and, more importantly,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:90%
a depiction of a zodiac.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Could the beauty of this
temple hide within its walls

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:84%
the brains behind the
workings in the universe

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:90%
and the timeline of humanity?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
>> When Napoleon's
savants reached Dendera,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:90%
they went inside.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And under the leadership
of a man named Denon,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
they went into the
upper chambers.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was a very
dark, small chapel.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And when Denon looked
up with his torch,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
he saw that on the ceiling was
this astronomical depiction

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:90%
of the sky in circular form.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's become known
as the Dendera zodiac.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:10%
And around this in symbolic
form is the 12 signs

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:10%
of the zodiac along with
various other constellations

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:10%
and then other figures beyond
this in a circle representing

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:10%
the 36 so-called deacons.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
These are the gods
and goddesses who

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:84%
would have represented each
one 10 days of the year,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:90%
creating 360 in all.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>> This discovery sparked the
interest of archaeologists all

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.940 align:middle line:84%
At the time, no one was able
to translate hieroglyphs.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And this zodiac was
hope that finally they

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
would have a date of when
ancient Egypt was built.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
However, the mystery of this
great temple kept unraveling.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.960 align:middle line:10%
>> When the Dendera zodiac
first emerged in Paris,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.500 align:middle line:10%
it caused an absolute
sensation because it seemed

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.430 align:middle line:10%
to the scholars originally
that it pushed back the dating

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:10%
of human civilization tens
of thousands of years.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And it introduced the dreaded
A word into the conversation

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:90%
about ancient Egypt.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And the A word, of course, is
Atlantis, because the scholars

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:84%
are looking at this and
saying this zodiac talks

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:84%
about civilization going back
tens of thousands of years.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
There is no civilization
tens of thousands

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:90%
of years ago except Atlantis.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And so still that's
a perspective that

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:84%
is held by many that, in
fact, the Dendera zodiac

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
was there to
specifically tell us

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that there have been previous
human civilizations on Earth

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:84%
going back many
thousands of years.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The zodiac is believed
to depict ancient astrology

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and time periods from as far
back as 14,000 years ago.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva points out
that there is actually

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
another unique date
depicted in its construct.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And this marks the original
building of the temple

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:90%
before the most recent version.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It had been there for so
long, it had been rebuilt,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:90%
rebuilt, and added to over time.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:10%
And it's miraculous
what the Greeks

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.642 align:middle line:10%
did to rebuild the temple.

00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:25.600 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people say
this is a Greek temple.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's not.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:10%
The Greeks rebuilt
what was really there

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.640 align:middle line:10%
and they restored it
to what we see today.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
incredible finds

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.160 align:middle line:84%
was that they discovered
there was a complete obsession

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.985 align:middle line:90%
with the sky.

00:04:35.985 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And that tells
you everything you

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:90%
need to know about the origins.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you look very
closely and if you

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:84%
follow the constellations,
because they're all

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.260 align:middle line:84%
marked on there,
each one of them

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
behaves like an ever
decreasing spiral--

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:90%
not a circle.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiral that
goes to the center.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And the center's
marked by a big calf.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you happen to look at
where the calf's leg points

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to the first constellation,
in that zodiac

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
is a constellation
of Cancer, the Crab.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And that tells you
about the origins

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
because the
constellation of the Crab

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
which is now in the time
period of about 8,000

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.790 align:middle line:84%
BC, which just happens to be
the time period when agriculture

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and civilization
mysteriously appears

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt the first time,
which also happens to coincide

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
with the time period when the
followers of Horus, the Shining

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Ones, appear after the
flood along the Nile,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
rebuilding the temples and
adding their information

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:90%
to the temples.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.635 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect that Dendera
was one of those sites.

00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:39.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If Dendera was an ancient
site depicting astrologically

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
humans on Earth,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is it possible this temple
also connects its origins

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:90%
to the stars?

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Mythology has it there
wasn't just one Hathor.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.390 align:middle line:90%
There were seven.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:84%
The myth of seven
goddesses, however, is not

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:90%
just connected to this temple.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
It has its origins
all over the world.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
these female deities

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
that the temple was named after
were otherworldly in nature?

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.960 align:middle line:10%
According to Egyptian
archaeologist Abdelrahman Amin

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:10%
in his book titled "Dendera,
Land of the Goddess Hathor,"

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:10%
he concludes from
several studies

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:10%
that the temple is on an azimuth
of 18 degrees negative 7, which

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:10%
aligns its structure to
the Ursa Major stars.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
This is an unusual alignment
for a temple in Egypt.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
But Anton Parks explains
that this star system known

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.590 align:middle line:84%
as the Great Bear is connected
to a lineage of divine females

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.490 align:middle line:84%
that came to Earth
thousands of years ago.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:84%
He connects their lineage
back to the Sumerian God Enki

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:58.850 align:middle line:84%
or, as he calls him, Sa'am,
and the goddess named Nammu.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.000 align:middle line:10%
>> At this point in the story,
Nammu and Sa'am leave the Great

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.030 align:middle line:10%
Bear, the Great
Bear constellation,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.435 align:middle line:10%
to go to the Pleiades in order
to execute what was planned

00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:13.235 align:middle line:10%
by the Marduku.

00:07:13.235 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:84%
They must create a large
quantity of amashutum--

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.690 align:middle line:84%
of amashutum priestesses who
will help them in their work.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
They will create 82
amashutum to work

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:84%
with the land in
plantations for one part

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and with the small
cattle on the other part.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Their role in the
story is significant,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:90%
because they have great powers.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
They are allowed to clone
under certain conditions.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
They are scattered
throughout the universe.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:84%
They are on Earth
but they are also

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:84%
in the Great Bear, the
Pleiades, and quite a few places

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, could this
temple be aligned to Ursa Major

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
to point to the origins
of the goddesses?

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient cultures
have a similar mythology

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:84%
of seven goddesses that
come from the Pleiades.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this connection comes
full circle here in Dendera,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:84%
a reminder that their origins
stretch from one star system

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.730 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Over many years, I've
collected a lot of artifacts.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And all of these ancient
artifacts, the majority of them

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
depict something called
the Seven Sisters.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty interesting that
when you go into ancient texts,

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:10%
you discover that a lot
of these civilizations

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:10%
supposedly started
in the Pleiadian star

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.065 align:middle line:10%
system, which is where you
have the Seven Sisters.

00:08:39.065 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
It's been mentioned
in Homer's "Iliad."

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.065 align:middle line:84%
It's been mentioned
in the Bible.

00:08:42.065 --> 00:08:45.100 align:middle line:90%
Many other texts as well.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:10%
But what's interesting is the
Aboriginal people of Australia

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:10%
also say that they were
the first people seated

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:10%
on this planet by
the Pleiadians.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:10%
So this Ursa Major plays
a very, very major role

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.483 align:middle line:10%
at the Temple of Dendera
and also maybe even seeding

00:08:58.483 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:10%
human beings on this planet.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:10%


00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.560 align:middle line:10%
>> The mission of the
seven Hathors is to bring

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:10%
a consciousness
level to the people.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So in our world, there are
seven women, or seven goddesses,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
or seven deities that
represent Pleiades.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleiadians are
instrumental in helping

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
create various civilizations
around the world.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:10%
They have always helped Earth,
coming here and creating

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:10%
new civilizations,
cross-pollinating with people,

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:10%
and helping other demigods to
create a new phase of humanity.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:10%
These seven women, or seven
goddesses, the seven Hathors

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:10%
are represented around the
world in various religions

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:10%
and cultures.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
The sistrum was
used in a ceremony

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:84%
to actually activate
through sound

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.230 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of Pleiades.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
important instrument

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
that the Hathors
were in charge of.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And they all played the sistrum
to bring about the vibration

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:90%
of their home, Pleiades.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> This otherworldly vibration
seems to have an effect even

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
today as people walk through
the great hypostyle hall.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Was it possibly built
to hold the frequency

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of these otherworldly
beings in hopes they

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:90%
would be able to help humanity?

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Anton Parks believes
a machine used

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:84%
to travel
interdimensionally happens

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
to reside in another dimension
of existence in the temple

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.960 align:middle line:84%
This in turn gives off
its strange frequency.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> According to my
understanding of the story,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
this is the place where
the zeta machine would be.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the well-known
counter rotating

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.205 align:middle line:90%
machine on the site of Dendera.

00:11:07.205 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I have visited
Dendera several times.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:10%
There are several areas that
are quite particular in Dendera.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:10%
When visiting the
site, we can feel

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.790 align:middle line:10%
that there are some
electromagnetic areas where

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:10%
you have the feeling your
legs are falling down,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:10%
where you feel really
tired, a headache.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Near the Dendera temple is
the House of the Phoenix.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think the zeta machine
is located right there.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When you go inside, right
away you come into this area

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
where there's two gigantic
granite slabs that are

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:90%
magnetized.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I took out my
camera to videotape this,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
I saw the magnetism
interfering with my camera.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:10%
There's a specific frequency
interacting with the magnetism

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.620 align:middle line:10%
there that gives you
this kind of a buzz

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:10%
that you can feel when
you're walking through.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is true, what kind
of frequency could be harnessed

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:90%
in this temple?

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Hathor represented our
relationship to sound,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps more specifically
to vibration,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
because there are some
vibrations that are important

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:90%
to us that cannot be heard.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.340 align:middle line:10%
And it was in this place
that we see Hathor actually

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:10%
applying the technology of
vibration in the earthly realm

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:10%
to healing as well as
to security and defense.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:10%
We see Hathor holding
back the beings that

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.370 align:middle line:10%
are coming at her in force,
that want to hurt her,

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:10%
holding back with a force.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.670 align:middle line:84%
We see her healing
the body of those

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
that are brought to her
using the power of vibration,

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily
sound but vibration.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So Hathor now is associated
very, very closely

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:84%
with this technology
of sound, of vibration,

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship to sound
the vibration in our lives,

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
relationships that are only now
being revealed through the best

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.190 align:middle line:90%
science of the modern world.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> If this mysterious temple
has been encoded with not only

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:84%
the history of our human
existence but a frequency

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
generated by an
otherworldly source,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.210 align:middle line:84%
is it possible to
decode this power?

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Is such a sophisticated,
subtle, technologically advanced

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
understanding of our
relationship to the world,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
it transcends this polarity
between male and female.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:84%
They had gone beyond
those differences.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most mysterious
temples of Egypt is Dendera,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
because everything that you
can see in that temple is like

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:84%
an open book to understand
how the Egyptians inherit

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:84%
the information
from the Atlanteans.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.740 align:middle line:10%
And even if Dendera
itself didn't

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:10%
have this technology
and these physical tools

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:10%
to make the machine work
as Atlantis would do,

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:10%
they kept that information.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Hathor is the mother.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And for all ancient
civilizations,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
the main mother that gave
milk for many people,

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:90%
for many animals was the cow.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Hathor was this feminine aspect
with cow-like ears and eyes.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing about this temple

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is that by the
building of itself,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:84%
it's talking about the
history of our interpretation

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:90%
of the mother.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is also why still today
we call our galaxy Milky Way,

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:84%
because it was the way of
milk and the path of milk

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that this great cow was
living in the cosmos.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
We can see all the
constellations.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And all these
constellations are our hold

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.860 align:middle line:84%
by 12 columns with
the head of Hathor

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.840 align:middle line:84%
looking into the four
directions of time and space.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:10%
So we have 12 columns
that holds the cosmos.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
This 12 represents the
12 directions in which

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:90%
a sphere observe the reality.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.910 align:middle line:84%
The 12 directions are
the faces and the nodes

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:90%
of the icosahedron.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
The icosahedron is
a structure that

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:84%
has 12 nodes that
points into the sky.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So 12 is the most
important code that we

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
could have to understand
the different perspective

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:90%
of a sphere.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:10%
So by this we also can find many
of the codes of the universe.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.170 align:middle line:84%
The 12 faces of the
planet are facing

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:90%
towards 12 constellations.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.910 align:middle line:10%
These 12 constellations
are the ones

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:10%
that represents the
power of the self being

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:10%
imprinted in the reality.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.790 align:middle line:10%
This means that when the
spirit wants to be born,

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:10%
they have to go through
the 12 of these phases

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:10%
of the universe, the 12
constellations, and taking

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:10%
something from each one of them
in order to get into this fear

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.940 align:middle line:10%
that we call Earth, the
planet, or the sphere

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.050 align:middle line:10%
that we call the womb.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So the personality,
the being, the soul

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:84%
needs to have the potential
of these 12 constellations

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:90%
in order to come down.

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
This is why the
teachings of Dendera

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.060 align:middle line:84%
was astronomy and
astrology, to understand

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
how the universe moves,
how the Milky Way moves,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and how we are created
by these stars.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:90%
The other thing is vibration.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.930 align:middle line:84%
12 vibrations, which is related
with the 12 notes of music.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:84%
These 12 vibrations are also
a projection of geometry.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
If we count the position
12, we will find that 144.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
So this means that when you
reach the 144 vibrations

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.270 align:middle line:84%
in the code of the truth, you
will find all the perspectives

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So all the vibrations are
encoded in just the 12 columns.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:10%
So 144 represents the
vibration of the main structure

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:10%
that we call the seed of life.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
The seed of life is the
structure of the octahedron.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And this octahedron
is just one aspect.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:90%
So one is matter.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.840 align:middle line:90%
The other one is energy.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
frequency, vibration.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So 144 as a seed of matter,
144 as a seed of energy,

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and 144 as the
seed of vibration.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
144 by 3, you will

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:84%
find 432, which is
the perfect vibration

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:84%
to align with the
heart, which is

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:90%
the main purpose of the temple--

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
to align with the
heart of the mother.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So 432 is the vibration
to accomplish to reach

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:90%
the core of this temple.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:10%
So by the vibration
432, we could

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.330 align:middle line:10%
reach the perfect
amount of migration

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:10%
to create energy in the void.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So when they created
energy in the void,

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.450 align:middle line:90%
they could enlight the cities.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:84%
They could enlight
everything just by vibration.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the free
energy that this temple

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:84%
is talking about is how to use
the directions of the universe

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.830 align:middle line:84%
in order to create
free energy, in order

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to use the flow of the Kundalini
that is in every matter,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:90%
in everything that exists.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Kundalini?

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
encoded in this temple

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
is not only the understanding
of how the universe works

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:84%
but the tools to return
back to whence we came

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago?

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:84%
In traditional yogic
practice, Kundalini

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:84%
is a hidden female
energy believed

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
to lie coiled at the base
of the spine like a snake

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:84%
until released through
a series of practices.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:10%
Gregg Braden points to a
mysterious 13th zodiac.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is where it
gets really interesting,

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
because if you look closely at
the zodiac temple in Dendera,

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:09.770 align:middle line:84%
what we find is they did not
stop with 12 zodiac signs as we

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:90%
see today.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But there was a mysterious
13th zodiac sign

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:84%
is represented by the
serpent, the serpent

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
that, historically, we've
been taught represents evil.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.427 align:middle line:84%
But in the ancient
traditions, nothing

00:20:25.427 --> 00:20:26.760 align:middle line:90%
could be further from the truth.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It was a serpent that
represented the wisdom.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand the
wisdom of that 13th zodiac sign

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:84%
represented in the
Temple of Dendera

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
by Hathor and our relationship
to sound and vibration,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.500 align:middle line:84%
it opens up a whole
new way of us thinking

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, our
relationship to the cosmos,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and, perhaps most
importantly, the potential

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:90%
that lives within each of us.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The serpent has always been
a very powerful hermetic symbol

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
through all schools of awakening
and mystery schools across

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
In fact, until the
time of Christianity,

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
the serpent was considered a
symbol of the wisdom keepers.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't
help but notice

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:84%
that the DNA, the
genetics actually

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:84%
looks like serpentine strands,
like a ladder going up

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to heaven.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.470 align:middle line:10%
They also couldn't
help notice when

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.620 align:middle line:10%
they looked at the circuitry
of the nervous system

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.750 align:middle line:10%
that not only do we
have the central channel

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:10%
of the central
nervous system, but we

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.950 align:middle line:10%
have these two
nervous systems that

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:10%
move up and cross at every
single nodus or chakra that

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:10%
look very much like
entwined snakes.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:10%
>> If the wisdom of the
universe and our existence here

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:10%
on the planet seems to
vibrate from these walls,

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.340 align:middle line:10%
what might lie below
that may shed some light

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:10%
on the existence of the 13th
zodiac depicted as a snake?

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Underneath Dendera
are 12 crypts.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.730 align:middle line:10%
These were sealed
off storerooms that

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:10%
had extremely secret
imagery on them.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
In the one that we could
access until recent times,

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.140 align:middle line:84%
you go down a flight of stairs
where underneath the temple

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
you go through
this long corridor.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And there is what's referred
to as the Dendera light bulb.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.830 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's a
technological instrument.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.590 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a light bulb.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> We see two strange
light bulb-like objects.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Very large, because there
are human individuals

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:90%
by the side of them.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.840 align:middle line:84%
They seem to be
attached to these

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:84%
what can only be
described as leads

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:90%
that go away into the ground.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And from these leads
into the light bulbs are

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:84%
what appear to be
filaments, filaments

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.750 align:middle line:90%
represented by writhing snakes.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:10%
Now bear in mind that snakes
are actually a representation

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.040 align:middle line:10%
of the goddess Hathor herself.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:10%
But what exactly do these
so-called light bulbs

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:10%
represent?

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Are they examples of some
kind of lost technology

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:90%
that the ancients understood?

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, we obviously don't know.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't know whether
the ancient Egyptians

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:90%
had electricity.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
We certainly know that batteries
were being created in the Near

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.050 align:middle line:90%
East by around 500 BC.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But we do not know that the
Egyptians had electricity.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:34.695 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's something
more than this.

00:23:34.695 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If you happen to look at the
actual shape that we're looking

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.040 align:middle line:84%
at, it's basically a serpent
inside what looks like

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.540 align:middle line:84%
a filament bulb but at the
bottom of which is a plant.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the blue lotus.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.600 align:middle line:84%
The blue lotus was
the hallucinogen

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.950 align:middle line:90%
of choice for initiation.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And the halo around
it is what you're

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
seeing because that serpent
represents the energy that

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
comes out of the toxicology
that's found in the blue lotus.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:84%
The panel that we're looking at
is held up by the gent pillar.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.600 align:middle line:84%
The gent pillar essentially
is the backbone of life.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.320 align:middle line:10%
So just putting that
together, if you're

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:10%
taking a narcotic as an
initiate and this narcotic

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:10%
is part of the
blue lotus family,

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.890 align:middle line:10%
and this blue
Lotus is giving you

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.460 align:middle line:10%
the aura which is essentially
the energy that you're intaking

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:10%
as an initiate, that
serpent inside the aura

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.820 align:middle line:10%
is the energy that you're
imbibing as the initiate.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:10%
And from that, you are
held up by the backbone

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.440 align:middle line:10%
of the universe,
which represents

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:10%
the going into the other
world and the return journey.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.450 align:middle line:10%
It shows how the
initiate was placed

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.240 align:middle line:10%
in this really uncomfortable
womb-like situation.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And after three days, they
would go back up the stairs.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
They were taken up by the
priests, still feeling a bit

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:45.960 align:middle line:84%
groggy because you've
ingested a poison

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and you've just come back
from another level of reality.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing
you'd meet would

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.470 align:middle line:90%
be the sun at the equinox.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you were
declared risen from the dead.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this mysterious
temple of Dendera dedicated

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.870 align:middle line:84%
to the mother of the cosmos be
one of the last remaining books

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.130 align:middle line:84%
of the Atlantean knowledge and
our origins here on the planet?

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva points
out this is also

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:14.340 align:middle line:84%
one of the last remaining
feminine temples during a time

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.443 align:middle line:84%
when her wisdom was fading
from the minds of the people.

00:25:18.443 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greeks also realized that
the information was being lost.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.152 align:middle line:84%
So the only way they're
going to keep information

00:25:23.152 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
from disappearing
was to cover it back

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
onto the walls of the
temple, any temple associated

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.640 align:middle line:84%
with the creative
cycle of nature.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was particularly
important at a time

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:84%
when the world was becoming
so much more masculine.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
an era of conflict,

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.490 align:middle line:84%
of solar energy, the unbridled
solar ego and the domination

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
of empires over
others and so forth.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
horrible time to be in.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So to have this
wonderful moment where

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:84%
the feminine energy, the
flowing life force of nature,

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
is able to still survive amid
the sea of chaos was wonderful.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.900 align:middle line:10%
>> This is also a temple
dedicated to a very important

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:10%
divine force, a magnificent
machine able to bring

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:10%
the history of this place,
the history of this planet,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:10%
the history of the humankind
that has been signed

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:20.970 align:middle line:10%
in different moment of time
with very important significant

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:10%
historical moment.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.100 align:middle line:84%
So Dendera is not
only a monument.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.530 align:middle line:90%
But Dendera is still active.

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it possible from the
information we gleaned from

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:10%
Mattias that the temple is
encoded with the knowledge

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:42.290 align:middle line:10%
of the universe that makes
it alive in other dimensions?

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Could the machine that
Anton Parks explains

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.260 align:middle line:90%
even exist in this frequency?

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And can this frequency actually
be active today, a frequency

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.660 align:middle line:90%
from an otherworldly source?

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the frequency
might be defined as,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
the temple itself
left behind a timeline

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
of our existence on the
planet so that we would not

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.470 align:middle line:90%
forget our female lineage.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the mother of the
universe is beckoning you back

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:84%
from where you came
so you may understand

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
your true origin,
your true vibration,

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and your individual light
within the universe.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:31.000 align:middle line:90%
