Temple complex,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:84%
often referred to as the
Lost City of the Inca.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:10%
Machu Picchu is an astounding
feat of engineering

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:10%
and believed to have been
inhabited around 1420 to 1530.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But who else inhabited
this site long

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
before the Inca
civilization began building

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:84%
upon these foundational
wonders, when was it built,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and who shaped these megalithic
foundations have challenged

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:84%
alternative researchers
and scientists?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Evidence from several areas
of this sacred mountaintop

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
point to a pre-diluvian
interstellar connection.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:84%
As with all the legendary
relics on this planet,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:90%
this one contains many secrets.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:84%
What were our ancient ancestors
doing at this sacred site

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.185 align:middle line:84%
before the legendary
end of the world?

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:39.167 align:middle line:90%

>> When we think of the
mysteries of ancient

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:10%
civilizations in South
America, inevitably,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:10%
Machu Picchu comes to mind.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:10%
And even today, it remains
one of the most mysterious

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient sites
in the Southern Andes

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:10%
because the more
that is revealed

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:10%
and the more we discover,
the more mysterious the site

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:10%
becomes.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:10%
Hiram Bingham is the
man from Yale University

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.655 align:middle line:10%
that we say discovered
Machu Picchu in 1911.

00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Although, it was already
known to the locals,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
he discovered it for
the Western world.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
This site that was largely
overgrown and under the jungle

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
canopy, he could see portions
of Machu Picchu poking up

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.840 align:middle line:90%
above the canopy.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
It's right on the
edge of a rainforest,

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
so it is typically very
humid and very warm.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And that is why there was so
much overgrowth that was there.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And the first part
of the excavation

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:90%
was to clear that growth.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
They chose to do
it through fire.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So in 1912, the site
today that is Machu Picchu

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
was burned to
reveal just how much

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and how extensive
the site really is.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
mysteries really began.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:84%
From a geologic perspective,
the architecture

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and the way that
Machu Picchu was built

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and where it's situated
is fascinating.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.880 align:middle line:10%
>> When I went to
Machu Picchu in 2017,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:10%
what's very interesting is I saw
evidence of ancient structures

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:10%
underneath what's there now.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:84%
So this tells me what I've
seen all over the world,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, ancient cultures
built something megalithic

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and then another culture
comes after them, built

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:90%
something else on top of that.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And the higher you go as you're
coming closer to modern era,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:84%
you find that the
structure becomes smaller

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and smaller and smaller.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Now Machu Picchu is still an
amazing feat of technology.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.830 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
evidence there that

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
beneath what we
see with our eyes,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:84%
there is another
structure underneath that

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that's even older and more
megalithic, leading to the fact

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that these Incans actually
stumbled into that area

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and inherited what
was already there.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that they didn't
gain any knowledge by being

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.940 align:middle line:84%
there, but initially,
that area was

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
built by a culture even
far more ancient than them.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.760 align:middle line:10%
>> What impresses are the
stones used to build the city.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:10%
The working of the stones appear
unusual for an Inca knowledge.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:10%
The blocks are made of
granite containing quartzite.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the hardest
materials in nature.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:10%
And these blocks have
an average weight

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.710 align:middle line:10%
of 50 tons that were
cut and put together

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:10%
in such a precise
way that was totally

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.830 align:middle line:10%
unknown to the
local civilization.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:10%
Archeological evidences
show that the Inca

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:10%
didn't have precise device
to manage the granite.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:10%
That is why Machu
Picchu is an enigma.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:10%
But who built the city,
and why the city was built,

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:10%
and what was its
original function?

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Machu Picchu is clearly one
of the most important sites

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite unique.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Its placement within
the landscape,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
within the sacred valley,
all the beautiful mountains

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and scenery around
it, but it's really

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
what's built into it which
is the most important

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and especially the megalithic
aspect, the earlier

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.905 align:middle line:84%
foundation of the site, which
was later adopted by the Inca.

00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Speculation on what
this sacred site was used

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
for in our ancient past is
full of myth and legend.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Several areas of
this temple complex

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.020 align:middle line:84%
seem to have been constructed
by the Inca empire,

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
but the question
is, why did they

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:84%
build all of the smaller
stone walls and corridors

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
to encase the ancient
megalithic temple monuments?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:84%
Heroes on a spiritual
journey were surely

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
tested as they made their way
from the coasts of the South

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Pacific and climbed to nearly 1
and 1/2 miles above sea level.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But why was this sacred location
deep in the mountains of Peru

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:84%
chosen by our ancient
ancestors before the chaos

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:90%
began in the atmosphere?

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Machu Picchu is
built in a fault zone.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.390 align:middle line:10%
And it is built on the lower
portion of a fault zone,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:10%
literally on top of faults.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And the thinking
from the engineers

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:84%
today is that this may
have been intentional

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
because those faults allow
for drainage from the water,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:84%
as it's a rainforest,
draining away from the site

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than the site being
mired in puddles of water

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:90%
in the rainy season.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.320 align:middle line:10%
There are over 200
buildings in Machu Picchu

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:10%
proper, and more are still being
excavated as more of the site

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:10%
is being revealed
from undergrowth.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But of those 200 sites,
what we begin to see

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is that the architecture
is so very, very different

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
because it appears that
Machu Picchu is not

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:90%
built all at one time.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
There was a portion that
is very sophisticated, very

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.500 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated stonework,
similar to what we

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.360 align:middle line:84%
see in other parts
of Peru and what

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:84%
we see in Egypt, large massive
stone blocks that fit only

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.690 align:middle line:84%
where they are fitting with
the stone next to them.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:84%
They could not
fit anywhere else,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
with intricate detail
between the stones.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
There is less than 1/1000
of an inch tolerance

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and there's no mortar holding
these stones together.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:84%
What engineers have found
is that not only are

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
they intricately
interlocked, but they also

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:90%
are always built at an angle.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:90%
There's an offset to vertical.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
There are no vertical walls in
this old part of Machu Picchu.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
because by building

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:84%
at the offset with these
interlocking blocks,

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.050 align:middle line:90%
it makes them earthquake proof.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the reasons
in a geologic fault zone, where

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
there are earthquakes, why
these buildings have remained

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:90%
for as long as they have.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is the oldest
part of Machu Picchu.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Then there are other
parts of Machu Picchu

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:90%
that are obviously more recent.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And just as we see on
the Giza Plateau in Egypt

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
and throughout the rest
of Egypt, when the newer

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:84%
architecture was attempted,
whoever was attempting

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
it did not have the technology
to replicate the sophistication

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:90%
in the older buildings.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So they could never build
with the sophistication

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.929 align:middle line:84%
that we see in the older
portions of Machu Picchu.

00:08:31.929 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:10%
>> So there's a couple of bits
of evidence that suggest that

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:10%
there was a culture in Machu
Picchu even before the Inca.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.872 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the
construction styles,

00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
we find that there are three
distinct different kinds

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:90%
of constructions.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.570 align:middle line:84%
The oldest use these
polygonal-shaped stones

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that were surgically
placed without mortar.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It suggested that it was a
fairly advanced culture doing

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:84%
After that, there was a culture
carving structures straight out

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
of protruding bedrock that
they could build upon.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.455 align:middle line:84%
Finally, when the
Incas came in, they

00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:04.580 align:middle line:84%
were making use of the
structures that were already

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:84%
there, but the things
that they built

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
really weren't as
sophisticated or as nicely done

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:90%
as those two previous cultures.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Even the work of
Brien Foerster when

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:84%
he's talking to the Indigenous
people of Peru, those people

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
said, yes, there were cultures
here way before the Inca

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:84%
in Machu Picchu that were
creating these things

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:90%
and building.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
Incas came in, they

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.035 align:middle line:90%
built on what was already there.

00:09:27.035 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>> How could these stones
be cut so precisely?

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Could there have been a
scientific construction method

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:84%
used by the ancient pre-diluvian
gods thousands of years

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.330 align:middle line:90%
ago to shape these stones?

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Some scientists are
beginning to consider this,

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:84%
the poured stone theory for
portions of Machu Picchu,

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
the pulverizing of Native
stone, mixing with epoxy,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:84%
pouring it into molds to
achieve close tolerances between

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:84%
the stones and also to achieve
very unique shapes between

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:84%
the stones, where one stone had
to fit precisely to the stone

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:84%
next to it because no
other shape would fit.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the fascinating
things about Machu Picchu

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.522 align:middle line:90%
is there are no square corners.

00:10:16.522 --> 00:10:18.260 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very feminine.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Feminine-rounded
corners everywhere

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:90%
on all of the blocks.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And even the Temple of
the Sun is the only temple

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
in all of Machu Picchu
that has rounded

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
walls is aligned with the
sun for as a solstice marker,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
so we know precisely how it was
used and what it was used for.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of this
suggests that this

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:84%
may have been more
of a ceremonial site,

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and a ceremonial site
at least orchestrated

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:90%
from a feminine perspective.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that seems
evident is that Machu Picchu

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:90%
was a ritual/sacred site.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things
they found just outside

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.450 align:middle line:10%
of the main aspects
of Machu Picchu

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:10%
were these ritual baths so that
people could cleanse and purify

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.200 align:middle line:10%
themselves because when
you went to Machu Picchu,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:10%
you were stepping
on holy ground.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
You were stepping in
the land of the gods

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:84%
or the holy of
holies in this area.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And the ritual
baths really do let

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:84%
you know how sacred this
land was to these people.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at Machu Picchu
and we delve into the history

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:10%
of that civilization
that lived there,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:10%
we find evidence that instead
of being ruled by kings,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:10%
it was actually ruled by divine
feminine energy through a noble

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.330 align:middle line:10%
woman known as Coya Pasca
who is considered the consort

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient sun
god of the Inca.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:10%
And instead of being
based on ritual,

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:10%
it was based on
ceremony and practices.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
It looks like based
on the evidence

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
of studying that ancient
site, that instead

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
of being part of a
civilization that lived there,

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:84%
it was more of a
ceremonial aspect using

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:84%
the ancient temples to reach
higher divine states of energy

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So the question is,
who built Machu Picchu?

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big
part of the mystery

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:84%
because there are
many, many theories.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, we
do not know precisely

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.830 align:middle line:90%
who built Machu Picchu.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
we don't know is

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.560 align:middle line:84%
because there are no written
records in Machu Picchu.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Archeologists today often will
date an archeological site

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.510 align:middle line:84%
by carbon dating the
biological data that

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.960 align:middle line:84%
is found in that site, the
biological information.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Because we cannot
carbon date stone,

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.980 align:middle line:84%
we can only carbon date
something that has been alive--

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
when a biological organism
is living on Earth,

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:84%
it is absorbing carbon from the
environment, a very specific

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:90%
rate of absorption.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And when that organism dies,
that carbon begins to decay

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to release that
carbon at a very specific rate.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's based upon these ratios
that scientists can determine

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:90%
what's called carbon-14 dating.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.320 align:middle line:90%
You cannot do that with a stone.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The questions around the
date of construction for these

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
megalithic foundations remains
this mountain top's biggest

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:90%
mystery.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:84%
But another
architectural mystery

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.220 align:middle line:84%
found at this sacred
site may link it

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.505 align:middle line:84%
to several other ancient
pre-diluvian cultures,

00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:32.305 align:middle line:90%
the triptych.

00:13:32.305 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of the design
aspects of Machu Picchu.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And it appears to be in the
temple of the three windows.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.770 align:middle line:10%
These three windows
or kind of doorways

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:10%
are what are called
a triptych temple.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:10%
Now this is an
ancient tradition,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:10%
which is found all over
the world, where the two

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:10%
outer windows
appear to represent

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:10%
the sides of
ourselves, the lower

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.100 align:middle line:10%
parts of the human
kind of psyche,

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:10%
whereas the central
one represents

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:10%
the divine inner
part of our self.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
There's different variations
on this in different cultures,

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:84%
but this was adopted
throughout the world.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's found at many
megalithic sites, many Mayan

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:90%
sites as well in Mexico.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:90%
We find it in Egypt.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
We find it in traditions in
India and the Middle East.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And it even got adopted by the
Freemasons and the Rosicrucians

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:90%
as part of their tradition.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you're finding
these triptych designs

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:84%
in many different cultures
is quite interesting

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.210 align:middle line:84%
because we find it
not only in places

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:84%
like Machu Picchu and other
parts of Peru and Bolivia,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:84%
but we find it
very significantly

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
the Maya in Mexico.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
So is this another
connection proving

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
there may have been kind
of communication and ideas

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and even migrations between
these two ancient cultures?

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these temples found
at Machu Picchu provide a link

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to a vast cultural network
shared before the great deluge?

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.050 align:middle line:84%
One temple in
particular, the Torreon,

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.590 align:middle line:84%
reveals a strong
pre-diluvian signature,

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:90%
a celestial connection.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most important
structures at Machu Picchu is

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.640 align:middle line:90%
the Torreon.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a tower
that's actually

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.780 align:middle line:84%
built into the living
rock that would

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.640 align:middle line:84%
seem to have been of great
astronomical importance.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
In the center of it,
for instance, there

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:84%
is some kind of raised
rock feature, which

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:84%
would seem to indicate that
this location was important

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.800 align:middle line:84%
even before the building
of this monument,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
but it has a door, what's
known as the serpent door, that

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
would seem to look out
over the local landscape.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But then there are these two
windows, trapezoidal windows,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and this seemed to have
been very specifically

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:12.670 align:middle line:84%
placed so that you could
watch the Pleiades.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:10%
And the Pleiades
would seem to have

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:10%
been a crucially important
constellation in Incan

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:10%
and pre-Incan tradition.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:10%


00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Several sources connect two
ancient civilizations in South

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:10%
America with the Pleiades,
especially the star Maia.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Could the original builders of
the foundations at Machu Picchu

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.755 align:middle line:90%
have been from the star Maia?

00:16:38.755 --> 00:16:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> At Machu Picchu, there's
a particular temple called

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.650 align:middle line:90%
the Torreon.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
From above, it kind of looks
like a big shape of the letter

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
P. And it has a
window in it, which is

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.357 align:middle line:90%
aligned to the June solstice.

00:16:54.357 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Now in the Southern
hemisphere, that's

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.200 align:middle line:84%
the winter solstice based
around the 21st of June.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that's different
to the northern hemisphere.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:84%
What's also interesting
is that it also

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.990 align:middle line:84%
marks and frames the
movement of the Pleiades

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.390 align:middle line:84%
as well as it moves
through the sky,

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and specifically the star
Maia, the brightest star

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleiades is also
witnessed at this time of year.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:84%
During the winter solstice
sunrise in June in Peru,

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:84%
it lines up with a carved
grooved stone on the floor

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:90%
in the temple.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
part of the stone

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.920 align:middle line:84%
illuminates not long
after the time of sunrise.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And so you actually
get a marker stone,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
which directly illuminates
marking this time of year.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And also, it then
matches the movement

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Pleiades, which is
going on way distant behind it.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot going
on just in one temple here

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and it suggests that
most of the site,

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and all the other sites
in this part of the world,

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.500 align:middle line:84%
are aligning themselves
measuring very accurately

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:90%
the movement of the stars.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:10%
>> The Torreon is the most
important building at Machu

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:10%
Picchu.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the Torreon,
carved out of the cliff,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:13.070 align:middle line:84%
is a sacred space devoted
to the sun god, Inti.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Now Inti is a very
interesting character

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.980 align:middle line:84%
because he's portrayed as a
humanoid figure whose face is

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:90%
shimmering like the sun.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
He's considered a sun god.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And Inti has Pachamama
who, in some instances,

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:84%
is considered to be his
mother, as well as his consort.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
This is something
similar like to what

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
we see in Egypt with Isis,
Hathor, and her son Horus,

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.890 align:middle line:84%
or in the case of Hathor,
her companion Ra, the sun

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.850 align:middle line:84%
god, talking about a sun god and
a connection to a goddess who

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:90%
represents the Earth Mother.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is affirmed
with what happened

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:84%
after the Spanish
conquistadors came into Peru.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.190 align:middle line:84%
When they came in, they
converted the Incas

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:90%
to Catholicism, to Christianity.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Pachamama, the Earth
goddess, the Earth Mother

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
became aligned with the Virgin
Mary, the virgin mother.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And her son, of
course, is Jesus.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus now took on
the attributes of Inti.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So we see this very interesting
correspondence going from Egypt

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.470 align:middle line:84%
into Peru and now
with Christianity

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
being the new level or
iteration of this concept.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Another one of the keys
to the use of Machu Picchu is

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
the cosmological link between
specific portions of Machu

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Picchu and the stars,
the Andean night sky.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
The highest point
of Machu Picchu,

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
there is a monument that
is called the Intihuatana.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Intihuatana literally translates
into hitching post of the sun.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And it is believed that
this was a solar marker.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And even today on the equinox,
when the sun is directly

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
overhead, there
is no shadow cast

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and there are very
precise shadows

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
that are cast on the solstices,
the winter and the summer

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:84%
solstice in a way that
local people still use

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
and still recognize
to this time.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:10%
But the cosmology goes beyond
just looking at the sun

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:10%
because now it has been
recently recognized

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:10%
that there are portions of
Machu Picchu that are the Earth

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:10%
and mirror to the sky, to
cosmological constants,

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:10%
including the three stars
in the belt of Orion.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:10%
So just the way that we
see on the Giza Plateau

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.910 align:middle line:10%
the three pyramids line up
under the belt of Orion,

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.710 align:middle line:10%
it appears that
something very similar

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:10%
is happening in Peru under
the Andean night sky.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the connections between
the gods of Egypt and those

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Inca be a clue to
the identity of the ancient

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.060 align:middle line:90%
builders of Machu Picchu?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And if so, who could be
responsible for transmitting

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:84%
these traditions to different
cultures around the world?

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.280 align:middle line:84%
One example of these
legendary wise elders

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:90%
is the Inca deity Viracocha.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.860 align:middle line:84%
The tales from South
America speak of him

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
as a wise teacher in the
arts of civilization.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Viracocha literally
means a tilted plane,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.800 align:middle line:84%
almost like a tilted plane that
you find on a roof to make sure

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that the water
falls off the roof,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
which makes absolutely
no sense whatsoever,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:84%
until you realize that Viracocha
was a master astronomer.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:10%
Now an astronomer would
understand that term

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:10%
because the term
of a tilted plane

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.450 align:middle line:10%
literally is the plane of the
Earth relative to the plane

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.630 align:middle line:10%
that exists to define
the plane of the ecliptic

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.750 align:middle line:10%
in the universe.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's the Earth's
relationship to the level

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:84%
of the plane of the
sky, and that's made up

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.820 align:middle line:90%
of two different tilted planes.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So the name Viracocha
literally is a name of someone

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
who understands the
mechanics of the sky,

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and that makes a lot of
sense for an astronomer.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
part of the equation.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.080 align:middle line:84%
The next part is, who
were his seven helpers?

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Because whenever
civilization appears

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the
Earth after the flood,

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
they appears at the same time
around 8 and 1/2 1,000 BC

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and is always one
charismatic leader

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:84%
who leads seven crafts people,
experts in their field.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:10%
And in South America, they
are called the Hihiwapanti.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:10%
Now in Aymara, that
means the shining ones.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:10%
And at a stroke, you
just linked these people

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:10%
to the followers of Horus
in Egypt who are also

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.400 align:middle line:10%
called the shining ones.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And again, they're described
exactly as an Egyptian would.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So there are seven
people, one of whom

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.290 align:middle line:84%
is a woman who carries
the bloodline of the group

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and also happens to be the
wife of the charismatic leader.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.855 align:middle line:84%
So I wouldn't for
one moment suggest

00:22:47.855 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that they're the same group
of people that were in Egypt.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.733 align:middle line:84%
I'm suggesting that these
were the same groups that

00:22:53.733 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
appeared all around
the world that

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.220 align:middle line:84%
belong to the same
academy, following

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.260 align:middle line:90%
exactly the same prescription.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's what makes Viracocha
and his group so important

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:84%
because they
brought civilization

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:84%
to a part of the
world that had been

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:90%
decimated by a global flood.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
local traditions tell us

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
about this incredible
builder god.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the building of Machu
Picchu go back beyond ancient

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Egypt to possibly the time of
the Mu and Atlantean empires,

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
making the date of its
inception even earlier?

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:27.730 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a connection
between Egypt and Machu Picchu,

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.560 align:middle line:10%
but during the Atlantean
civilization, not before.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:84%
All the territory of the
Andes was being taken

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:90%
care of by the Mu civilization.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So all what was
close to the Pacific

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:90%
was a Mu construction before--

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.740 align:middle line:90%
way before Atlantis came.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
As we know today, Machu Picchu,
of course, was not like that.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:84%
It was totally different because
the construction was just

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:84%
the basis of stones,
like platforms,

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.800 align:middle line:90%
so people could go and receive.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:84%
The Mu civilization
built this basis around

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
to receive the people
from the skies,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
but also to teach to the people
from this Earth about all what

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:90%
the masters were bringing here.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Machu Picchu before any humans
took power on the territory

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:84%
was a school for humans to learn
about the art of manifestation.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It was a place between
the territory of the gods

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that were the mountains with
the territory of the people

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:90%
that were the rainforest.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So the people from
the rainforest

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.870 align:middle line:84%
would come to this school
and the people from the skies

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.330 align:middle line:84%
would come to that
school to teach them,

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and then they would
go back to the forest.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So it was a middle point
where everyone would connect.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And Atlantean civilization got
to control Central America.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:10%
And from there, going
through the Amazon

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.060 align:middle line:10%
and looking for the place
of manifestation that today

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:10%
would be Peru and Bolivia.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So through the Amazon River,
you reach the valleys of Cuzco,

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:84%
so you find the school, the
great school of manifestation.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So all this territory
once the Mu civilization

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:84%
fell down, disappeared, all
these people from Atlantis,

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:84%
they came to South America,
Central America, North America.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there was
a connection with Egypt

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:84%
historically, but also there
was another connection, which

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:90%
was related to the Old Equator.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:84%
The Old Equator was a
line that Atlanteans

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
were following in
order to access

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
the main movement of the
magnetic field of the planet.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:10%
In that moment, crossing
through Machu Picchu, Nazca,

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:10%
all the territory of Peru, going
straight through the Amazons,

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:10%
going through Mauritania,
Cambodia, through India,

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:10%
and then Egypt.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And so it would connect
that part of the South Peru

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:10%
with Egypt in a straight line.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:10%
They were using this Old Equator
to access the information that

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:10%
was flowing around the planet.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The age of Machu
Picchu truly is older,

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.370 align:middle line:84%
so much older than we've
been led to believe.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It's possible, because of
the continuity of knowledge

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
from civilization
to civilization,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that this could
be linked to some

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine principals of
much earlier times, including

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Lemuria, including Atlantis.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So as we begin to understand
these relationships,

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:84%
the mystery in the Machu
Picchu deepens because we still

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.900 align:middle line:84%
don't know where the people that
built Machu Picchu came from--

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
the technology was
never replicated again--

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
where they went when
they left, and what

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:84%
was the purpose of this
magnificent complex

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that they left as their
legacy for us today?

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.380 align:middle line:10%
>> As with most
pre-diluvian cultures,

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.800 align:middle line:10%
Orion and the Pleiades
play a predominant role

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.120 align:middle line:10%
in the legendary tales, but
what other celestial secrets may

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:10%
remain buried in this
majestic mountain?

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
As the mainstream
continues to find evidence

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:84%
that the lost city is older
than originally believed,

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:84%
it is hard to deny
that there are

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:84%
foundational connections
between this enigmatic site

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:90%
and cultures around the world.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Were there a group of wise
ones who helped humanity

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:90%
rebuild after the great flood?

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Were there several groups of
wise ones from the same school

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.730 align:middle line:90%
of initiation?

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:10%
And were they
responsible for guiding

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.760 align:middle line:10%
humanity back to these
sacred ceremonial sites

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.880 align:middle line:10%
to reconnect with the
ancient ways of living,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.180 align:middle line:10%
where connection between
the stars and our planet

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:10%
was like a tightrope?

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.120 align:middle line:10%
But as the connection frayed,
the heroes of humanity

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:10%
heard the call to go within,
to unite the heart and mind,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:10%
and help this planet be a
powerful and positive influence

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.560 align:middle line:10%
in our galaxy.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:90%
