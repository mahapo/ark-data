00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1905, physics genius
Nikola Tesla submitted his US

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:10%
patent 787,412, which was
titled "The Art of Transmitting

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Electrical Energy Through
the Natural Medium."

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
It included designs for a
series of worldwide generators.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Tesla realized
that the ionosphere

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
was sparkling with electrical
energy which could easily

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:90%
be tapped.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Planet Earth,
according to Tesla,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
was a gigantic
electrical generator,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
spinning around
two magnetic poles

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
from which limitless energy
can be harnessed using

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:90%
the right medium or shape.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:10%
His device was later
referred to as Tesla's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.160 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic pyramid
based on his design looking

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:10%
like a triangle shape.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Tesla tapping into the
actual shape of the pyramid,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:10%
I believe, was something that
just came round about through

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:10%
his investigation into the
location of the pyramids

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:10%
because what appears to have
happened is that he realized

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:10%
that it wasn't the actual
shape of the pyramid so much,

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:10%
although pyramids exhibit
fractal energy much more

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:10%
efficiently than other
types of designs.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.250 align:middle line:10%
But what he
discovered was it was

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:10%
the location of the pyramids
that created the power.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:10%
And when he built his facility
here in Colorado Springs

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:10%
and then on the East
Coast, he did so

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:10%
according to the laws of
where the pyramids of Giza

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:10%
were constructed.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with
the elliptical orbit

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and those
sites' relationship

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to the actual
equator, that there

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:84%
was a natural
construction somehow

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.840 align:middle line:84%
taking place between
those very specific sites

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and the overall energy
field of the Earth.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, he
believed he could transmit power

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.642 align:middle line:90%
wirelessly.

00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Tesla's discovery and
device disappeared after his

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:10%
mysterious death in 1943.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:10%
But what he was
trying to tap into

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:10%
might have just
scratched the surface

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.915 align:middle line:10%
of understanding the power of
something much more ancient.

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Nikola Tesla,
3-6-9 is a key to a universe.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.968 align:middle line:10%
Tesla became so
obsessed with this 3-6-9

00:02:54.968 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:10%
that he would drive
around a building

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:10%
three times before
going inside of it.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> He cleaned his
place with 18 napkins,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
lived in hotel rooms only
with a number divisible by 3.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
He made calculations
about things

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
in their immediate
environment just

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.620 align:middle line:84%
to make sure the result
was conceivable by three.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And he'd base his
choices on the results.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
He did everything
in sets of three.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:84%
What is Nikola Tesla trying
to make us understand?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We must understand that we
did not create mathematics.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
We discovered them.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
It is the universal
language and law.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:10%
No matter where in the
universe you are, 1 plus 2

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:10%
will always equal 3.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
universe obeys this law.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:90%
These forms are in nature.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.005 align:middle line:84%
But the ancients emulated
these forms in construction.

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> If Nikola Tesla's obsession
was with these numbers,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.620 align:middle line:84%
and his goal was to define his
location and time in space,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
could it be possible that
ancient humans created

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
monuments like the Great
Pyramids to remind us of these

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.040 align:middle line:90%
truths?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:10%
>> In Sumerian tradition
and in the surviving texts,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:10%
there is a very strong and
intriguing reference to what

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.860 align:middle line:10%
are called the seven
antediluvian sages,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:10%
the seven sages who
came before the flood.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:10%
And their leader is a
figure called Oannes.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:84%
We find that he is
depicted as a man.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But curiously, he
is wearing a sort

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.866 align:middle line:90%
of fish garb or a fish costume.

00:04:34.866 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists often refer to
him as a fish-garbed figure.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:10%
And the other seven
sages are also

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:10%
dressed in this fish costume.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:10%
So you see the legs of a
human being and the face

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:10%
and features of
bearded human being.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:10%
But then he's wearing, on
his head, the head of a fish.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.575 align:middle line:10%
And the body of a fish
hangs down his back.

00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a very curious
idea, really.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:10%
And he and all of them
hold in their hands

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:10%
a curious little bag, which I
tend to refer to as a man bag.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I see them as a kind of badge
of office, a recognizable symbol

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:84%
where perhaps members
of a brotherhood

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
would be able to recognize
one another by their carrying

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:90%
of this symbol.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
It was curious that we see a
figure holding the same bag

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that we see on the
Sumerian reliefs

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and holding it in
exactly the same way.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but those same

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:84%
bags turn up on top of pillar 43
in enclosure D at Gobekli Tepe,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
where we know that they're
at least 11,600 years old.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:10%
The tradition is clearly
rooted before the flood.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Then comes the flood.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The cataclysm wipes
everything out.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But that brotherhood
persists through the flood.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And after the flood,
they are again

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
offering the gifts of
civilization to mankind.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Could Oannes and his
sages have reemerged after

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
the cataclysmic flood to teach
the knowledge of the universe?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
In Sumerian cuneiforms,
Enki is sometimes depicted

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:84%
as a bearded man
wearing a fish costume

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.210 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes carrying a bag.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Interesting to note that in the
Egyptian depictions of gods,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
they are not holding a bag
but an important symbol called

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:90%
the ankh.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
The ankh depicts
immortality and life.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
It is also connected with
Isis and the planet Venus.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Could these carrying
devices be transmitting

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:90%
the same kind of energy?

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Anton Parks' research has
traced the reemergence of Enki

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
to Egypt and, as a
byproduct of his death,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.426 align:middle line:84%
the building of
the Great Pyramid.

00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:10%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.335 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.335 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>> In my view, the Great
Pyramid was built by Isis.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:10%
I believe it was created to
reincarnate Osiris into Horus.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:90%
It is quite complicated.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:84%
The Assyrian, the
so-called aquatic temple

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to Osiris in
Abydos, Abdju in Egyptian,

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.950 align:middle line:84%
means it is located
in the city which is,

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
according to Egyptian history,
the first city of Osiris.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.900 align:middle line:10%
Yet to be able to find
seashells on a temple located

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
the desert, you have

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:10%
to go back thousands of
years, at least 10,000 years.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:10%
Why would he have made such a
temple with aquatic features?

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:10%
Because Osiris,
who is also Enki--

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.340 align:middle line:10%
they are the same person--

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:10%
had amphibian genes.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, Enki, was
killed by his nemesis

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Set, who is, in fact,
Enlil, during one

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:90%
of their many battles.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It took place in Abydos,
which also corresponds

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:84%
to the Sumerian Abzu, where
Osiris's aquatic temple can

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:90%
be found.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
The texts clearly state that
all of Osiris's servants

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:84%
were slaughtered
during a battle,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:84%
as well as Osiris himself,
who was crucified on a tree.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:90%
This is how he died.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:10%
Isis is quite a character.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:10%
She can't really be found
in Mesopotamian literature,

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:10%
although she could be
considered the goddess Ninti.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
She is the woman who lives in
the great deeps underground.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that these
underground passageways

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
could correspond
to the ones we can

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.870 align:middle line:90%
find under the Giza Plateau.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Giza Plateau
is full of underground passages.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the clan
of Osiris lived there.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
As far as the resurrection of
Osiris into Horus is concerned,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:90%
Isis organizes it.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:84%
The texts are very
clear about that.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And we understand that she
used Osiris's genetic code

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.010 align:middle line:90%
to create Horus.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:84%
She created the Great Pyramid in
order to accomplish this task.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid allowed Isis
to find Osiris's soul again.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:90%
We don't really know how.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:84%
But she would have put Horus's
genetic code in the pyramid.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:10%
She would have been able to
create another body using

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:10%
Osiris's genetic code, the
so-called Yuef in Egyptian,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.790 align:middle line:10%
body.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to the coding
of the Great Pyramid,

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
she reached Osiris's
soul so it could come

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:90%
into the new body of Horus.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the dating of the
Great Pyramid has been argued

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.180 align:middle line:84%
by different scientists,
there is evidence that below

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:84%
the monument something existed
there that was much older.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.490 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at the Great
Pyramid, the second pyramid,

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.260 align:middle line:10%
third pyramid, there's no doubt
in my mind that they were being

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:10%
reused, should we say,
partially reconstructed,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.310 align:middle line:10%
built upon during
Dynastic times,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:10%
just like the Sphinx itself was
being repaired during Dynastic

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:10%
times.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:10%
But I'm also convinced
that at least the core

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.260 align:middle line:10%
of those pyramids,
particularly the Great Pyramid

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:10%
and the second pyramid, go
back to a much earlier period.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
the Great Pyramid

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is actually built on what I
would call a sacred mound.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:10%
And this is acknowledged
even by the Egyptologists.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:10%
Now, they say it all goes back
to the Fourth Dynasty, circa

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:10%
2600, 2500 BC.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
But my analysis is
that at least the core,

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:84%
the original portions, for
instance the descending

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
passage, the
subterranean chamber,

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
go back to a much
earlier period.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Then it was built over.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think some of
that building over it

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.050 align:middle line:84%
goes back to prior
to Dynastic times.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this be proof
of the Clan of Osiris

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and their knowledge?

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And could this
group have harnessed

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:84%
the powers of the universe
to bring back a god?

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Some experts point to
the fact that the Great

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid itself has always been
connected with the afterlife.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What you'll find inside those
pyramids is acres, and acres,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and acres of texts, deeply
inscribed into the walls.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:10%
They belong to the same
vast body of literature

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:10%
to which belongs the famous
ancient Egyptian Book

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:10%
of the Dead.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:10%
And the ultimate moment in
your journey through the Duat

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.558 align:middle line:10%
is your entry into the
Judgment Hall of Osiris,

00:11:14.558 --> 00:11:16.100 align:middle line:10%
the Hall of Ma'at,
and where you will

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.070 align:middle line:10%
be asked to account for
everything that you've

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:10%
done with your life.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to me, very
clear, that the Great Pyramid

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
is part of an attempt to create
a three-dimensional model

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:90%
of the afterlife realm.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> If the ancient text from
both Sumerian cuneiforms

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and Egyptian books suggest
the Great Pyramid as a place

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:84%
to resurrect the dead, could
there be another hidden

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.356 align:middle line:90%
message?

00:11:45.356 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an ancient code
to be found within the Great

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's within the geometry
not just of the pyramid

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
itself but its relationship
to the other two main pyramids

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:90%
of the Giza Plateau.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:10%
Having studied this
for a number of years,

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.290 align:middle line:10%
it seems to be related
very much to do

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:10%
with the idea of the
music of the spheres,

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.700 align:middle line:10%
the idea that there is
some kind of connection

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.260 align:middle line:10%
between the primal tones
of the universe itself

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:10%
and their relationship to the
creation of form and structure

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:10%
in the physical world, and that
to somehow attune and enhance

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:10%
this connection, that
certain proportions have

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.060 align:middle line:10%
to be constructed into
the design of the pyramid

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:10%
and also the geometry
of the landscape itself.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And these seem to reflect
the musical intervals,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.040 align:middle line:84%
in particular those
which are known

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
as the perfect fourth,
which has a ratio of 4:3,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and those known as the perfect
fifth, as a ratio of 3 to 2,

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.296 align:middle line:84%
one of which is an
inverse form of the other.

00:13:06.296 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Great Pyramid
is indeed a construction

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize creation, wherein
lies the code to such a great

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.786 align:middle line:90%
power?

00:13:15.786 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Many people don't
know this, but, in fact,

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.160 align:middle line:10%
it's not a four-sided pyramid.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.620 align:middle line:10%
It has a slight
concavity on each side,

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.030 align:middle line:10%
making it an
eight-sided pyramid.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, the minute you do this, you
not only complicate the design

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:84%
tremendously, but it produces
another bizarre geometry.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So this geometry, when we
analyze it, produces numbers.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Numbers keep
popping out, numbers

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
that shouldn't be there,
things like universal constant.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.470 align:middle line:84%
That has been known for
over 100 years, the phi

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:90%
constant, the golden ratio.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:10%
But we have now strange numbers,
like Euler's number, coming up

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.465 align:middle line:10%
in the design.

00:13:58.465 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Could this geometry
produce a message?

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:10%
>> The Great Pyramid is situated
within a whisker of latitude

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:10%
30.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the
latitude choice

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:84%
was derived from
astronomy because there's

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
a lens effect of the
atmosphere of the Earth.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you take
that into account,

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the tiny error shy of
latitude 30 goes away.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:84%
They were on astronomical
latitude 30, if you like,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
seems like a very
deliberate choice

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
a random latitude.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.330 align:middle line:84%
It's 1/3 of the way between
the equator and the North Pole.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
This is just one of
the many ways, I feel,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:84%
in which the Great Pyramid
deliberately and purposefully

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:90%
speaks to our planet.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
The next way it does that is
that it is a line that if you

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
take upon yourself the
project of building a pyramid

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and aligning it to true north,
south, east, and west, you

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.620 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't make any error at all.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:84%
There is an error in
the Great Pyramid.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It's tiny.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
It's 3/60 of a single
degree off true north.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle line:84%
This is almost eerie
precision because of the scale

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:90%
of the monument is so huge.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.900 align:middle line:90%
This thing is 481 feet high.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It has a footprint of 13,
slightly more than 13 acres.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:90%
It weighs 6 million tons.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It consists of 2 and 1/2 million
individual blocks of stone.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.130 align:middle line:84%
You're taking that whole
gigantic mountain of stone,

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.015 align:middle line:84%
and you are aligning
it within just 3/60

00:15:34.015 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
of a single degree
of true north.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
magnetic north, which varies.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
astronomical north,

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:90%
the true north of this planet.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a very remarkable
thing, and that's

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.830 align:middle line:90%
the north of this planet.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Once again, the Great Pyramid
is speaking to the Earth.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the pyramid be
revealing something else about

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:10%
our planet?

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you find something
else as you go deeper.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Start measuring
the Great Pyramid.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Measure it very,
very, very precisely.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Measure its base perimeter.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:90%
And then measure its height.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:90%
And scale those numbers up.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
What you find is that at
a scale of 1 to 43,200--

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'll explain why that's
not a random scale in a moment.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:84%
On a scale of 1 to 43,200,
the dimensions of the pyramid

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:84%
give you the dimensions
of this planet.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
measure the base perimeter

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid, and
multiply it by 43,200,

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.955 align:middle line:84%
you get the equatorial
circumference of the Earth.

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you measure the
height of the Great Pyramid,

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and multiply it by 43,200,
you get the polar radius

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:10%
So in all those centuries
and millennia, when

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:10%
our ancestors went
through the Dark Ages,

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:10%
and didn't even know that they
were living on a planet, let

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:10%
alone the dimensions of the
planet, all they ever had to do

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.020 align:middle line:10%
was go accurately measure
the Great Pyramid,

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:10%
multiply those
numbers by 43,200,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:08.008 align:middle line:10%
and they have the
dimensions of our planet.

00:17:08.008 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this be the evidence
to suggest that ancient places,

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
like the Great Pyramid, are
here to always show us our place

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.951 align:middle line:90%
in the stars?

00:17:17.951 --> 00:17:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Egyptologists
are aware of this.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But they say it's a
total coincidence.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:84%
There's no significance
to it whatsoever

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.394 align:middle line:84%
as far as Egyptologists
are concerned.

00:17:27.394 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And if the scale were
something different,

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:84%
if it were 1 to 57,000
or 1 to 42,000 even,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:90%
they could be right.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
The reason they're not right is
that the scale is not random.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
The scale is defined by a key
motion of the Earth itself.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth, as well as
spinning on its own axis,

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:90%
has a wobble on its axis.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
That's called precession,
rather the effect

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.822 align:middle line:84%
that you get if you set
a spinning top spinning.

00:18:00.822 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:84%
As it begins to slow
down, it begins to wobble.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And the top of the top begins
to transcribe a circle.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:90%
The Earth does that.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
If you take the extended
north pole of the Earth,

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and extend it out
into the heavens,

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that today
in our time it's pointing

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:90%
at a star we call Polaris.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:90%
That's our Pole Star.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But it hasn't always
pointed at Polaris.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And it won't always point
at Polaris in the future.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it'll
point at empty space.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it pointed and
will point at other stars.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.392 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when Thuban
in Draco was the Pole Star.

00:18:35.392 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:84%
That's because of the
precessional wobble

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:90%
on the Earth's axis.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.873 align:middle line:84%
The extended north
pole of the Earth

00:18:39.873 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
isn't always pointing
at the same place.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Over a cycle of 25,920
years, it's doing that.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.100 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
Pole Star changes.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.735 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
on the horizon--

00:18:52.735 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and we know that
ancient cultures

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:84%
had a great interest in
particular moments of the year,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.600 align:middle line:84%
particularly the equinoxes,
when night and day are

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:90%
of equal length.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
It was an obsession
of ancient cultures.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
What was the constellation that
lay in the place on the horizon

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.710 align:middle line:84%
where the sun rose on
the spring equinox?

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:84%
What was the constellation
that housed the sun?

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:84%
This is familiar
language in astrology.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:84%
What's the constellation
that housed

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:90%
the sun on the spring equinox?

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
In our epoch, it's the
constellation of Pisces.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
We live in the Age of
Pisces, near the end of it

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not an accident that the
early Christians used the fish

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
as their symbol
because Christianity

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
began at very near the
beginning of the age of Pisces.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:10%
Each one of these zodiacal
ages lasts for 2,160 years.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And then the sun transits out
of-- on the equinox, transits

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:10%
out of one constellation
and into another.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:10%
So we Indeed do live in the
dawning of the Age of Aquarius.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Because of the precessional
motion of the Earth,

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:84%
because of this change, this
wobble on the Earth's axis,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.420 align:middle line:84%
the constellation that
houses the sun on the equinox

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
is shifting out of
Pisces and into Aquarius.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:84%
That shift will be complete
within the next 100 or 150

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
What we have here
is a process that

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:84%
operates at the rate of
1 degree every 72 years.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:84%
We allocate 30 degrees
to each of the 12

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:90%
constellations of the zodiac.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Multiply 72 by 30,
and you get 2,160.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:90%
That's a zodiacal age.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Take the whole cycle of
the zodiac, the whole 12

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
constellations, each
with 2,160 years

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.820 align:middle line:84%
housing the sun on
the spring equinox,

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and you get what the ancients
called the Great Year

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:84%
when everything cycles
back to the beginning.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And the whole process
starts again, do you follow?

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:90%
That's 25,920 years.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The heartbeat is 1
degree every 72 years.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:84%
It is defined by a key
motion of our planet.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:59.430 align:middle line:84%
That number, 43,200,
is a multiple of 72.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.795 align:middle line:84%
It's directly related
to that number.

00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's not as
though we're confined

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.500 align:middle line:90%
to Giza and the Great Pyramid.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Those numbers are found
all over the world.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.090 align:middle line:84%
They're found in
ancient mythology.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, after all, was killed
by Set and his 72 conspirators.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The number occurs in the
ancient Egyptian texts.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.200 align:middle line:84%
It occurs in the
number of syllables

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:90%
in the Rigveda in India.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.090 align:middle line:90%
It occurs in Norse mythology.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It's found all around the world.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
There's an intense focus
on this system of numbers.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So it can't be an accident
that the same system of numbers

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.310 align:middle line:84%
crops up in the Great Pyramid,
and that not only does

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid give us
the dimensions of the Earth,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:84%
but that it does so on a scale
defined by the Earth itself.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.330 align:middle line:84%
That's an incredibly
clever piece of work

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:90%
that we're looking at there.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the ancient builders
have given us a monument

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:90%
to decode our human existence?

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly enough,
the numbers Tesla

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.780 align:middle line:10%
was obsessed with show up in the
equations of the Great Pyramid.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:10%
The numbers Graham has
concluded from his research

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:10%
on the pyramid are 72, 43,200,
600, 30, 25,920, and 2,160.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:10%
And all of those numbers
either equal 3, 6, or 9.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Then let's give
you one more example.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Let's track east from Giza.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's go off to
Cambodia, to Angkor

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
in Cambodia, an
amazing sight, again,

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
very much devoted
to the investigation

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.350 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery of death.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
The very word
Angkor actually has

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
a meaning in the ancient
Egyptian language.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It means life to the Horus.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, it
turns out that Angkor,

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
with its pyramidal
monuments, Angkor

00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:84%
lies exactly 72 degrees
of longitude east of Giza.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.712 align:middle line:84%
I do not believe that that is
a accident or a coincidence.

00:23:04.712 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I think there is a deep
and ancient connection.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.212 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
looking at in Angkor--

00:23:08.212 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
because that site
was continuously

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:84%
used by many later cultures,
both Hindu and Buddhist--

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
what we're looking at in Angkor
is the latest incarnation

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:84%
of a much more ancient site
which, just like Giza, goes

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.311 align:middle line:90%
back into remote prehistory.

00:23:23.311 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these precise
calculations be spread across

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:84%
the globe and
communicating a code?

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible this is what
Nikola Tesla tapped into?

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.486 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bauval predicts this
is the language of the future.

00:23:38.486 --> 00:23:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the way we read
the universe is through

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:43.662 align:middle line:84%
mathematics, and
through its geometry,

00:23:43.662 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and through its
mathematics and geometry.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.930 align:middle line:90%
We need to know.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, through
our evolution, we

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
begin to work out how triangles
work, circles, ellipses,

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:84%
various shapes, and now,
work out the numbers, how

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.670 align:middle line:90%
they produce numbers.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.770 align:middle line:84%
So having said
this, the language

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that we, as human beings,
will be communicating,

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:90%
sounds a bit--

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
it sounds a bit too
science fiction.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think we'll be
talking English or Chinese

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.855 align:middle line:90%
in the next 2, 3 centuries.

00:24:13.855 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Already, we're using a different
language, using computers.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll be talking
mathematics in the sense that

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.240 align:middle line:84%
to get a pure idea out,
to get a pure thought out,

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and to structure it so that
you understand exactly what

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about-- the shape,
the size, the dimension,

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:90%
the weight, the speed--

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to number it.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to put mathematics.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is
speaking that language.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:90%
It's transmitting that language.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a silent language, if you
like, that needs to be read.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.250 align:middle line:90%
We don't need Egyptologists.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't need experts
in hieroglyphs.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have hieroglyphs.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:90%
We need mathematicians.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.200 align:middle line:84%
We need mathematicians
to read it.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the goals is
to tempt them to get into this.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:03.250 align:middle line:84%
We've moved in a direction where
we rely on external knowledge.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:05.785 align:middle line:84%
We seem to think that
the answer is out there.

00:25:05.785 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And we look for it.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
may be inside us.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:90%
I fully believe this.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we need to
rechange how we see ourselves

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:90%
and how we educate ourselves.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I think what's interesting
now is that the science is

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.290 align:middle line:84%
beginning to sort of touch
the frontiers of what

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.890 align:middle line:84%
you would call, in general
terms, spirituality.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.620 align:middle line:84%
We begin to realize that
the universe is mental.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:90%
It is a mental universe.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And we need to think in
different forms, not just

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.050 align:middle line:90%
purely classical science.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>> If, indeed, the purpose
of the Great Pyramid was

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.760 align:middle line:84%
to educate humans on our
place in time and space,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.120 align:middle line:84%
could it also be a device to
help change our consciousness?

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I have, for a long while,
argued that the central concept

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:84%
of, certainly, the
pyramids of Egypt--

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.130 align:middle line:84%
and I think the case is
true all over the world--

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
was to do with
the transformation

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Whatever else the Great Pyramid
is, the Great Pyramid of Giza

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, whatever
else it is, it

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.551 align:middle line:84%
is, for sure, an instrument that
works upon human consciousness.

00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Great Pyramid
be a monument that was built

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:27.210 align:middle line:84%
to withstand all catastrophes so
that humanity could always have

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:90%
the codes to the universe?

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Standing near the pyramid
is another monument that

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.792 align:middle line:90%
has baffled experts for ages.

00:26:35.792 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 1990s, when I first
started studying the Sphinx,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
what I determined is that
it must go back to a earlier

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.720 align:middle line:90%
climatic period.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.540 align:middle line:84%
When I initially
calibrate these,

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:84%
I knew that it had to be
at least 5,000 to 7,000 BC.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Since then I've
continued my studies,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm convinced at this
point that we have to go back

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.000 align:middle line:90%
to at least around 10,000 BC.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next, the code left
behind by the Sphinx.
