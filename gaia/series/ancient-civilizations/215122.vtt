00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Giza, of all the mysteries
along the Western banks

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:84%
of the Nile, there is little
doubt that this plateau contains

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:84%
the biggest unsolved mystery in
the entire Memphite Necropolis.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.800 align:middle line:84%
The grandiosity and precision
of the Great Pyramid

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:84%
provides a glimpse into
a pre-diluvian world,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
where sophisticated architecture
and engineering defied

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:84%
the laws of physics and set
a benchmark for technology

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that our modern world
has yet to achieve.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Debates around the exact
date of construction

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:84%
for this megalithic wonder have
been igniting for thousands

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:84%
of years, but new
scanning technology

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.000 align:middle line:84%
has inspired
alternative researchers

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.660 align:middle line:84%
to look deeper into the chambers
of this astounding structure,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to piece together a
multi-dimensional understanding

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.970 align:middle line:84%
of the power and purpose of the
greatest pyramid on the planet.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Today, we have
scientists, mathematicians,

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:10%
engineers looking at the
pyramid complex of Giza,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.970 align:middle line:10%
looking at other
assorted pyramids.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:10%
Some view them as power
plants that somehow

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Egyptians were
harvesting this power for we're

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.760 align:middle line:10%
not sure what devices.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:10%
We know they weren't
using iPhones and razors.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:10%
So what would the Giza
power plant have been for?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we come
back to their words themselves

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that they said the Great Pyramid
was an instrument of ascension.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:90%
They called it maier.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
It was an energetic apparatus
for transfiguring humans

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.250 align:middle line:84%
into plasma beings so that they
could then travel the stars.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>> When you go to Egypt,
especially around the Giza

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Plateau, there's a stream of
wisdom that goes back through

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.660 align:middle line:84%
time, and it's still
very palpable there.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:10%
One idea that is often
thought of or presented

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:10%
within the construction of the
various temples, this network

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:10%
of temples and pyramids
and so forth within Egypt,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:10%
as the initiate would travel
from one temple to another

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:10%
and spend a certain amount of
time within that environment.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
They would be entrained into
the energy of that environment,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and that entrainment would
help unlock certain frequencies

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
within them that would then
start an alchemical process,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.960 align:middle line:84%
slowly working one's way up,
up the chain, up the spine,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:90%
up the chakra system.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So it was a long process, but
that's how it should be done.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Through enough time
and preparation,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:90%
they would become ready.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
They would be prepared for
their final initiatory processes

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.700 align:middle line:90%
at the higher levels.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Now all the pyramids around
Giza and all the area north

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:10%
and south of it are fascinating
for several reasons, one,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:10%
because you've got buildings
which are so completely over

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:10%
the top, you wonder why.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Were they trying to be beacons
because they were needed

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:84%
to be located after, let's say,
a flood overwhelms the region

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and the survivors
come back, and they

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
have to locate something
like in a storeroom?

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But then again, you look at the
type and the choice of stone

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.930 align:middle line:90%
that they use.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a lot
of granite, and you

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of limestone,
two types of limestone.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And you figured, well,
these things have two

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:90%
different energetic qualities.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
One's a very positive,
electric charge.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:84%
The other one's a very
negative electric charge.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And together, they form
this kind of battery.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would that be necessary
in buildings that would

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.880 align:middle line:90%
have been used as storerooms?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first
question we go and ask.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Why energy?

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
If the buildings were
used as energy devices,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
we have some science
to back this up.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:10%
Because when you actually
look at the energy

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:10%
outside of these pyramids and
you measure the local background

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:10%
and you measure the energy
frequency inside the buildings,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:10%
something's changed.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The energy inside the
buildings is very different.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
frequency seems to be

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
one that drives you or
at least your brainwaves

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
to go from a state of
thinking to one of feeling.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It puts you into
a receptive state.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to me that there
are multiple levels of function

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:90%
for these buildings.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The pyramid texts are
texts that were discovered

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:90%
at the pyramid of Unas.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
A small pyramid right next to
the step pyramid at Saqqara.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:10%
And they tell the story of why
the human body was augmented.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:10%
It was so that the pharaoh could
ascend the stairway to heaven.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have utterances
in the pyramid texts

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that say the pharaoh
became like lightning.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Lightning is plasma.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the sun.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:10%
This is why they're called
the sons of the sun.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
They're entering into
this plasma state

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:84%
where then they could
travel, perhaps,

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.030 align:middle line:84%
through the sun to
other star systems.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is the fundamental
basis for everything

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that we see on the Giza Plateau,
on the West Bank of the Nile,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
around Cairo, in
the pyramid fields.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
All of the answers for what
those structures are answered

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
in the pyramid texts, and
they make it abundantly clear

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that conduits and temples
of transformation, they

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
all tell the same story that
humans can become like the gods.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
We can join the gods
in the star fields.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:10%
>> As the debate continues
around the power and purpose

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids throughout
the Memphite Necropolis.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:10%
The evidence is mounting that
the architects and masons

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.970 align:middle line:10%
of these sacred monuments
encrypted knowledge

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.230 align:middle line:10%
within them designed to
stand the test of time.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.230 align:middle line:84%
A deeper look into the
chambers of the Great Pyramid

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
reveals sonic secrets
of transformation.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So we go back to the Orion
connection with the Giza

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Plateau, and we
focus, specifically,

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.725 align:middle line:90%
on the King's Chamber now.

00:06:16.725 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Look at the position of
the King's Chamber relative

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:90%
to the pyramid.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly 1/3 to
2/3 in the position.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a very dynamic
position, which

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
physicists to be a kind of
tension point in energy.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's say if NASA Is trying
to send a probe out into deep

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:84%
space way beyond
the solar system,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:84%
it knows that there's a fulcrum
2/3 along the solar system where

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
something happens, where there's
this gravitational anomaly that

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
shoots the probe way
past the solar system,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:90%
and it just keeps on going.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians were aware
of this kind of tension

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:90%
in terms of energy.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the one
chamber where everybody

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.080 align:middle line:84%
has incredible
experiences is to do

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
with the positioning
geometrically

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.760 align:middle line:90%
of the chamber within that era.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe the Great Pyramid
is a spiritual ascension

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:10%
stargate.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:10%
The stargate can be found
inside the King's Chamber.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:84%
This is an initiatory path
that, after walking up

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
the grand gallery,
letting go and shedding

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:84%
all of the emotional trauma that
we've taken into our lifetimes

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:84%
to be ready for this path
as we enter into the King's

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Chamber, on bended
knee, in a sanctuary

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that is sacred, a place
of sound frequency.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Its composition is over
70% quartz crystal,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
the resonance of which is so
powerful we do not yet fully

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.580 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.390 align:middle line:84%
While we use quartz crystal for
many things like in computer

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:84%
chips, we do not yet fully
understand the relationship

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
that occurs when sound travels
faster than the speed of sound

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:90%
through ambient air.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:10%
The speed of sound through
ambient air is 343,

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:10%
and yet through granite it jumps
up to 6,000 meters per second.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The chambers themselves are
constructed in a way where they

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:90%
become resonant cavities.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the sarcophagus,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
which contains the Rose
granite, and there's

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
a lot of quartz within the
construct of the whole pyramid

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And so with this combination
of harnessing sound technology

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
by creating resonant chambers,
the acoustics within it

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:90%
is incredible.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the Rose
granite and the quartz,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.510 align:middle line:84%
which then is harnessing
the Earth's energies

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and amplifying our
energy as well.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Our own biofield gets
amplified within that space.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:84%
So the combination of
all of it will very much

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:90%
create an altered state.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
It can stimulate
the pineal gland.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
It can stimulate
the hypothalamus.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
It can stimulate all
the different parts

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
of the endocrine system, the
chakras, the energy field.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, all of these
things, get stimulated

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:84%
and establish a very harmonic
state within our being.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Because of the harmonic
frequencies and sacred geometry

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and everything that goes
into the construction

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
of these chambers, that
it is a technology,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
an ancient technology for
creating altered states

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2019, I was lucky enough
to be involved with a study

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid
with recording equipment.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:84%
We found that in
each of the chambers

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of low
frequency activity,

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and this low frequency
activity went right

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:52.490 align:middle line:84%
the way down into the infrasound
range that's below 20 hertz.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
This has an effect upon
both the body and the mind,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:84%
bringing about a sense
of otherworldliness.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Inside the King's
chamber, you have

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that were perfectly
aligned with the human voice.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you were able
to talk, to chant, to intone,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:84%
the walls would quite literally
vibrate to your presence.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was reflected
also in the sarcophagus,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that if you went inside
this, and you intoned

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:84%
that the resonance
frequencies of the sarcophagus

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
would resonate with
your voice, or let's

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:84%
say, somebody that was intoning
above you at that point.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And this has a way of
affecting human consciousness.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:84%
You have this sense
that the sound is

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
being carried on
forever and that there

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:90%
are no longer any walls.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very typical
effect of very low frequency

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
or infrasound activity, that
it affects you in such a way

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
that it's almost like
a portal opens up

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:90%
between this world and the next.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>> As we look more
deeply at this structure,

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:84%
we cannot help but ask
ourselves the question,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
what would be necessary in order
to access this stargate if it,

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:90%
in fact, is a stargate.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Do we have any evidence that
the sarcophagus was actually

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the room?

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
We know that historically it's
been moved on several occasions.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:84%
We know that the current
location is not the location

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:90%
that it was.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.230 align:middle line:84%
We were able to find the
chip marks in the floor

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.230 align:middle line:84%
where the granite
floor was chipped

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to lift underneath
the sarcophagus

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%
and move it to where
its current location is.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.652 align:middle line:84%
When we place the constellation
of Orion over the King's

00:11:56.652 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
chamber, it shows us exactly
that the sarcophagus, precisely

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
at the center of the room, would
frame the three belt stars.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:84%
The number of times the
sarcophagus fits in the King's

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Chamber is six times
to the ceiling,

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and five times wall to
wall, from the north wall

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:90%
to the southern wall.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And for a total of
137 times, we see

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:84%
the volume matching perfectly,
the fine structure constant,

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.060 align:middle line:84%
the veritable
separation of light

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.700 align:middle line:84%
from darkness in what is
known as the electron coupling

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:90%
constant in physics.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> The evidence is mounting that
the Great Pyramid was built like

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
a supremely advanced
technological machine.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But the question remains was it
built for spiritual initiation,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:90%
free energy, or both.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:10%
>> There are places where
science, spirituality,

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:10%
ancient history, and mystery
come together in a really

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:10%
beautiful way.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the most profound
of those places, the King's

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Chamber, the Great
Pyramid of Giza.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at the
chamber as an isolated

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:84%
room with no context,
it's very difficult

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.260 align:middle line:90%
to get a handle on the mystery.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have
asked the question,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
is the sarcophagus in
its original position,

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
or was it located more in
the center of the chamber

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:90%
at an earlier period in time.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the north wall

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:84%
at the foot of the
sarcophagus, what

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
you see if you look
closely, is that there

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:84%
is a block in that wall that
is a non-load bearing block.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
What that means is if you were
to remove that block, in no way

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
would it impact the
ability of the blocks

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
above to remain
in place, creating

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
an opening that is precisely the
size of the sarcophagus itself.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.270 align:middle line:84%
If this were the
case, this would

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
be the place where
that sarcophagus would

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.040 align:middle line:84%
move into the King's
Chamber and out

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:84%
of the King's Chamber
at very specific times,

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:90%
for very specific reasons.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:90%
The question is why.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Why would the sarcophagus
be at that place?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Why would they want
to move it in and out?

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:10%
>> In dowsing in terms you have
what's called remnants dowsing

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.660 align:middle line:10%
and that could take a stone
away from Stonehenge or Avebury

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:10%
or wherever, and you can
dowse its original placement.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And the dowsing rod would
detect exactly where

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
something has previously
stood and has been moved.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And I use that
geomantic technique

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.050 align:middle line:84%
to check for the location
of the sarcophagus

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
within the King's Chamber, and
it's not in the right place.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
This is an ascension
machine, a place

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:44.620 align:middle line:84%
to transform the physical
body into something etheric,

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:90%
something metaphysical.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And quite clearly,
this is there for us

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to use as well for
initiation purposes

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to quite literally allow
our minds to be expanded

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and to connect with that which
exists outside of the norm.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for this would
be not only the attainment

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.910 align:middle line:84%
of otherworldly
knowledge and wisdom

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
but also some kind
of open connection

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
with what I call the
entanglement of all,

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the idea that all particles
can not only be connected

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
but that can possibly even
be in two places at once.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Whether they are here and in
the other side of the universe,

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.580 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:90%
There is no limit on distance.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
on a quantum level,

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:84%
it's outside of
normal space time.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what you can use

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that sarcophagus inside
the King's Chamber

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:90%
for, even to this day.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
From DaVinci and Napoleon
to Tesla and Newton,

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.220 align:middle line:84%
the lives that have been
changed after entering

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
this legendary pyramid
leave little doubt

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:84%
around the monument's
transformative power.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:90%
But what about free energy?

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.620 align:middle line:84%
Was one of the most
famous biblical

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:90%
relics a key to this machine?

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
What we know from
the historic texts

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:84%
is that the inner dimensions of
the sarcophagus in the King's

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Chamber are precisely the
dimensions of the biblical Ark

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.780 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the Covenant
is very well-documented

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:84%
in historic and religious texts,
and scientists pretty much

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
agree that if we were to build
an Ark of the Covenant today

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
based upon the instructions,
based upon the materials,

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%
based upon the
dimensions that were

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.670 align:middle line:84%
left to us in the biblical
text, for example,

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of
Exodus, that that Ark

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:90%
would function as a capacitor.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:84%
A capacitor,
typically, it is made

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.450 align:middle line:84%
of two plates of
conductive material

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:84%
with a nonconductor
in the middle.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.359 align:middle line:84%
The biblical Ark of the
Covenant, the plates

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
were gold, highly conductive,
and the wood in between

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
was acacia wood,
very specifically

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
noted in the biblical texts.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So this device of the
Ark of the Covenant

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:90%
functioned as a capacitor.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It could have functioned
for other things as well.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
That capacitor fit
precisely inside

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.740 align:middle line:84%
of the sarcophagus in
the King's Chamber.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:84%
That capacitor is a switch
that can begin and end

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:90%
a sequence of events.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
When that switch is outside
of the chamber, as would

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:84%
be possible moving the
sarcophagus through the block

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
the door on the north side,
that chamber is stable.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:84%
When the King's Chamber is
enacted, when it is enabled,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and when the sarcophagus
with the Ark of the Covenant

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
is placed inside of the chamber,
the capacitor begins to charge.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And the way a
capacitor works is it

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:84%
will accumulate energy
until it reaches

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
the voltage it was
designed to accommodate,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and then it will release that
energy and begin charging again

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and release that energy
and begin charging again.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And in this way,
it is a perpetual--

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:90%
a self-perpetuating device.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Where's the energy coming from
that is charging that capacitor?

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where it
gets even more interesting.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.330 align:middle line:90%
It is a high quartz granite.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
84.6% of that granite
is made of quartz.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
any kind of quartz,

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:90%
it is a piezoelectric quartz.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And what this means is that
when pressure was applied

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
to that quartz, it emits
an electrical charge

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:84%
as one granite, is low level
radiation, both uranium

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:90%
and thorium.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:10%
And these are important elements
in the kind of reaction that

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about because
the radiation actually creates

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:10%
a greater resistance
-it's called impedance-

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:10%
that stabilizes the system as it
is charging and releasing energy

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:26.010 align:middle line:10%
so that the system cannot
get out of control.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid itself,
the sheer mass

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramid sitting
on the Giza Plateau

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
also creates what scientists
call the mass battery effect.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.280 align:middle line:84%
It is the sheer volume of the
Earth, the mass of the Earth,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and the potential,
the negative potential

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%
of the ground, the positive
potential in the atmosphere that

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:84%
are also creating an
electrical charge.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So now we're looking
at a massive device

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that is being charged and
that charge is then being

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:90%
released, charged and released.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And we ask, what
would be the purpose.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Why would something
like this be built?

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where
the hieroglyphic texts

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:84%
become really interesting
because those texts describe

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:90%
a process.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:84%
From an engineering perspective
we would call this a portal.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.390 align:middle line:84%
When the energy
from that capacitor

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:84%
reaches what is called
sympathetic vibratory

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
frequency with a pre-existing
domain, another dimension,

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
in theory, that
would open a portal.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It would open a conduit
between that room

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and that domain
or that dimension.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, the King's
Chamber and the sarcophagus

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and the Ark and the
pyramid work together

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to create this portal, this
doorway to other worlds,

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to other dimensions.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:90%
This is for the device itself.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
What if the Ark of the Covenant
is not in that sarcophagus?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
What if a human body
is in that sarcophagus?

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And one of the little known
facts about the Great Pyramid is

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:84%
when researchers began going in
late in the 1800s, early 1900s,

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:84%
in that sarcophagus, they
found a kind of dust.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:84%
In the sarcophagus, they
didn't know what it was,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:84%
but they collected it, and
they collected it and held it

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
until the mid-20th century,
when our technology,

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
our spectroscopy, and
our chemical analysis

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:84%
could determine what
this dust was made of.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And no one expected the answer
because it was a form of calcium

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
that we find in the pineal
gland of the human brain.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
was left in this

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
sarcophagus was the calcium
of human pineal glands.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Where was the body that these
glands were attached to?

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
mystical traditions

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:84%
of the past and the
technology of present day

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
come together in, perhaps,
an unexpected way.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Just the way that the
Ark of the Covenant

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.950 align:middle line:84%
provided capacitance
to start this system

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
as a device, the human
body, the 50 trillion cells

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
of the human body
are now documented

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
to have properties,
electrical properties.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Every cell is a transistor.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:90%
Every cell is a resistor.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Every cell is a capacitor.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Each cell generates about 0.07
volts of electrical potential.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And do the math 50 trillion
cells approximately

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
times 0.07 volts, and we're
talking about 3.5 trillion volts

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:84%
of electrical potential
inside of the human body.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of
the piezo field,

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:84%
in the presence
of the radiation,

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:90%
a portal is also created.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
The portal is
through the pineal,

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and the body actually
moves through the portal

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.100 align:middle line:90%
of the pineal.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:84%
And all that's left is
the portal of the pineal.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:16.000 align:middle line:10%
>> When the pharaoh
or when the initiate,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:10%
the devotee was put
in that sarcophagus,

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:10%
I think there was a
sympathetic resonance.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:10%
When a particular
point in space time

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:10%
resonates at a
particular frequency,

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.400 align:middle line:10%
it causes it to connect with a
different point of space time,

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:10%
which has that same resonance.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what allows
the psychic body

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of the pharaoh or the
initiate to literally travel

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:84%
from this point to that
point across space time.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:10%
The only thing I would
assume is that there

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:10%
is a similar type of structure
set up on a planet in the Orion

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:10%
Nebula, so when
this is resonating,

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:10%
it resonates with that.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it just brings the
person's consciousness

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:90%
from this state to that state.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The three pyramids at Giza
in their geographical graphical

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.760 align:middle line:84%
positions reflect the
astronomical positions

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.940 align:middle line:84%
of the three belt
stars of Orion.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.750 align:middle line:84%
You see the Great Pyramid
as one of those stars,

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:90%
and that star is Alnitak.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the confirmations
of the connection

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
between the Great
Pyramid and Alnitak

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
is that in the
King's Chamber you

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
have an air shaft
that is directed

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.340 align:middle line:84%
at this particular
star, Alnitak,

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.870 align:middle line:84%
as it reaches its
so-called culmination,

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:84%
in other words, the highest
point that it reaches in the sky

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:84%
before it starts
going down again.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is confirmation
that there's

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:58.050 align:middle line:84%
a relationship with
the portal that we

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:90%
would identify with Orion.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the fascinating
things about considering

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
the King's Chamber, the
Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:84%
as a device with the ability to
open a portal into other realms,

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:84%
when the environment inside
of the King's Chamber reached

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.570 align:middle line:84%
a sympathetic
vibratory frequency,

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that resonance would
create, in theory,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:84%
the portal that would
connect those two realms.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the King's Chamber
has only two shafts, one shaft

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:84%
pointed directly
at Orion suggests

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that at least Orion was a
focus for that kind of portal.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:84%
In theory, it could be used as
a portal for other locations

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
if the users, if the initiates
knew the sympathetic vibratory

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.580 align:middle line:84%
resonance of those
domains as well.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the ancient builders
attempt to tell us something

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.760 align:middle line:84%
that would last beyond
time immemorial?

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Each of the Zodiac
signs have been

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:84%
found on the walls of
the King's Chamber,

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.440 align:middle line:84%
pointing us to the
processional clock of time.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And what we're now
finding is that we

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:84%
are able to match where
we are in this clock

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.820 align:middle line:84%
relational to the petroglyphs
upon the walls within the King's

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Chamber.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.980 align:middle line:84%
As we look at all of this, we
start to realize another story

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:84%
is starting to emerge, the story
of Orion passing through this

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:90%
entire 24,000 cycle of time.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
This is why Orion
is so prominent

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:44.330 align:middle line:84%
all around the world, telling us
the story of the human journey

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
through the Duat, through
the experience of having

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to experience a plane of duality
so that we can transcend it.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a moment in time
when Orion remembers

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:84%
his own power, his own divinity,
as he is standing straight

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
up in the room.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we can notice
this reference even

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:84%
in The Last Supper painting
by Leonardo DaVinci,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
that the room is
actually matching

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.690 align:middle line:90%
the King's Chamber itself.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:84%
The same inscriptions on
the walls, the petroglyphs

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:84%
can be found inside the painting
of The Last Supper itself.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo left us an incredible
inscription through time,

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.750 align:middle line:84%
each of the apostles
representing the Zodiac

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus and the
missing 1/14 of Orion.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.640 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is
the story that's

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.180 align:middle line:84%
being told in the Great Pyramid,
that there was obviously

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:84%
energy that is coming off of
that as a secondary purpose.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, the
purpose of the King's Chamber

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.000 align:middle line:90%
is a stargate.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Each of the blocks
are irregularly sized,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that
each of those blocks

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:84%
represents a
different coordinate

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.350 align:middle line:84%
within space time that can be
accessed when the sarcophagus is

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.620 align:middle line:84%
placed in its original position
at the center of the room,

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:84%
exactly over and framing the
three belt stars of Orion.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>> We may have the physical
evidence and have had

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:14.150 align:middle line:84%
for hundreds of years of
a device that helps us

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:84%
to understand on a deeper level,
our relationship to higher

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
realms, our relationship to
other worlds, other dimensions,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship to our body
as a potential portal that opens

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.920 align:middle line:84%
the door to precisely these
kinds of understandings.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.950 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid, the King's
Chamber, the sarcophagus,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and the evidence that was
left behind is a mystery.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Only by understanding a deeper
relationship between geometry,

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:47.540 align:middle line:84%
chemistry, geology
and the cosmos

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.910 align:middle line:84%
that we are going
to understand what

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:90%
happened on Giza so long ago.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we
can understand that

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
is to understand ourselves and
our relationship to the cosmos

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.780 align:middle line:90%
and the world around us.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:90%
