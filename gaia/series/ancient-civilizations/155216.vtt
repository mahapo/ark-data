Just south of the Great Pyramid

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:84%
River, this mythical limestone

and the head of a human.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx is the oldest known
monumental sculpture in Egypt.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.300 align:middle line:84%
According to
mainstream scholars,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:84%
it was built by
ancient Egyptians

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.350 align:middle line:84%
during the reign of the Pharaoh
Khafre between the dates 2558

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and 2532 BC.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:10%
But in 1992, author and
independent Egyptologist John

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:10%
Anthony West claimed that
the Great Sphinx of Giza

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:10%
was not carved in 2500 BC but
9,000 to 10,000 years earlier,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:10%
before Egypt was a desert, and
even before the dawn of man

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:10%
as we know it.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:10%
While studying the works of
1920s Schwaller de Lubicz,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:10%
John Anthony West discovered
that conventional Egyptologists

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:10%
had overlooked an
important detail.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The body of the Sphinx
bore distinct markings

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:90%
of water erosion.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
If it was water erosion,
then the entire history

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
of ancient man would
have to be rewritten.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:84%
The conversation was a
controversial subject

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:84%
the Oxford geologist didn't
want to get involved with.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.980 align:middle line:84%
This did little to deter
John West from wanting

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:90%
to solve the mystery.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:84%
If the Great Sphinx
of Egypt was built

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years earlier
than was written in mainstream

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
history, could the water
erosion marks he'd examined

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:84%
shed new light on the
creation of the human race?

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Determined to find out,
John sought other scientists

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:90%
willing to join his quest.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.160 align:middle line:84%
His search led him to Professor
Robert Schoch, a geologist

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.770 align:middle line:90%
at Boston University.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I first went to see
the Sphinx in 1990.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed immediately
that there was a disconnect.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:10%
Because the weathering
and erosion that I saw on

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:10%
the Sphinx was not
compatible with Sahara Desert

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:10%
hyper-arid conditions.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
What I was seeing,
I was convinced,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:84%
was precipitation weathering
and erosion from rainfall,

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:90%
from water beating down on it.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do you
have that when it's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
been Sahara Desert for
5,000 or more years?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So immediately, I
saw this anomaly.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And the logical
conclusion I had, again,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:84%
virtually immediately, was
that the Sphinx must go back

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:90%
to a earlier climatic regime.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Can the water-erosion marks
that John West discovered stand

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
alone to prove the Sphinx was
constructed before 2500 BC?

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
In 2008, geoarcheologists
Manichev and Parkhomenko

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
argued that through their
research of the analyzation

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
of erosion on the Sphinx they
figured it actually was part

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:90%
of a civilization much older.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Two Ukrainian geologists
believe that the Sphinx,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:10%
which is on the edge
of the plateau at Giza,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:10%
could be as much as
800,000 years old.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Why do they believe this?

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:84%
What they propose is that,
originally, the Mediterranean

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Sea extended all the way
to the plateau of Giza

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and lapped up against
the Sphinx to create

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
the distinctive weathering
patterns that we see.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that they could be
right about the weathering.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we're
talking about the Sphinx

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:84%
before it was actually carved
into what we see today.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.230 align:middle line:84%
There was a rocky
promontory or knoll

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.327 align:middle line:84%
at that site which obviously was
later used to carve the Sphinx.

00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And that would have had
weathering patterns on it.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But almost certainly, that does
date back hundreds of thousands

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
of years and could well
have been weathered by water

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:90%
at some point in the past.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, that was
not in the recent past.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.910 align:middle line:10%
>> As theories about how
old the Sphinx is continue,

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:10%
Robert Schoch has found his
research keeps leading him back

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:10%
in time.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Since he first traveled
to Giza in 1992,

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
professor Robert
Schoch's research

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
has taken his first dating
of the Sphinx even further.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
His most recent geological
and seismic findings

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:84%
have convinced him that
the Great Sphinx could

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
have been carved as far
back as 12,000 years ago

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the last ice age.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We know, geologically,
and from studies of ancient

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
climatology, that
prior to about 3000,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
what is now Sahara was much
more moist, much more temperate,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:90%
much more rainfall.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So I concluded that had to go
back at least to that earlier

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
My initial estimate
was 5000 to 7000 BC.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
This was very, very
radical at the time.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:10%
That Egyptologists
were livid about this.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
They were saying all
kinds of nasty things

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:84%
about me, calling me
a pseudo scientist.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Because, they said, this
was absolutely impossible.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no
civilization when

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
you go back to 5000 to 7000 BC
that can construct the Sphinx.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Since then, I've
continued my studies.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:90%
I've carried on with this.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
I've actually re-analyzed
the seismic data.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced at
this point, for a number

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
of technical reasons, that
actually, the seismic data

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
suggests that we have to go back
to at least around 10,000 BC.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And this also fits much
better the climatic regime

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and gives enough
time for the erosion

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and weathering
that we're seeing.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:10%
>> When could the Sphinx have
been exposed to what turns out,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:10%
what needs to have been, about
1,000 years of very heavy

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.243 align:middle line:10%
rainfall.

00:07:02.243 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
There was no rainfall
like that in Egypt

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
in the time of the
pharaohs either.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The Giza Plateau was as dry
4 and 1/2 thousand years ago

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:90%
as it is today.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here is a structure
that has been heavily weathered

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:84%
by rainfall, which has fallen
on it for a long period of time.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.135 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back,
you know, more than 11

00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2 thousand years.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back
to 12,000 years,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
really, to get the kind
of climate conditions

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
in that part of the
Sahara that would

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
have been capable of causing
that level of erosion

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:90%
on the Sphinx.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:84%
The rainfall erosion is
most visible on the trench

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.500 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds the Sphinx.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Nobody bothered to restore that.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And there, you can see
this undulating profile,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:90%
and cuts through it.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It's classic
rainfall-induced weathering.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.150 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx's body has been
repaired again and again down.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.233 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just in the Old
Kingdom it was repaired.

00:07:57.233 --> 00:07:59.740 align:middle line:84%
There were more repairs done
in the New Kingdom, as well,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, right down
into more recent times.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:84%
They're still restoring the
core body of the Sphinx today.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:84%
This, alone, should have alerted
archaeologists to the fact

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400 align:middle line:90%
that there is a problem.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Because some of the most
extensive restorations

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx, when blocks were
applied to that rock-hewn core

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:84%
body of the Sphinx to
repair damage, some of those

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.360 align:middle line:84%
dates from the Old Kingdom
they date from 2500 BC.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you made your Sphinx
in 2500 BC, what on Earth

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
are you doing restoring
it massively in 2000?

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:90%
It should be pristine?

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
>> Gregg Braden adds
another layer to the dating

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.015 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx.

00:08:38.015 --> 00:08:40.390 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at the mystery
of the Sphinx and the Giza

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:10%
Plateau and the traditional
dating of only 4,000 years,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:10%
where that no longer makes sense
is the erosion on the Sphinx

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:10%
has now been proven by Robert
Schoch to be fluvial erosion

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.890 align:middle line:10%
rather than aeolian erosion.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And fluvial means vast amounts
of water moving quickly

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:84%
over long periods of time
where aeolian erosion but

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
would be wind
blowing and eroding

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:90%
over long periods of time.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch showed
beyond any reasonable doubt

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
that it is water erosion
that has created the Sphinx.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.710 align:middle line:10%
His findings were accepted by
AAPG, the American Association

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.423 align:middle line:10%
of Petroleum Geologists.

00:09:22.423 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:90%
They looked at the evidence.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And they said, of course,
this makes perfect sense.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:90%
We have no problem with this.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
The historians have
a huge problem.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the last time there were
vast amounts of water moving

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.990 align:middle line:84%
quickly over long
periods of time

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.140 align:middle line:84%
is when the ice melted
from the last ice age.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is now being dated,
in that part of Egypt,

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
between 7,000 And 9,000
years before present.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So I think the evidence
strongly supports

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx was in place
when that water was melting.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:84%
What it doesn't
account for is the Ice

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Age was there for 20,000 years.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Was the Sphinx built
before the ice happened

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:90%
and subject to the erosion?

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Or is was Sphinx built
while the ice was in place?

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know the
answer to that yet.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Some researchers suggest
that the Sphinx could have been

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:84%
built during the
precessional cycle,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:84%
even before the current one,
giving it the date of 36,000

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> John Anthony West's
view is that, actually,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.502 align:middle line:84%
it's not marking 12 and
1/2 thousand years ago.

00:10:30.502 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:10%
It's marking the
precessional cycle

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.210 align:middle line:10%
before that, the
previous Age of Leo,

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:10%
which would be 25,920
years before that.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:10%
The age of Leo recurs
every 25,920 years.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:10%
So the astronomy
doesn't absolutely

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:10%
commit us to the date of 12
and a half thousand years ago.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.455 align:middle line:84%
But what does, I think,
committed to the date of 12

00:10:49.455 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 thousand years
ago is the geology,

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
the way that the
Sphinx is measured,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:59.080 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that was a
very rainy period in Egypt.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:04.030 align:middle line:84%
If you wind back the
ancient skies to 10,500 BC,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
you go over to
Giza, and you find

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.890 align:middle line:84%
that two constellations are
modeled on the ground there.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.860 align:middle line:84%
One is the constellation of
Orion, the belt stars of Orion,

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and the positioning of
the three Great Pyramids.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And the other is
the constellation

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.200 align:middle line:84%
of Leo with the Great
Sphinx gazing due east.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And the strangest thing is
that you again get a lock,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.660 align:middle line:84%
not in 2500 BC when Giza is
supposed to have been created.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:90%
None of it works then.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back 12 and 1/2
thousand years to 10,500 BC

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
to get Leo locking perfectly
with the Sphinx at dawn

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:90%
on the spring equinox.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:90%
It's the age of Leo.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:84%
It's as though the
lion-bodied Sphinx

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.840 align:middle line:84%
is looking at its own celestial
counterpart in the sky.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And the constellation
of Orion due south

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
on the meridian,
exactly the pattern

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.260 align:middle line:84%
of the three pyramids
on the ground.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And that only happens 12
and 1/2 thousand years ago.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.670 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Sphinx and the
pyramids have been built

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:90%
at the same time?

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
If so, could the ancient
civilization that built it

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:84%
be marking a very important
time for our current human race?

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, with modern
computer software,

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
we can look at the ancient
skies in any period we wish.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting when we switch
from geology to astronomy.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And we start looking at
the Sphinx and the pyramids

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:84%
as astronomically-connected
monuments.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.010 align:middle line:90%
And we can't do otherwise.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the Sphinx,
as I mentioned,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:84%
is perfectly aligned
on due east, perfect.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.455 align:middle line:84%
That's the work of people
who are studying the sky.

00:12:38.455 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.093 align:middle line:84%
>> The temple has to be a
mirror image of the cosmos.

00:12:45.093 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:10%
In other words, you have to
represent what you're actually

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:10%
looking at.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.540 align:middle line:10%
A great example, of
course, is the Sphinx.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:10%
Looks at its mirror image
on the horizon of the spring

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.037 align:middle line:10%
equinox 10,500 BC.

00:12:56.037 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Schoch challenges the
conventional explanation behind

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx being
constructed in 2500 BC.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been claimed that the
face of the Sphinx is the face

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Pharaoh
Khafre or Chephren.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:90%
So that would date to 2500 BC.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:84%
But all of this is really
very circumstantial.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:10%
I think there's a very good
possibility that the Sphinx was

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:10%
not a Sphinx originally
but it was a lion,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:10%
so a lion's body
with a lion's head,

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:10%
that the human head is a
reconstruction or a re-carving.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the head's been
re-carved more than once.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:84%
But if you think about as a
lion, during the age of Leo,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.510 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the last ice
age, circa 10,000 or so BC,

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.630 align:middle line:84%
you had the Sphinx face
seen its, essentially,

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:84%
own image in the sky
on the vernal equinox.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think this was
something that may have

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:90%
been incredibly significant.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be the purpose
of such a marker at the Giza

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Plateau?

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Is there an unseen power
that generations later

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:90%
tried to capture.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of a lion image
as an important sacred notion

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
in a solar-worshipping culture
is completely understandable.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.100 align:middle line:10%
First of all, the
constellation's in the heavens.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:10%
So we're looking
upward for inspiration.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:10%
And the image of a lion has a
very strong, courageous, noble

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:21.860 align:middle line:10%
quality.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So to put the head of a
pharaoh on the body of a lion

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
is to acknowledge
that the pharaoh has

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:90%
these great, powerful qualities.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:90%
This is carved out of bedrock.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Not only is the
leader's energy united

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
with the image of a lion, it
is also united with the Earth.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So we have powerful imagery
of integration going

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:90%
on in the Great Sphinx of Giza.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Could there be a different
kind of power we haven't yet

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
been able to understand attached
with the Sphinx and the Giza

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.313 align:middle line:90%
Plateau?

00:14:54.313 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's bizarre.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:10%
I mean, these are
gigantic monuments

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:10%
left totally uninscribed.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.840 align:middle line:10%
Not even the name of
the supposed pharaoh,

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:10%
no architect's name, nothing.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have hieroglyphs.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have inscriptions.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.900 align:middle line:10%
But they do speak, once you
understand the language that

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:10%
has been incorporated where the
designer, who used language,

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:10%
used mathematics and astronomy.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Sphinx was a powerful
image built only to reflect its

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
magnificence from the surface
of the Earth to its celestial

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
home, why would
it be uninscribed?

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Why would the creators
not explain its purpose?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
That answer might
lie below its feet.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch described how
his investigations led him

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to another
significant discovery.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Below the Sphinx,
I was looking

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:10%
for subsurface-weathering
features,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.830 align:middle line:10%
mineral logical changes.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:84%
We also found a
number of anomalies.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the anomalies,
probably the most

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:84%
important and significant,
is under the left paw

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Sphinx.

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is-- what we can
tell from the seismic,

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite convinced that
it is a cavity, but not

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:84%
a natural cavity, an
artificial cavity or chamber

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:90%
under the left paw.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Our initial analysis indicates
that there is something in it.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's not an empty cavity.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> John Anthony West
and Robert Schoch,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:84%
in the very brief period that
they had access to the Sphinx,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
they ran side-scan sonar
survey all around it.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And what was discovered beneath
the left forepaw of the Sphinx,

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.925 align:middle line:84%
down at a depth of about 30
or 40 feet into the bedrock

00:16:34.925 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
beneath the left
forepaw of the Sphinx,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
is a very large, clearly
man-made chamber.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.910 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the
Egyptian authorities

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.040 align:middle line:84%
discovered what they
were really doing,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
they threw them off the site.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't allowed to
continue with their work.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Do, perhaps, the
Egyptian authorities,

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.880 align:middle line:84%
or the Egyptian archaeologists,
and their colleagues

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:84%
in Western archaeology's, do
they perhaps already know?

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not a big
conspiracy theorist.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But there have subsequently
been drilling and investigation

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
projects under the Sphinx
which have been passed off

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.442 align:middle line:84%
as being to do with
clearing groundwater

00:17:07.442 --> 00:17:08.359 align:middle line:90%
from under the Sphinx.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder if that's what
they were really doing.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're being told
the whole truth about what

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:90%
is happening at Giza.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> If that might be true, could
the Great Sphinx be guarding

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:84%
human behavior recorded for
thousands or millions of years?

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing I would
anticipate finding,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:84%
if there is something in those
chambers beneath the Sphinx,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
is the records of those earlier
civilizations that existed

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Plato, the Greek philosopher,
said that the Greek law maker

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Solon once went to Egypt.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And he was speaking with one
of the Egyptian high priests.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:10%
And the Egyptian high priest
asked about the history

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:10%
of the Greek people.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And Solon, in the beginning,
humans were created.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Then there was a big
flood, a big catastrophe.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And after that, they
were created again.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.660 align:middle line:10%
And the Egyptian
priest began laughing.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:10%
He was he explained to
Solon that, actually, there

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:10%
have been many devastations in
the long history of the world.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:10%
And the Earth has been
repopulated again, and again,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:10%
and again over the course
of many millions of years.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you Greeks
just remember the last one.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But there have been
many before that.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And he said to Solon,
you've lost the records

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:90%
of these earlier histories.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptian priest said,
we have those records

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:10%
of those earlier histories.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>> These things that are still
there underground were so vast

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:90%
that he was really perplexed.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And he asked the Egyptian priest
who was taking him around,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:90%
who built these things?

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And their reply to
him was they were

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:90%
built by the crocodile kings.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might be
a perfect definition

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:90%
of what the Anunnaki were.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we do see a lot
of depictions of them

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.090 align:middle line:84%
with reptilian features
and things like that.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:10%
>> It may be at one point,
whoever built that chamber,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:10%
and had, what I believe
might be the hall of records

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:10%
of the Egyptian priesthood, then
chose to actually bury that up.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We might find writings
from the tablets ways

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
of using their
knowledge that they

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:84%
knew we wouldn't
be able to get to

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.320 align:middle line:84%
until a certain point
in our evolution

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:84%
where we wouldn't be able to
get down to these chambers

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and pull out what was there.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> If there really is a
chamber guarding the secrets

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.110 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, why haven't
we been allowed to have it?

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Graham Cere explains
that the Sphinx

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
tests the soul before it can be
embodied in the great knowing.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sphinx, to me, represents
kind of the holder of esoteric

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and the
mystery of existence.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.720 align:middle line:10%
It's sort of the watcher of
the gates to heaven and tests

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:10%
the soul on their
merit before they're

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:10%
able to re-enter the garden,
sort of like the Cherubim

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.720 align:middle line:10%
who, with the flaming swords,
guard the entrance to Eden

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:10%
to make sure that the soul
is pure enough to re-enter.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's one aspect
of the Sphinx.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.520 align:middle line:84%
To me, it also
kind of represents

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
the integration of angelic
natures with human natures.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Sphinx does mark the
gateway to secret knowledge

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:84%
about our planet, left by an
ancient high civilization,

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:84%
then could it be
that, by design,

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
it is intended to remain dormant
until modern civilization is

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:84%
ready to see the
universe differently?

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Graham Hancock suggests
this question is partially

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:06.110 align:middle line:84%
answered by understanding the
symbolism in Egyptian artworks.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient Egyptians
had a, I think,

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful way of
looking at human life.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:90%
This was a forgiving culture.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:90%
They understood human frailty.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:90%
We are not perfect.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:90%
We do not enter life perfect.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.130 align:middle line:90%
We are going to make mistakes.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, do we
learn from those mistakes?

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:84%
What do we do with the lessons
that duality has to teach us?

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Do we integrate those lessons
into our life subsequently?

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Or do we just ignore them
and carry on as before?

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, these sites
are very controversial.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:90%
All of them are.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.652 align:middle line:84%
Because they force historians to
rethink the traditional story.

00:21:47.652 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to look at a
cyclic model of civilization

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:84%
rather than the linear model
that says civilization began

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.390 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago,
it opens the door

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:84%
to explanations to
many of the things that

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:84%
look simply mysterious
to us and make

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:84%
no sense at all, such as the
discovery of entire cities

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:84%
under the surface of the ocean
that we find in multiple places

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.250 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>> If the great ancient
knowledge in the chamber below

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:22.280 align:middle line:84%
the paw of the Sphinx
is inaccessible,

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the same knowledge may
exist in a different location,

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.000 align:middle line:84%
or even in a
different frequency.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:84%
Healer and author Sonia Grace
describes a mystical encounter

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.300 align:middle line:84%
meeting the ancient solar deity
Sekhmet during a remote vision.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>> When I spirit traveled
to the Great Sphinx,

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:90%
it was back in time.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.720 align:middle line:90%
My guides took me.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:90%
And we arrived around 15,000 BC.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.240 align:middle line:90%
We were met by Sekhmet herself.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.470 align:middle line:90%
She was standing there.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:90%
She's huge!

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.990 align:middle line:90%
She's, like, 20 feet tall!

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:90%
She's enormous!

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:10%
And she invited us
inside and took us down,

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:10%
going into the Earth, a long
tunnel, this deep tunnel,

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:10.510 align:middle line:10%
passageway.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.310 align:middle line:90%
It went this way.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It went that way.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:90%
It went this way again.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And it opened out
into a huge room.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this was
the portal for my people.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:25.370 align:middle line:84%
She says, my people came here
long before the Egyptian gods.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
She said, this Sphinx
was a carving of a lion.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:90%
It was not the dog Anubis.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:90%
It was a lion.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And she said it's
because we come

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:90%
from the Leo constellation.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was created as
a sight for her people,

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.400 align:middle line:84%
meaning X marks the
spot, this is the portal.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is where her
people would literally

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:84%
transport to where they were
from in the Leo constellation.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Sphinx and the
Great Pyramid are just the tip

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of the iceberg of our
understanding of humanity

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, could their
existence be a reminder to dig

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
deeper?

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But when, if ever,
will this knowledge

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:90%
be available to all mankind?

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> For all its technology,
and all its progress,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and all the amazing
stuff we have,

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
we live in a very fractured,
very dangerous world right now,

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:84%
where the whole of human
achievement could be put

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:84%
at jeopardy by, for example,
a massive nuclear war.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:84%
We have the toys to do
that, to bring humanity

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:84%
back to the stone age,
in a matter of days.

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible
that we could do so,

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that we don't really know why
we're here or what we're doing.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.630 align:middle line:84%
We have an illusion
about what it is.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And that illusion is
locked deep in the past.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:90%
That's where it began.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:10%
And we need to recover
the truth about ourselves.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Could the knowledge preserved
be by the Clan of Osiris?

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:10%
Is there a link between
the Egyptian gods

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:10%
and Enki's mission to
help mankind's advancement

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:10%
towards a higher culture?

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Could that specific knowledge
be below the Sphinx?

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:10%
>> The Great Pyramid,
in particular,

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.958 align:middle line:10%
contains a sort of
mathematical code.

00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:24.500 align:middle line:84%
We know for sure, for example,
that astronomy and mathematics

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.300 align:middle line:90%
were used.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.270 align:middle line:90%
The question is why?

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:10%
It's the sort of-- well,
it's the universal language.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:34.460 align:middle line:84%
If ever we are contacted or
we contact extraterrestrials

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:84%
somewhere else in the cosmos,
the only way we can communicate

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:84%
is through mathematics
and astronomy.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Astronomy, we're given a
location, a sort of GPS,

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And mathematics would be
the dialogue between us.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So this monument is
speaking ET, if you like.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
It's actually speaking
in a universal language.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to come
to terms with that.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And we have to ask
the question, is it

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
something that developed
purely earthbound?

Or is it a contact?

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The questions are
legitimate today.

>> Maybe once we tap into
a different dimension,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.620 align:middle line:10%
we will be able
to read the code.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Some believe there are locations
on the planet that open portals

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:84%
to another dimension
of our current reality.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What we do know is in places
like the Cairo Museum in Egypt,

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:30.070 align:middle line:84%
a number of artifacts have
been found from sites such

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.550 align:middle line:84%
as Sakkara, for example,
that scientists simply cannot

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:90%
explain.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next, could there have
been portals on Earth where

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:90%
the code is revealed?
