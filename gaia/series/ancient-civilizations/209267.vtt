00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Edfu, Egypt.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:84%
This ancient town is located
on the Western side of the Nile

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.350 align:middle line:84%
River in upper Egypt,
60 miles South of Luxor.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:10%
In the mid-19th century, French
Egyptologist Auguste Marriette

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:10%
is credited with uncovering the
mysterious ruins here, Temple

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:10%
Edfu.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Since then, researchers
and the general public

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
have been fascinated
by this temple complex.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
But what lies written on
the walls of this temple

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
could shed light on a much
older lineage of humanity

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.330 align:middle line:10%
According to mainstream
experts, the ruins at Edfu

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:10%
were built between
237 and 57 BCE.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And archeologists
generally consider

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
the first dynastic period
of the great Egyptian rulers

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.160 align:middle line:84%
described on the walls
at Edfu to begin around

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:90%
5,500 years ago.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But do the ancient
writings, known as Zep Tepi,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
inscribed on this temple
clue to the existence

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
of a much older pre-diluvian
time in Egyptian history?

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Could there have been
a time when gods walked

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:90%
among the humans on Earth?

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, what knowledge
did they leave behind for us

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:84%
that we have barely scratched
the surface of understanding?

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:10%
>> As fascinating as the
monuments in Egypt are to me

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:10%
today, my first journey
in the 1980s, 1986,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:10%
what I learned from the
people, the Egyptians,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:10%
themselves proved to
be just as fascinating

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.630 align:middle line:10%
as the archeological remnants.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Because when I ask
them what they believe

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
the origin of the temple sites
were in their own backyard,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:84%
what they told me is that
Egypt is much, much older

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
than traditional archeology
has been led to believe

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and that the ancient
Egyptians did not even

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:90%
call themselves Egyptians.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a time that
Egypt was known as Kemet.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:84%
When I came away from
those early conversations,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I think the phrase that
stuck with me the most when

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
I asked about who were these
first people, the phrase that

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:84%
came across so many times were
the words Zep Tepi, Zep Tepi.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And what this literally
translates into,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:90%
it means "the first time".

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.880 align:middle line:10%
And it strongly
implies that Egypt

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:10%
has evolved over a
period of cycles,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:10%
or phases, of which we are now
seeing only the most recent.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:10%
And that the Indigenous
people themselves

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:10%
acknowledge these early
phases and proudly

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.070 align:middle line:10%
trace their ancestry back to
Zep Tepi to the first time.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:10%
>> In ancient Egypt,
every temple, in theory,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:10%
had what were known as
foundation texts or building

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:10%
texts.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And what these were is how
the first ever temple in Egypt

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.690 align:middle line:90%
was established.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.730 align:middle line:10%
And there was
always a story that

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:10%
went with it to do
with the beginnings

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:10%
of Egyptian civilization and
the age of the gods, which

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:10%
was known as Zep Tepi,
which is generally

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:10%
interpreted as
meaning, the first time

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:10%
or the first occasion.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:10%
And the most complete form
of this foundation story

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:10%
is found at Edfu
in Southern Egypt.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
We would only know about it for
the work of Eve Reymond, who

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
wrote an extraordinary
book called "The Mythical

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Origin of the Egyptian Temple."

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's the only
book to date that

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
breaks down all of
these foundation texts

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and shows that
they're actually based

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
on a real history of Egypt
during what she describes

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:90%
as pre-dynastic times.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:10%
>> The Zep Tepi from the ancient
Egyptian language means "first

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:10%
time".

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:10%
And it is generally connected
to the myth of Osiris.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:10%
My studies started in
an effort to confirm

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:10%
the existence of a
lost civilization which

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:10%
lived on the planet
in the ancient times.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:10%
The same civilization,
in my opinion,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:10%
that built the pyramids
all around the world,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:10%
not only in Egypt.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:10%
And the timeline is
36,400 before Christ,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:10%
when the monument
of Giza and the sky

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:10%
were perfectly
aligned, according

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.330 align:middle line:10%
to the Thoth hermetic
concept "as above, so below".

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.120 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at the
current region we call Egypt,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:10%
what we find, based on the
evidence left behind in ancient

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.600 align:middle line:10%
temples and structures, is
that there have been multiple

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:10%
civilizations that have risen
and fallen throughout that

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:10%
region.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And the area that is
the most interest to us

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:90%
is looking at where it began.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And where it began
and when it began

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
is based on a time
period known as Zep Tepi.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Zep Tepi is an amazing time
where it was said that the gods

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:10%
came down from heaven and
turned mud into a kingdom.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Now what's interesting
is Thoth claimed,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
in the Emerald tablets, to
have built the Great Pyramid.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, I patterned this
pyramid by Earth's force

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
so that it would remain
through the ages.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And he also is the
builder of Giza,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.500 align:middle line:84%
or the master architect
of Giza itself.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Zep Tepi was
considered the golden age.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:10%
It was the age of the gods.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:10%
It was the time where
everything worked really well.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:10%
People were virtuous, they
were really in connection

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:10%
with source and higher
powers and spirits.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's also during
this period where

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
we find some of the
very early construction

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:90%
around on the planet.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And so in Egypt, we
find the pyramids

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:84%
where, even today, we can't
figure out how they did it.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that's interesting

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:84%
is as you survey
around the world,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
there are pyramids
all over the place.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at
these other pyramids,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:84%
they're all step
pyramids, they're all

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
made out of smaller
stones, they're

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:84%
not nearly as big as the
ones that you find in Egypt.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And so it tells you that
there was superior technology

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:90%
happening in Egypt.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And around the world,
these other cultures

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:56.160 align:middle line:84%
were trying to imitate that
technology in those areas.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible most
historians have completely

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:90%
underestimated the timeline?

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
That more than 36,000
years before Common Era,

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.400 align:middle line:84%
there was a sophisticated
culture in the Nile Delta

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:90%
region we now know as Egypt?

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:10%
Robert Bauval, the
Egyptian born author,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:10%
has been providing intriguing
insights on the Giza Plateau

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.770 align:middle line:10%
since the publication
of his first book,

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:10%
"The Orion Mystery" in 1994.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:10%
>> So there is an interesting
correlation that Robert Bauval

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:10%
found between the placement
of the pyramids on Giza

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:10%
and the belt stars of Orion.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Now remember Orion is actually
a very important constellation

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:84%
to the Egyptians, to
the ancient Egyptians,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
because he represented Osiris,
which is the God the afterworld

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:90%
and renewal.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:10%
Now one thing that
Robert Bauval noticed

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:10%
is that if we were to look at
the belt stars of Orion today,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:10%
they don't quite match up
exactly where the pyramids are.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
So he did some work and he
found out that 10,500 BC,

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:84%
those stars almost exactly
aligned with the pyramids right

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:90%
where they needed to be.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And this was the foundation of
his Orion correlation theory.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.730 align:middle line:84%
What's even more fascinating
is he found out not only

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
did those three
belt stars of Orion

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
match the location
of those pyramids,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%
but we're looking at heaven
on Earth, as above, so below.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.860 align:middle line:84%
That the ancient
Egyptians, as they

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.150 align:middle line:84%
were designing the Giza Plateau
in the time of Zep Tepi,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to match
the heavenly bodies

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.140 align:middle line:84%
on the earthly
body so that there

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:84%
was a direct correlation
of the celestial beings

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:90%
to the earthly beings.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
Also, what Bauval noticed
was that in the year 10,500,

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that the placement
of the Sphinx on Giza

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
also matched the
location of Leo.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And he went, that's
very interesting.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Because 10,500 was
also the age of Leo.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And what the age of Leo is,
is on the vernal equinox,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
the rising sun comes up in
the constellation of Leo.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to denote that
this was a very important time

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.570 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Robert Bauval is one of the
most important researchers ever

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:10%
because he earned the great
merit in opening a new way

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:10%
of investigation of
the mysteries of Giza

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:10%
and of the pyramids.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:10%
Because for the first
time in history,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:10%
he introduced a
model of analysis

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:10%
and that gave us the opportunity
to understand and to study

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:10%
the Giza pyramids from a
different point of view.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:10%
Now observing the astronomical
map at 10,500 before Christ,

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:10%
I noted a key point.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:10%
The Orion constellation
is not perfectly aligned

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:10%
with the pyramids.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:10%
If we assume that the Zep Tepi
is an ancient time during which

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:10%
the gods lived on
Earth, we must also

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.370 align:middle line:10%
say that on the Giza
Plateau somewhere,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.760 align:middle line:10%
there is a monument
that refers to the star

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:10%
Sirius in connection
with the Goddess Isis.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:10%
>> The late John Anthony West,
author of "Serpent in the Sky,"

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:10%
also introduced an
alternative theory on the date

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:10%
of the construction of the
monuments on the Giza Plateau.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.400 align:middle line:84%
West was also a proponent
of the water erosion

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:84%
theory around the base
of the Sphinx that

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:84%
was introduced in the 1950s
by French mystic Schwaller

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:90%
de Lubicz.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:10%
>> So initially, when Robert
Bauval and Graham Hancock were

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.530 align:middle line:10%
discussing the
origin of the Sphinx,

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.710 align:middle line:10%
they proposed a date that
seems fairly reasonable,

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:10%
around 10,500 BC.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:10%
But then along
comes West, and he's

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:10%
looking at the conditions
of the Earth at that time.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Things were in upheaval.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
turmoil, there's

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:84%
some environmental
disasters going on.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.470 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the structures
of the Giza Plateau,

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
it looks like they had a very
stable and solid civilization,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that there was no upheaval
or turmoil going on.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:10%
So he proposed, when he looked
even further back in time,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.980 align:middle line:10%
that maybe the Sphinx was
denoting a previous age of Leo,

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.170 align:middle line:10%
way back in the processional
cycle at 36,000 BC.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.858 align:middle line:84%
And then as eons
passed, we come across

00:11:14.858 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:84%
many different calamities
hitting the Earth, especially

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:90%
the Younger Dryas period.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we come
in to seeing the big water

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:84%
erosion all over the Sphinx
and across the Giza Plateau,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that these
structures were already

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
in place during
the Younger Dryas

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and received a massive amount
of erosion during that period.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Another piece of data that
has come to light that adds

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%
credence to the fact that the
monuments on the Giza Plateau,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:84%
the three pyramids
and the Sphinx,

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
may date far beyond what has
been believed to be possible

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:84%
in the past is the erosion marks
on the Great Pyramid itself.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Inside the Great Pyramid
and on the exterior,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
there are markings where the
lower third of the pyramid

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:90%
has been underwater.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.840 align:middle line:90%
It has been underwater.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And the saline
content in the stone,

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
you can see the salt markings,
as well as the discoloration

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:90%
from that water.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> If salt levels are high and
the Nile River is a freshwater

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
source that flows
from the south,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
where did the salt in
the water come from?

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.770 align:middle line:84%
We must turn our
attention north,

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
to the broken ice
wall in the North Pole

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
flooding the Mediterranean
Sea, engulfing the Nile Delta.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Now observing Bauval's
astronomical map,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:10%
Sirius is under the horizon
line and it is not visible from

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:48.880 align:middle line:10%
Giza.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:10%
But in the alignment of
36,000 before Christ,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.120 align:middle line:10%
Sirius is above the horizon
line and perfectly visible

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.620 align:middle line:10%
from Giza.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:10%
And the perfect alignment
dates back at 36,400

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:10%
before Christ, when the pyramids
were aligned with Orion's belt.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:10%
I achieved the result focusing
the processional cycle

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.210 align:middle line:10%
of Equinox, and
following Bauval's model

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.650 align:middle line:10%
of investigation.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:10%
But using modern
technical devices,

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:10%
I discovered some
interesting clues

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:10%
that led me to the new
starting point, which

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:10%
is the astronomical
configuration at 36,400

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:10%
before Christ.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.590 align:middle line:10%
The Orion constellation
is not perfectly

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:10%
aligned with the
pyramids because

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:10%
on the celestial meridian,
there is a smaller

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:10%
star of the belt, the star
Mintaka, and not the greatest

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:10%
Alnitak as we expected.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:10%
The second limit is
that if we assume

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:10%
that Zep Tepi is a reminder of
an ancient time during which

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:10%
the gods lived on
Earth, we must also

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:10%
say that the goddess
Isis had basic role

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:10%
in the dramatic history
during the Golden Age

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Southeast of the pyramids
is a lesser known mastaba,

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.130 align:middle line:10%
or flat-roofed tomb, that was
attributed to Queen Khentkawes,

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.850 align:middle line:10%
who lived in Egypt during
the fourth and fifth dynasty.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But as with most apparent
tombs, the original purpose

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
for this site appears to
add to the Zep Tepi mystery.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:10%
>> The Khentkawes mastaba is a
fascinating monument with very

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:10%
particular shapes.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:10%
The monument's disposition seems
to move towards the Southwest.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:10%
Suppose we join with two red
lines the northwest angles

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:10%
throughout the mastaba
center and the west side.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:10%
In that case, we obtain a design
that looks like the Canus Major

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:10%
constellation, having the
star Sirius as its vortex.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.170 align:middle line:10%
It could be considered an effort
to describe the constellation

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:10%
and Giza, explaining why
they built the mastaba

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:10%
with a different
geographical position

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:10%
than the other monuments.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:10%
If we observe the west
side of the ridge,

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:10%
we see evidence of
water erosion that

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:10%
is very similar to
the Sphinx erosion.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:10%
We can assume that the lower
carved part of the mastaba

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:10%
is the same age as the Sphinx
because of the same water

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:10%
erosion present.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Another interesting monument
with ties to the night sky

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:84%
in 36,400 BCE is the
Sphinx temple complex.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:10%
>> The Sphinx complex looks like
a kind of microcosm composed

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:10%
by three buildings.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:10%
The Sphinx, the Temple of the
Valley, and the Sphinx temple.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:10%
Now the question is why
those monuments were built

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.220 align:middle line:10%
and what was their purpose?

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:10%
I find the answer in
the astronomical map,

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:15.080 align:middle line:10%
observing the configuration
at 36,400 before Christ.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.280 align:middle line:10%
If we noted very
close to Regulus

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:10%
in the Lion constellation,
there are two planets, Mercury

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.830 align:middle line:10%
and Jupiter.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:10%
So I spent a long time to
take measures of the temples.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, I analyzed
some physical parameters

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:10%
of the two planets.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:10%
The dimensions of the
temples in proportion

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:10%
are the same of the
two planets calculated

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:10%
on the basis of a mathematical
constant of pi and phi.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:10%
It means that the builders
planned the temples

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.610 align:middle line:10%
using the same parameters
of Mercury and Jupiter.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>> To the west of the pyramids
lies an often overlooked

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
monument called the Tomb
of the Birds, or NC2,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that might also have ties to the
constellations during the time

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:90%
of Zep Tepi.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:10%
>> Along my
investigation at Giza,

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:15.339 align:middle line:10%
I noted that the NC2 tomb,
or Tomb of the Birds,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:10%
is positioned in
the west of Giza.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:10%
From east to west
and in the west,

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:10%
the monument correlates to
the Aquarian constellation

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:10%
is the tomb NC2, exactly
the same distance

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:10%
from the Kafre pyramids
than the Sphinx.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:10%
So it could be an
interesting connection

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:10%
between the two monuments.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:10%
And this entrance is
entirely carved in rock.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:10%
At the bottom, many natural and
artificial conduits originated

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:10%
and they look like pipes going
towards the underground of Giza

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.430 align:middle line:10%
towards the pyramids.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are still
blocked and many others

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:10%
are still unexplored.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:10%
Now according to all
that, I can assume

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:10%
that the so-called tomb
NC2, or Tomb of the Birds,

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle line:10%
is the last wonder of Giza.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.300 align:middle line:10%
The builders,
according to hermetical

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:10%
concept, "as above,
so below," replicated

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:10%
the entire celestial
vault. Maybe they

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:10%
wanted to send a precise message
about their divine knowledge

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:10%
at the dawn of the Zep Tepi.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.920 align:middle line:10%
And their knowledge was a
perfect knowledge of astronomy

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:10%
that was included in the old
monuments on the Giza Plateau.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:10%
Now let's assume that the
Great Pyramid was used

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:41.080 align:middle line:10%
to produce a kind of energy.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:10%
In my model, the subterranean
chamber had a precise function.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:10%
It was the starting point from
which the energy process began.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.560 align:middle line:10%
In the south wall of the
subterranean chamber in fact,

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:10%
there is a small shaft.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.140 align:middle line:10%
At the present, it is blocked.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:10%
By my model, it was
connected to a device

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:09.190 align:middle line:10%
flowing water from Tomb of
the Birds into the chamber.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Several theories around
the Great Pyramid being

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:84%
an energetic conductor have
added to the enigmatic nature

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.350 align:middle line:90%
of this incredible monument.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.680 align:middle line:84%
But there is a lesser known
theory around the Sphinx

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.540 align:middle line:84%
that some researchers
believe has

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
been seeded through the
ancient Egyptian texts.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.050 align:middle line:10%
>> Many wonder if it's possible
if there were actually two

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:10%
sphinxes on the Giza
Plateau, not one.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
For evidence, they point
often to the book of Amduat,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
or The Book of the
Gates, which is

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
descriptive of the
afterlife journey

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:84%
of the pharaoh in his journey of
regeneration and resurrection.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:90%
The Book of Gates have 12 hours.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
At the fifth hour we come
to a place called Rastau.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.770 align:middle line:10%
And when we look
at the imagery that

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:10%
accompanies the
fifth hour, we see

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:10%
what corresponds to
the Giza Plateau.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
We see a pyramidal structure
and we see two Sphinx,

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:84%
back to back, sitting on top
of chambers or a repository.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And this got researchers
thinking that perhaps there

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
is a second Sphinx
on the Giza Plateau.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't know of one right
now and many researchers

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:84%
believe that we would
have found it by now.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are unexcavated
mounds on the Giza Plateau

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
so it's possible that
it's still there.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:84%
But another interpretation
could be that the second Sphinx

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.640 align:middle line:90%
isn't in the material world.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx that
we see represents

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.050 align:middle line:84%
our world and the
second Sphinx is

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife realm,
or the immaterial world,

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:84%
which they thought of as a
mirror image of this world.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.602 align:middle line:90%
That's a key concept.

00:20:42.602 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Because in the afterlife,
the ancient Egyptians

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.727 align:middle line:84%
believed that we'll be doing
many of the same things

00:20:46.727 --> 00:20:49.310 align:middle line:84%
that we do in our
earthly material life.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps to find
the second Sphinx,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.070 align:middle line:84%
we've got to look beyond
the material world

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:90%
into the immaterial realm.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Another reference
to a second Sphinx

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.620 align:middle line:84%
is on what's known
as the Sphinx Stele.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a breastplate,
if you will,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:84%
in between the
paws of the Sphinx.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a granite stele that
tells the remarkable story

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:84%
of the pharaoh Thutmosis
IV in the 18th dynasty,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
who falls asleep on the
Sphinx, goes into a dream.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx tells him that
if you will clear away

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
all the sand that
is covering my body,

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
I'll make you the pharaoh,
even though you're not

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:90%
in line to become the pharaoh.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, Thutmosis
IV clears away the Sphinx

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and becomes the pharaoh, and
installs this incredible Sphinx

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Stele that shows, once again,
two sphinxes, back to back,

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:84%
sitting atop a repository
or stack chambers that

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:84%
are believed to be underneath
the Sphinx on the Giza Plateau.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:10%
>> In ancient Egyptian
mythology, usually,

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:10%
there are two lions or sphinxes
shown and these are known

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:10%
as the Ruti lions.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And they guard the
entrance and exit

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:08.380 align:middle line:84%
into what's known as
the Duat, or underworld.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
underground passage

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
that the sun was
thought to travel

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:84%
at night from, obviously,
sunset in the west

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:90%
to sunrise in the east.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And this was visualized
as an actual cave system.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:10%
And there were representations
of this cave system

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.410 align:middle line:10%
in different parts of Egypt

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the idea that
there's one Sphinx,

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:10%
it's always seemed a little bit
odd to me because things tend

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:10%
to come in twos.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:10%
They tend to be two pillars to
the establishment of society

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:10%
civilization and knowledge
in every culture.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And to have just once Sphinx
is anomalous in itself.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So there is a suggestion that
there is a parallel mountain

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Giza Plateau,
which is now

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
the highly eroded version of
its counterpart that we now see.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.760 align:middle line:10%
In the Egyptian
funeral writings,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:10%
a double lion called Aker
appears quite regularly.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And very often, this
Aker is precisely not

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
very far from the
body of Osiris,

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:18.400 align:middle line:84%
who is often represented lying
in a sarcophagus ready to be

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:90%
reborn.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, many people
think that this famous Aker

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:84%
demonstrates that
there might have

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.690 align:middle line:84%
been two sphinxes in
Egypt, the Sphinx we know

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.370 align:middle line:90%
and then another one.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
The notion of a double Sphinx is
found in the Egyptian writings.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.600 align:middle line:90%

In 1820, a powerful
discovery was

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
made by Italian traveler
Bernardino Drovetti that

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:52.530 align:middle line:84%
provides a glimpse into
the unfathomable life

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
spans of the early
kings in this region.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
This controversial ancient relic
is known as the Egyptian Kings

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:90%
List.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:10%
>> They refer to it now
as the Turin papyrus

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:10%
because it's in the Egyptian
museum in Turin, Italy.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:84%
It lists all of the
kings of Egypt going back

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
into mythological
times, including

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.240 align:middle line:84%
some impossibly long reigns
for these kings, thousands

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.660 align:middle line:84%
This perfectly corresponds
with the idea that there

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
was a time before
time as we know it,

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.240 align:middle line:84%
or Zep Tepi, when
the gods ruled.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're seeing here
is evidence in the 18th dynasty,

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.277 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Ramesses II,
the time in which the king's

00:24:33.277 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%
list is believed to
have been written,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that they knew about
this Egyptian pre-history

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
or this time of human
pre-history, Zep Tepi.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.760 align:middle line:10%
So there are several
lists of kings in Egypt,

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:55.020 align:middle line:10%
notably at Abydos, at
Karnak, on the Turin papyrus.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:10%
And it is interesting to
see that the gods rule

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:10%
for about 23,000
years and the Shemsus

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.260 align:middle line:10%
rule for about 13,400 years.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:10%
So these dates evidently create
problems for the scientists,

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:10%
for the Egyptologists.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:10%
It's impossible.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:10%
It would mean that, effectively,
these gods existed, that they

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:10%
lived for a very long time.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, these
lists were put aside.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But for most Egyptologists,
these dates mean nothing.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:90%
They're imaginary for them.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But we must calculate
a starting point

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:90%
for each Egyptian dynasty.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we must
take them into account.

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:10%
>> The timeline idea from which
Zep Tepi originated, I believe,

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:10%
is very intriguing because it
could confirm that it refers

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:10%
to an historical time
and not to a myth,

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.430 align:middle line:10%
as the mainstream
archeologically claim.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the
dating of 36,000 BC,

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that matches the Egyptian
kings list, the papyrus list.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
All of these
documents that suggest

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:11.430 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx was
built 26,000 years prior

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.020 align:middle line:90%
to the original suggestion.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Now if that were
to be the case, we

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
would have lost a
lot of the artifacts,

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
we would have lost a
lot of the structures.

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:10%
And that is actually also
indication that maybe,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.620 align:middle line:10%
just maybe, West was
absolutely correct.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:10%
That the original
time of the Sphinx,

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.120 align:middle line:10%
and the original
time of Zep Tepi,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:10%
was not 10,500 but
closer to 36,000 BC.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we begin to look
at all of this information

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:84%
together, what's happening is
we're opening the door to a new

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.630 align:middle line:84%
And we have to ask
ourselves, are we

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.060 align:middle line:84%
willing to follow the
evidence to the story

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:84%
that the evidence
leads to, or are we

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
going to put that
evidence into a box

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and try to force it to fit
into a pre-existing theory?

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the enigmatic writings
of Zep Tepi at the Temple

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:08.750 align:middle line:84%
of Edfu be explaining an actual
first time of civilization

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years before
mainstream understanding?

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
With the evidence pointing
towards a pre-diluvian culture

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:84%
that was located in the Nile
Delta region around 36,000 BCE,

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:84%
the mystery now moves to who
was this advanced culture

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:31.690 align:middle line:84%
with superior architecture
and astronomical knowledge

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and how did they
get their guidance?

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Who were these gods,
and were earlier humans

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:90%
walking among them?

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.220 align:middle line:10%
Temple Edfu holds the
clues to this ancient story

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:10%
on its walls.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But as with most
pre-diluvian cultures,

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:84%
the floods have
destroyed the blueprints.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So as in every great
hero's journey,

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:84%
we must undergo a
transformation as a species

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:84%
in order to become the
master of the two worlds,

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:08.170 align:middle line:84%
and return to our origins
to rebuild a society that

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:12.550 align:middle line:84%
is connected with the
stars, like they did it

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:90%
the first time.
