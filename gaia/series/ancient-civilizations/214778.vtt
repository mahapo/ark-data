00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Positioned between Taurus and
Canis Major is one of the most

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
anomalous constellations in our
galactic neighborhood, Orion,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.900 align:middle line:84%
referred to by the ancients
as the Heavenly Shepherd

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and the Hunter is one of the
most predominant fixtures

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
in the night sky from
January to March.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Because Orion does not lay
on Earth's ecliptic plane,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
this star cluster is
not one of Earth's 12

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:90%
Zodiac constellations.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But throughout
ancient history, Orion

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:84%
appears to have been
diligently studied, worshipped,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:90%
and tracked.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
This mysterious
cluster is the center

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:84%
of tales around time portals
and stargate technologies.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Many of these legends also
state that Orion was home

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
to several of history's
most influential gods.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:10%
As our archeological
record continues to expand

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:10%
and satellite imagery
becomes sharper,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:10%
the evidence is mounting that
Orion left a strong imprint

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:10%
on our ancient ancestors.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.980 align:middle line:84%
What other secrets does this
mysterious constellation

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.360 align:middle line:84%
hold to help alternative
researchers piece together

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.410 align:middle line:84%
an interconnected ancient
civilization aligned

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.673 align:middle line:84%
with the power and
wisdom from Orion.

00:01:56.673 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:10%
>> Throughout the world, there
is one constellation above all

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:10%
that has captured the
fascination of humanity.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:10%
And that, of course, is Orion.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Children are taught
from the time

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
that they can look into the
starry sky to identify Orion.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Orion is one of the most
familiar constellations

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:10%
of the southern sky.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:84%
It is seen as a mighty one,
a giant, a warrior, a hunter.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Orion is a figure who has
a presence in history in many

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:10%
different mythologies.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
We can look all the way back to
the Sumerian tales of Gilgamesh.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's referred to there
as the light of heaven.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And in the tale,
he's often the hunter

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:90%
who's pitted against the bull.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Arabian traditions have
Orion as like a giant figure,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:10%
but we have the Greeks and
the Romans who saw Orion

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:10%
as a hunter.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:10%
And so we have these
different depictions,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:10%
but usually, they saw Orion as
a very important godlike figure.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the oldest
traditions that we have,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:10%
and certainly written down, and
it comes from the book of Enuma

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:10%
Ur Anu, who everybody
knows as Enoch.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's not his
real name, obviously.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So he was one of the Anu,
the people of the sky god.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Anunnaki are very
interesting because they

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.900 align:middle line:84%
originally came from
the Armenian Highlands.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
In their tradition, Orion is
Ara, not just a metaphoric place

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, a specific place
where everything comes from,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
where knowledge,
where gods come from.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So the Anunnaki were intimately
associated with the Ara,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:90%
the constellation Ara, Orion.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And they came from that
location a long, long time ago.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that were
the progenitors of the Sumerian

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.450 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.825 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
it's so important.

00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so hard wired
in Armenian tradition today.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And the people are
very proud of it.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.380 align:middle line:84%
They actually call themselves
the offspring of Orion

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%
to this very day.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1979, in a
cave in Germany,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.760 align:middle line:10%
archeologists found a
tiny sliver of ivory.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And depicted on it was a man
that the archeologist identified

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:84%
as could be a star man,
could be a half human being.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But this figure has also been
identified as the constellation

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Orion.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
The figure is in exactly
the same as Orion,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
especially with the slim waist
that represents the three belt

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:90%
stars.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that this
image is 32,000 years old,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
32,000 to 38,000 years old, and
is considered one of the very

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
first images ever created
of a man of a human being.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's
fascinating because it

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.430 align:middle line:84%
suggests Orion is a place that
we want to ultimately strive

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:90%
to get to.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But this identification
of this work of art

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:84%
suggests that perhaps Orion is
the place we came from as well.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And that this artist is being
taught this by some otherworldly

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.875 align:middle line:84%
being, probably from Orion to
say, this is where you're from.

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> In the mid 1990s, alternative
Egyptology began growing rapidly

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
with the publication of the
book The Orion Mystery by Robert

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Bauval and Adrian Gilbert.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
This research proposed that the
pyramids on the Giza Plateau

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:84%
were in alignment with the
three belt stars of Orion.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:84%
This powerful insight inspired
alternative researchers

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
to look deeper into the
alignment and configuration

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Giza Plateau and other
ancient sites around the world

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:90%
that mirror the ancient sky.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Robert Bauval's work,
especially concerning the Orion

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:84%
correlation theory, was
absolutely revolutionary.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Dr. J. J. Hurtak had
previously identified or made

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:84%
the connection between
the Giza Plateau

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and the three belt
stars of Orion

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:90%
in his book The Keys of Enoch.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
But it was really Robert
Bauval who put teeth to it.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:10%
He dug so deep into
the Egyptian mysteries

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:10%
and made, virtually, an
incontrovertible case

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.420 align:middle line:10%
that the Giza
Plateau was designed

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:10%
based on a uniform
or a unified plan,

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.210 align:middle line:10%
where from the very
beginning, the builders

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:10%
intended to mirror the
belt stars of Orion

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:10%
on the Giza Plateau.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Indeed, I believe that the
process of science begins with

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.070 align:middle line:10%
observing something
that doesn't fit.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's an
anomaly, but if you

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
stop investigating because
you are pressurized

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.820 align:middle line:84%
by peers or by your
own bias, then you're

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:90%
not being a scientist.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew Robert
Bauval personally.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:90%
He's a brilliant researcher.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:10%
He's a very honest and
integral personality.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.050 align:middle line:10%
And of course, he
influenced a lot of people,

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:10%
including a few
archeologists, where

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.816 align:middle line:10%
archeology,
generally, they think

00:06:57.816 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:10%
it has another explanation.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with the stars.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Everything evolved
from evolution.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But slowly, slowly, the
spirit of time will change.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, slowly, even
the archeological community

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
comes to the idea,
yes, there must have

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.860 align:middle line:90%
been an influence from outside.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What's interesting about
it is that if you approach it

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
through the lines of
rational thinking,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:90%
you will butt against a border.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:90%
You can only take it that far.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's interesting
to me because it

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
forces you to consider
another way of thinking,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.475 align:middle line:84%
a thinking that a lot of us,
certainly myself, because I came

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:84%
from this engineering
background,

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
has difficulty or had
difficulty in considering,

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:84%
which is metaphysical
thinking-- to enter

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:90%
another way of thinking.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
There is no way, in
my opinion, that we'll

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
understand the past if we keep
insisting that we can explain it

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:90%
through rationalistic means.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:90%
We need to think in another way.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Bauval and Gilbert's work
opened up a can of worms

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
in terms of historical
traditions because I think they

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.715 align:middle line:84%
channeled something about
traditional cultures.

00:08:03.715 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
They picked up something
that everybody knew about,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.548 align:middle line:84%
but no one really
talked about because it

00:08:07.548 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
wasn't accepted in the
mainstream academic terms.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask that in Tonga,
if you ask of that in the Hopi

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:84%
tradition, if you
ask that in Japan,

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
in India, in Britain as well,
the locals would say, well,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
absolutely, because any time
you build any amount of temples

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.270 align:middle line:84%
on the land, they have to be a
mirror image of what reflects

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
in the sky because that's
where we came from originally,

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:90%
they said.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So they opened up
this conversation.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.659 align:middle line:84%
And by opening up
the conversation,

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.140 align:middle line:84%
it starts to question
the traditions

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.090 align:middle line:90%
that we've been handed.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:40.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Robert Bauval, through his
work in the Orion mystery,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:10%
gave us the key to a deeper
understanding of our ancestors

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.100 align:middle line:10%
relationship to the stars
as they saw it in their time

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:10%
and the window to give us
deeper understandings in ours.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:10%
This opened the door
to the possibility

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:10%
that other sites,
other archeological

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:10%
sites may in fact
be earthly mirrors

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:10%
to their celestial counterparts.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And as the studies
continue, what we're finding

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:90%
is this is true.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That book struck a chord.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
It struck a chord within
me because it opened

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:90%
up two very important ideas.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:84%
One, the Orion
correlation theory.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And two, that the entire
ancient Egyptian mythological

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and religious tradition
was based on the idea

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.753 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramid was a
portal or gateway to Orion.

00:09:25.753 --> 00:09:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>> From a scientific standpoint,
we do know that the Milky Way

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:10%
galaxy, at one point in time,
actually came out of Orion.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's a sister galaxy
that we are connected with.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And that connection may prove
to be much more significant

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:90%
than people realize.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at this Orion
constellation and dig deeper

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.590 align:middle line:10%
from an astrophysics
point of view,

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:10%
we see a lot of the
creation elements.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, possibly the
creation of our solar system

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:90%
has its origin into Orion.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's very
important to study it.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> When we see the
Orion constellation,

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
we can't help but notice that
it forms a unique X shape,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
an X shape that is very similar
to the Greek letter of Chi,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:90%
also known as Chy or Chi.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:10%
And when we look to other
traditions around the world,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:10%
they tell us that Orion is a
portal for the soul's journey,

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:10%
either for the
soul to return home

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:10%
or for the soul to
reach an ascended state,

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:10%
like a light body.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we go back
to this Chi letter,

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
could that tell us
that Orion is the key

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to unlocking the
soul's journey, the key

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
to unlocking the evolution of
the soul that all of humanity

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
needs to tap into.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we came from there,
we are forever linked with it,

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:90%
just on a quantum level.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it could be some of the
structures that are built here

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
on this planet are meant to be
portals or gateways to get us

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:90%
there stargates.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, this is even
mentioned several times

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:90%
on the temples themselves.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
If you go to Egypt, there
are multiple temples that

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:90%
are referred to as stargates.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to be
pointing to Orion.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Orion is located in one
of two areas of the sky,

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
where the sun crosses
the Milky Way.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.510 align:middle line:84%
On one side of the sky, it's in
the area of Orion, the Pleiades,

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:90%
and Taurus.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of the sky,

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.520 align:middle line:84%
it is in the area of
Sagittarius and Scorpius.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And these two points
in the sky are

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:84%
considered to be like sky gates
or gateways into the sky world.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And the superhighway,
if you like, of the sky

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.230 align:middle line:90%
is the Milky Way.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So the point of entry
is seen as Orion.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of the reasons why

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:84%
we find Orion as so
important to the mythologies,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
the cosmologies, and the
positioning of ancient sites

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.090 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:10%
>> As alternative, researchers
exposed more aerial photos from

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:10%
China, another possible
Orion imprint near the center

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:10%
of the country was discovered.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>> In Xi'an in China, we have
a complex of 16 pyramids with

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
the three main pyramids
or trapezoidal mounds also

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.400 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with Orion.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> These three trapezoidal
structures are very interesting

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
because researchers have told
us that these are most likely

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:90%
burial mounds.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Which leads us to
wonder, is there

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
a connection between
these burial mounds

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.630 align:middle line:84%
being aligned with the belt
stars of Orion and the death

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:90%
process?

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:10%
Because when we look at other
cultures around the world,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:10%
we do see a cosmic connection
to the soul's journey,

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.230 align:middle line:10%
transcending from the earthly
realms into the cosmic realms.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.025 align:middle line:84%
And could that be what these
structures were used for,

00:13:20.025 --> 00:13:23.520 align:middle line:84%
as a means, like a portal,
or some sort of a connection

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
between the earthly
plane, and the cosmic,

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.975 align:middle line:84%
and the ethereal realms by way
of the constellation of Orion?

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:10%
>> We see the Orion correlation
appearing literally all over

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:10%
the world, from Xi'an, China
and the pyramids there,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:10%
to the pyramids in Giza plateau,
and then the pyramids also

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:10%
in Teotihuacan, in Mexico.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
At Teotihuacan, on
the pyramid plateau,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
we see the famous
Walk of the Dead.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:10%
And there, we have
the Pyramid of the Sun

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:10%
in the center, the Pyramid
of the Moon at the end.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:10%
And then we also have the
pyramid to Quetzalcoatl.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:10%
When we notice, across
this entire plateau,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:10%
the proportions are perfectly
matching the same proportions

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.280 align:middle line:10%
that we see on the Giza Plateau.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the base length
of the Pyramid of the Sun

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:10%
is 756 feet, which is a perfect
match to the base length

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, we see that the
height of the Pyramid of the sun

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
is 216 feet, which is a
perfect match to the smallest

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:84%
pyramid on the Giza
Plateau, Menkaure Pyramid.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And we also notice that the
height of the Great Pyramid

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of 481 is embedded and encrypted
into the design of the base

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:84%
length of the
Pyramid of the Moon.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:10%
So here we have three
perfect measurements

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.900 align:middle line:10%
that are matching
exactly what we

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:10%
find related to harmonic
relationships between the Giza

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:10%
Plateau, where there
is a clear Orion's belt

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.580 align:middle line:10%
correlation and the
Teotihuacan plateau, which

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:10%
also mirrors the same
connection and correlation.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> This could be
coincidence, or more likely,

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:84%
it points to this understanding
of what the ancient Egyptians

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:15.040 align:middle line:84%
had a clear vision of this
adage, this hermetic adage--

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
as above, so below,
as within, so without.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.260 align:middle line:84%
They equated their civilization
with this star civilization

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and believed they could
bring heaven to earth.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this then gets
translated into Christianity

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:84%
in the Lord's Prayer, on
earth as it is in heaven.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a concept that's
fundamental to these ancient

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.730 align:middle line:84%
civilizations, that when they're
looking out into the star

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:84%
fields of Orion, they're
looking at, not just home,

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
but the possibility
or the probability,

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:84%
the availability of
bringing that star energy

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:90%
to our earthly home as well.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The three pyramids on the
Giza Plateau, Teotihuacan,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and ancient China are all
aligned with Orion's belt.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally enough, if you
were to lay these out on a flat

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
surface instead of
a global surface,

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
you'll actually find that these
three sites are all aligned with

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Orion's belt as well.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Pyramids worldwide, it
doesn't matter where they are.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:90%
It could be a mound in England.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:90%
It could be the Giza Plateau.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
They are always sited
above emergence points

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:90%
of Earth energy.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, when this energy
comes out of the ground,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.290 align:middle line:10%
it's very cobra-like.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:10%
And that's literally in
alignment to those stars above.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:10%
So I think it's the
birthing place of leys.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the birthing place of earth
energies at these emergence

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.750 align:middle line:90%
And they mirror Orion.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just the skies
above, it's the earth below.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And when those two come
together, you have a portal.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When you pull back
from a satellite view,

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
whether you're looking
at China, Mexico, Giza,

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing the same idea
expressed in their monuments.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing this idea that
we can build a portal to Orion.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.035 align:middle line:84%
We can grab hold of Orion's
belt and pull ourselves

00:17:12.035 --> 00:17:12.835 align:middle line:90%
into the stars.

00:17:12.835 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
>> The Western side of South
America has long been known

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:84%
for its pre-Diluvian relics,
containing strong connections

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.190 align:middle line:90%
with the ancient sky.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:10%
But a closer look at the
eastern coastline of Brazil

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:10%
reveals another potential Orion
clue from our ancient ancestors.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The island of
Florianopolis in Brazil,

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:84%
also known as Magic Island, is
a very special place indeed.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It has been widely
rumored to have

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:84%
been the place of many
vortices, energetic centers,

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and strange phenomena that
could not be explained.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that stood out to me

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
was that there were
three megalithic sites.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.940 align:middle line:84%
The first is known
as the Dragon Head.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.320 align:middle line:84%
The second is known as
Indian Stone and the third

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:90%
is known as Dolmen.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And it sits high
upon a mountaintop.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:10%
The mountaintop looks down
on a beautiful ocean vista.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:10%
Right at the peak
of this mountain,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:10%
we find an entire
constellation set in stone.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:84%
These large megalithic
stone blocks

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:84%
that have been placed
exactly in the formation

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
of the entire Orion
constellation.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Why would there be a
Stonehenge style megalithic

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
site for Orion constellation
in Florianopolis or Magic

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Island in Brazil?

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why I started
to think, maybe

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
there is a larger structure
that represents the three belt

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:90%
stars of Orion as well.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
each one seemed

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to be about a kilometer in
distance from the other.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was not forming a
straight line, but rather

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:90%
somewhat of a broken line.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The Dolmen connected to
the Indian Stone connected

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:84%
to the Dragon Head,
was forming exactly

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
the exact same formation of
the three belt stars of Orion.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the biggest
connections to Orion is

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.180 align:middle line:90%
in Japan, of all places.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to a time
when Japan is lifted out

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:84%
of the waters of the flood,
becomes an island in the south.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And these gods arrived
in the middle of nowhere.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.890 align:middle line:90%
They deposit their wisdom.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And they create the
most ubiquitous shape

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:84%
in Japan, which is the Torii
arch, that wonderful gateway

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.920 align:middle line:84%
painted in cinnabar red, with
a wonderful cross member.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that the
cross member represents

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:90%
the belt stars of Orion.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So when you're actually going
to a sacred space in Japan,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
you're walking
through that gateway

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:90%
into the garden of the gods.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
But here's a fun
part, the Japanese

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
are very serious about that
section where you and I walk

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:84%
through because they said that
is the heart of the sky, that

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
is meant to be the place from
where civilization, knowledge,

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
where the sages came from,
and ostensibly, at one point,

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:90%
where humans also emerged from.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that the
place where you and I walk

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
through the arch happens
to coincide with the Nebula

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:84%
M42, which NASA now knows to
be the most star forming region

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:90%
in the whole of the galaxy.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying, essentially,
in this story that Orion

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:90%
is a point of creation.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
This is where everything comes
from-- gods, knowledge, sages,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:84%
all the accouterments
of civilization.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The Egyptians saw Orion from
a deeply spiritual perspective.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
They associated
the constellation

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:84%
with resurrection, with
life, with rebirth.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
The hieroglyphs in the
temple walls and the texts

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
take us beyond the verbal
traditions, the oral traditions

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:84%
of our ancestors and helping
us to understand a deeper sense

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:90%
of our relationship to Orion.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
They say that it is in the
Nebula, which is actually

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:84%
found in the sword below
the belt, that souls arise,

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:08.430 align:middle line:84%
that our souls originate
from this place.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And this may give us an insight
into why, almost universally,

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
throughout our
history, those who

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
have come before us felt such
a deep connection to this one

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.970 align:middle line:84%
particular star system,
above all others.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> According to old
Egyptian knowledge,

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Osiris is the same thing as
Orion because he told that he

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:90%
was coming from Orion.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.710 align:middle line:84%
The people asked him,
where do you come from?

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:90%
He was a teacher.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.290 align:middle line:84%
He teached humans in
different belonging.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they asked
him, where do you come from?

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And he pointed to Orion.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.630 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's my home.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.600 align:middle line:90%
That's where I come from.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The pharaohs believed
that when a pharaoh died,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
he would actually join
the constellation of Orion

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.750 align:middle line:84%
and become one of the stars
of that constellation.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating, from
an astronomical perspective

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
about Orion, is that
there's the Orion

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Nebula contained within it.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And the Orion Nebula is
the most prolific generator

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:90%
of new star formation.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So new stars are born within
the Orion Nebula all the time.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's fascinating
to see that there

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.390 align:middle line:84%
was this idea of the
kings, the pharaohs,

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
becoming new stars that joined
the Orion Nebula or the Orion

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:90%
constellation.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>> This Orion Nebula is exactly
the same place that features

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.580 align:middle line:84%
in the Native American path
of souls death journey.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
There, the souls
of the deceased,

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
but also those of the shaman,
would make a leap of faith

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:90%
to the Orion Nebula.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And this would allow them
access onto the Milky Way.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have this
world tradition.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
No matter where
you go, Orion seems

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to be the center of
culture, civilization,

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:84%
where people came from,
where the gods came from.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why it's
so ubiquitous to us,

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.830 align:middle line:84%
in every single time, that
we go out in the landscape.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And we take a look up
at the sky and go, yeah,

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:90%
that seems familiar.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Our destiny is
to return there.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Some traditions
have alluded to it

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
as after death, that we have
to go through that gate.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But others have suggested that
in our destiny, into the stars,

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:90%
if we go there, we will find--

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:84%
we'll find home, where
we originally came from.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>> If Orion played a
part in Earth's origins,

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.030 align:middle line:84%
how many other species and
planets may have been under

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.990 align:middle line:84%
the influence of this
powerful constellation?

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Orion is a massive
constellation.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.820 align:middle line:84%
The closest star is Betelgeuse,
at 640 light years away.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The furthest star is Alnitak,
which is over 1,200 light years

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.110 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Even the Orion Nebula is
found in the center star

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:84%
of Orion's sword is over
1,500 light years away.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It may be home to
hundreds, if not

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:84%
thousands of individual
civilizations

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that would have had
various sorts of influence

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:90%
all across the galaxy.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And some of them would have
made their way to earth.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, when we look to the work of
Manuel Emeri and Alex Collier,

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:10%
we get some insight to the
hunter nature of Orion.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:10%
Eons ago, humanoid beings
from the constellation of Lyra

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.870 align:middle line:10%
started to expand and
explore the galaxy.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't long before
they encountered the Draco.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:10%
And in Orion, the Draco formed
the Orion Council as a means

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:50.650 align:middle line:10%
to pursue and hunt
down the fleeing Lyran

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.900 align:middle line:10%
people across the galaxy.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:10%
One of the places they
would have stopped

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:10%
is the Pleiades,
making it their home.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.870 align:middle line:90%
They even came to Earth.

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And this may be where we get
the notion of Orion, the Hunter,

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
chasing the Pleiades, as we see
in ancient Greek, in Australian,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and Native American
lore that Orion

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is the great hunter, chasing the
Seven Sisters across the night

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:90%
sky.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Could that be reflective
of the Orion Council

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.563 align:middle line:84%
chasing down humanoid
beings across the Galaxy?

00:25:22.563 --> 00:25:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Another reference to
beings from Orion can be found

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.860 align:middle line:90%
in The Law of One.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:10%
In the early 1980s, L/L research
began recording question

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.290 align:middle line:10%
and answer sessions with a
non-physical entity by the name

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:41.730 align:middle line:10%
of Ra.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:10%
And Carla L. Rueckert
was the channel.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:10%
These profound sessions
featured insights

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:10%
about the nature and
purpose of this group.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look to The
Law of One material,

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.230 align:middle line:10%
Ra tells us about
the Orion group,

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:10%
which is a manipulative
group service to self.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
They are willing to do whatever
it takes for their own benefit.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
When we look to
ancient depictions

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
of the influence of
Orion, we see a lot more

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
of a beneficial, like
a service to others

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:84%
influence across
the ancient world,

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.340 align:middle line:84%
where they were helping
to build these cultures.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.750 align:middle line:84%
That they were helping to teach
mathematics, and sciences,

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and the architecture that helped
construct those civilizations.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what, this
influence benefited

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:84%
those civilizations,
helping them to evolve,

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:84%
helping them to grow and to
become the people we are today.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When I think of groups from
Orion, I'm thinking immediately,

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:84%
of course, of the Osiris line in
ancient Egypt that then carried

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.380 align:middle line:90%
over into Christianity.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.440 align:middle line:10%
And in both cases, the
business, if you will,

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:10%
of a group from
Orion, it is the same.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:90%
It's about resurrection.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about somehow
bringing earth, and soul,

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:84%
our solar system, on line
into the Orion system.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Indigenous cultures
spoke about the origin

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:84%
of civilization, of where
their wisdom comes from,

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.983 align:middle line:84%
the fact that their first
fathers of their culture comes

00:27:10.983 --> 00:27:11.783 align:middle line:90%
from.

00:27:11.783 --> 00:27:13.420 align:middle line:84%
They're always
adamant about Orion

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.840 align:middle line:90%
as being the source of this.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Why would they make this up?

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.880 align:middle line:84%
What reason would they have to
make up such a fanciful thing,

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.000 align:middle line:84%
unless it was true that there
was a direct experience.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And that experience
was extremely

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:84%
beneficial because
back in the day,

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:84%
we didn't care about consumer
goods or cell phones.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:84%
It was about the connection
to the landscape.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you maintain that
connection, and someone helped

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.530 align:middle line:84%
maintain that connection,
and showed you a better

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.970 align:middle line:84%
way to survive, then that gets
hardwired and physicalized

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.770 align:middle line:90%
into the culture.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as you have the
idea of extraterrestrials,

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:84%
automatically, you come
to the question, well,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.120 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials,
where are they now?

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Where did they come from?

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And especially,
will they return?

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, do I have to be
afraid of their return?

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
have to be joyful.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:90%
They want that we learn.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.660 align:middle line:90%
We are part of a family--

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:84%
of family out there
in the universe.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.645 align:middle line:90%
The universe is full of life.

00:28:13.645 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> As more relics are uncovered
throughout the planet,

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
what other imprints from Orion
will be discovered to help

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and guide humanity to reunite
with our galactic neighbors

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.766 align:middle line:90%
and our ancient ancestors?

00:28:32.766 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The legacy that our
ancestors left for us from

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:84%
their perspective of
Orion, it's ancient.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not obsolete.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:48.850 align:middle line:84%
We are now just on the verge of
making discoveries that give us

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
deep insights into who we
are, our past, our origin,

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.940 align:middle line:84%
our history, and most
importantly, our potential.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.660 align:middle line:84%
As the new technology allows
us to peer deeper into space,

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:07.150 align:middle line:84%
into the portals of
Orion, we open the door

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:10.540 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility of
even deeper understandings

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.760 align:middle line:84%
into our own history, our own
nature, and perhaps insights

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:90%
into our future.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:90%
