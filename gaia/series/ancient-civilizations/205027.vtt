just the beginning.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:10%
We know that there have
been a series of quite

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:10%
extraordinary discoveries
made at Abydos, including

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.100 align:middle line:10%
these huge boats
which were discovered

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:10%
within the cemeteries there.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And what is very clear is that
Abydos was seen as the point

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.870 align:middle line:84%
that you would pick up this
road that would take you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
into the afterlife, a
road that would initially

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
go towards the west, towards the
direction of the setting sun.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:10%
Abydos was arguably
the most important

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:10%
of all of these cemeteries in
Egypt, and that this tradition

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:10%
they continued on right the
way through the Old Kingdom

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:10%
into the New Kingdom
period when you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:10%
have this massive, great
temple complex built

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:10%
by Seti I around 1300 BC.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
incredibly large temple.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:84%
As you approach it, you see
these 12 incredibly massive,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:90%
colossal pillars--

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
6 on either side of
this gigantic entrance.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And you go into this, and it's
like being in a giant's palace,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.840 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But you pass through
this, you pass

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.760 align:middle line:84%
through all of the
different chapels,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and you eventually
break your channel

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:90%
through into this corridor.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%

It is called the
Abydos Temple Complex,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.070 align:middle line:84%
but it actually encompasses
two very, very different sites.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
One of them is very
visible to the naked eye,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and this is the Seti I temple,
which is very contemporary even

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:90%
in modern terms.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
this temple today,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
the architecture
is just exquisite.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
It is beautifully,
beautifully laid out.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that
this site is built

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
on top of an even older, more
mysterious site of very, very

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
different architecture that
is called the Osireion.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:84%
The nature of the construction
and the apparent dating

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
of that site is
contemporary of what

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:90%

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
The legacy that was
left to us today

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:84%
is simply the technology,
the extraordinary technology,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and the precision of creating
these structures in the places

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:90%
where we find them today.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, while the Sphinx itself
was carved from native stone,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:84%
the Osireion
appears to have been

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
created from the granite coming
in from the Aswan quarries.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And the way that these
structures are situated

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:84%
suggests a dating contemporary
with the Giza Plateau.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:84%
We're talking right at the
end of the last Ice Age.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%

was found in Abydos

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:10%
that dates from
approximately 7,000 years ago

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:10%

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It's important to remember that
Abydos is the site of Osiris.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:84%
He lived in Abydos, home of
his main temple, the Osireion.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Osiris died around the time of
the last great flood, a.k.a.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:90%
10,000 years ago.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So finding a 7,000-year-old city
in this location reveals how

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.130 align:middle line:90%
ancient the site truly is.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It is very likely that the
city was found 400 meters away

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:90%
from Seti I's temple.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It probably belonged to the
Shemsis, Osiris followers,

watching angels in the Bible.

in this subterranean
Osireion temple

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:90%

>> This temple has been built
as the point of connection.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:10%
What people in
Atlantean times did

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:10%
was to use water as a way
of bringing information.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:10%
So they would storage
information in the water.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And in that way, they would
also transmit the information

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
through the blood by the bath,
like many other cultures did.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So this temple was about to put
heaven and Earth both together

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle line:84%
in the blood of
people so they could

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
have the information of both
parts of the reality as one.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as
the pyramids, the way

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
of building it was to bring the
stones from far away buy sound.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:90%
The technology was the sound.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So all the structure
was about how

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
to bring the information of
the cosmos into the blood,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
into the cells by
vibration, by sound.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is why this is the
first place in history where

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:90%

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:84%
welcoming nobles and commoners
in his aquatic temple.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Numerous Sumerian
and Akkadian seals

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.340 align:middle line:84%
show Enki in a
structure with columns

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:90%
and surrounded by water.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:10%
It is clear that it is
the Osireion temple.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, Enki and
Osiris are one in the same.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.860 align:middle line:84%
He was Enki, Lord of the
Earth to the Sumerians

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:90%
in Asar, his true Egyptian name.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And Osiris is the Greek
one to the Egyptians.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.690 align:middle line:84%
He lived for a long time
in the Osireion temple,

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:84%
where he welcomed his people
and preached the good word.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Both Enki in Sumer and Osiris in
Egypt were close to the people

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:90%
and taught them.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.440 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Enki in Sumer is the
famous biblical serpent.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Certain tablets refer
to him as the serpent.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:10%
An important element linked
to both Abydos and my theory

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:10%
that Enki is Osiris
is that Enki regularly

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:10%
lived in an aquatic
temple known as Abzu,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:10%
according to Sumerian texts.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
The site of Abydos is
pronounced Abdu in Egyptian,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:90%
which means the reliquary hill.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Why hill?

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We know there was a hill over
the Osireion temple on which

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
grew trees.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:90%
When does Enki become Osiris?

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The Sumerian tablets
mentioned Enki

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:84%
with Annungo, his
entourage, who will become

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
the Shemsis in Egypt and the
Anunna, Enlil's followers

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:90%
or sets in Egypt.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:90%
At first, Enki is very present.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Many tablets explain that he
came to Earth with the gods

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and that he settles in
the Kharsag Mountains

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and creates the
garden known as Eden.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:10%
But it is obvious in
the Sumerian texts

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:10%
that Enki does not get
along with the Anunna.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Enki eventually
leaves the Anunna clan

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and goes to live in
the Atlantean Islands

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and in Egypt, which is
where he settles and creates

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:90%
his site at Abydos.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.485 align:middle line:84%
This is where he officially
becomes Asar, or Osiris.

00:12:47.485 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:90%


00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Osiris was one of the main
gods of Egyptian culture,

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
related, of course,
to the main trinity,

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:90%
which was with Isis and Horus.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the history of
them is something

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that is more related
with the first pharaohs

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and the first lineage of the
kings and queens of this land

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and how they
started to resurrect

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:90%
by mummification and so on.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of the god of the
afterlife of the mummification.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:10%
But that's the Egyptian
point of view of history.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:10%
But its history comes way
before and way beyond in time,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:10%
and it's more related with
the families of Atlantis

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:52.850 align:middle line:10%
that came to this land around
12,000 to 11,000 years ago.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So during that period of time
when the civilization ended,

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:90%
they came here.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
first families that

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.220 align:middle line:84%
came to make the
settlements here

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
was the family of Osiris, which
of course, was not his name.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So there appears to be
a link between the Osireion

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.600 align:middle line:90%
and the cult of Enki in Sumeria.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And this comes from the
fact that the main temple

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
of Enki at Eridu, in what
is today southern Iran,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
involved the creation
of a structure

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:84%
where the waters
of the Euphrates

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
would come in and flood the
lower levels exactly the same

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:90%
as the Osireion at Abydos.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And although we know that the
Osireion quite clearly was

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
associated with
the cult of Osiris,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and what was going on in Sumeria
was connected with the god

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Enki, we have to ask ourselves
whether there is a relationship

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:90%
between these two gods.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Sumerian Enki
actually be the same person

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.730 align:middle line:90%
referred to in Egypt as Osiris?

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
If this is so, could he have
lived on the Atlantean Islands

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and then colonized a
settlement in Egypt

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:90%
referred to now as Abydos?

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:10%
Experts point to
a famous road that

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:10%
could have been where
the followers of Osiris

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:10%
traveled from the coast
of Africa to Abydos.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:90%

Herodotus set out to
map the route taken

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
by Osiris's followers after the
flood which destroyed Atlantis.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians were very familiar
with the story of Atlantis

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.160 align:middle line:84%
as it is told in great detail on
the walls of the Edfu temples.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
He went from the
Pillars of Hercules

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to Mount Atlas, then mapped
out the route known today

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:84%
as the Path of the
Dead to Libyan desert,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:84%
to Thebes and Abydos,
and probably Dendera.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.320 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
to see that Herodotus

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
was able to recreate
this route which

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
contemporary archaeologists
are quite familiar with,

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
since there are traces
throughout the Libyan desert

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.195 align:middle line:84%
of this road that has
since become a trade route.

00:16:29.195 --> 00:16:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Atlantis was a civilization
settled all around the islands

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
in the Atlantic Ocean, around
the islands of Green Cape,

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:90%
of Canary Islands, and Azores.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:84%
The Canary Islands were of
the most important place

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.700 align:middle line:84%
through where they started
to spread around the world.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:84%
And they took different
path to get to the Nile,

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:90%
because the Nile was their goal.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And from the Canary
Islands is where

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
they took the path
to something that we

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.460 align:middle line:90%
called at that time Taggok.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And Taggok was what
we call now Iberia.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And they had the white
pass and the black pass,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and the white pass
was the northern

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and the black path
was the southern.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
That is Morocco today,
all the Atlas Mountains.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And through the South, they
went through the fertile valleys

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.480 align:middle line:90%
in all the Sahara.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:84%
In that time there was no
Sahara as we know it today.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.280 align:middle line:90%
There was more green regions.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
So they crossed all
through that region

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
until they reached by the
north the delta of the Nile,

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and by the South, they reached
the center of the Nile,

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:90%

>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.710 align:middle line:84%

southern part of Atlantis was

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:84%
in the Canary Islands and
extended north to the Azores

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Islands.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was disrupted
several times.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
There were numerous floods, as
mentioned in the Edfu texts.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Atlanteans regularly
faced major problems

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.685 align:middle line:84%
and were constantly
forced to rebuild.

00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:48.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
In my view, the southern
part corresponds

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to the Canary Islands which
comes from the Latin Canariae

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Insulae, the Island of
Dogs, not because dogs

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
were rampant on the island
when it was discovered,

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:84%
but because ancient legends tell
of humans with dog heads living

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Again, we find the idea
that Osiris's followers,

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.345 align:middle line:84%
the Shemsis, were present in
the southern part of Atlantis.

00:19:14.345 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.150 align:middle line:84%

the foremost of Westerners,
who has a wolf head.

to bring Western culture,

Atlantis, to Egypt.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Anubis also has a
wolf head and happens

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.220 align:middle line:90%
to be one of Osiris's sons.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.110 align:middle line:84%
After his father's death, he
becomes a kind of funerary God.

Osiris through his wolf head.

the sister of Osiris,

and Osiris was the
main god of Abydos.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So there was a relationship
between these two cult centers,

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
one associated with Isis,
and the other associated

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.005 align:middle line:90%

ancient centers of worship

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:90%
of the God Osiris.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Osiris was the god of
the dead, the dead god

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that the pharaoh became
in death, obviously.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:10%
But it was more than this,
because before even Osiris was

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:10%
associated with Abydos,
it was the place

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:10%
of the cult of another God by
the name of Khenti-Amentiu.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And this was a dog in a canine
form, most obviously a jackal.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And this jackal was seen
to be the guide of the soul

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:84%
as it journeyed through the
underworld into the afterlife.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
Khenti-Amentiu became

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:40.450 align:middle line:90%
a part of the cult of Osiris.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Once you have passed through
the magnificent temple

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:84%
of Seti I at Abydos, you come
out into an open courtyard.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you then
look down, you see

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:56.290 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
underground structure,

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and it is made of
massive cyclopian blocks.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are huge blocks
that almost look as if they've

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.480 align:middle line:90%
been put in place by giants.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.430 align:middle line:10%
And this forms a
rectilinear structure

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:10%
in the center of which is a
raised platform or island.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.930 align:middle line:10%
And this would have been
surrounded in the past

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:10%
by water that would have
flowed in from the Nile.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And within the island itself
is these massive pillars

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.455 align:middle line:84%
that had these lintels
on top of them.

00:24:35.455 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing was
covered over with a roof

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and quite clearly was used
for rituals and initiations,

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:50.020 align:middle line:84%
probably to do with the
cult of the god Osiris.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Why Osiris?

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, because according to
the most ancient versions

00:24:55.690 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:84%
of the story of his
death, he was buried

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.240 align:middle line:90%
on an island within a tomb.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what the
Osireion represents

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.040 align:middle line:84%
is a symbolic tomb
of the god Osiris.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And the rituals to do
with the cult of Osiris

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:84%
would have been conducted at
this location right the way

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.120 align:middle line:90%
through Dynastic times.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:90%

here for many years?

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of Osiris is
a very fascinating one,

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and it tells of the betrayal
of this God by his brother Set

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
or Seth, who is
the trickster God.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was said that
he tricked Osiris

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:84%
into a tailor-made coffin which
was then nailed down and thrown

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.730 align:middle line:90%
into the River Nile.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
this killed Osiris.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But his sister and wife, Isis,
came along, found the body,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and was able to
resurrect the god.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But then Set himself
found the body once again

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and chopped it up into
14 parts, and those parts

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle line:84%
were sprinkled throughout
the whole of Egypt.

something mysterious

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:90%
has been hidden in this story--

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.640 align:middle line:84%
something that took
place at Abydos.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Experts point to a mystical
system which holds the key.

system of being able to break

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.820 align:middle line:90%
a specific numerical value.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And when these values
are brought together,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.630 align:middle line:84%
it creates a total,

has a mystical significance.

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem as if this
is something which was also

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
found in Greek tradition
as well and became

Islands and the planet

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.610 align:middle line:90%
the father was bound.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Once more, we encounter
the idea of Osiris being

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:57.170 align:middle line:90%
attached to a tree at Abydos.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:10%
As I mentioned earlier, the
Sumerian tablet B.M 100,046

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:06.350 align:middle line:10%
speaks of the son of life
being attached to a tree

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:10.190 align:middle line:10%
and sacrificed by a cruel demon.

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:84%
His body is recovered
by his two sisters

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and is resurrected thanks to
Ereshkigal, the queen of Kigal,

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.890 align:middle line:90%
the underground beneath Giza.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Osiris died at
Abydos because that

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.070 align:middle line:90%
was where he lived and taught.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It is symbolic because it
is the place where he taught

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.010 align:middle line:90%
humanity the secrets of tools.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:38.740 align:middle line:10%
This idea can also be found
in tablet B.M. 100,046, where

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.870 align:middle line:10%
it is said that
the son of life was

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:10%
criticized for
teaching the people

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.590 align:middle line:10%
about the tree of knowledge.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:49.870 align:middle line:90%


00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> If Osiris/Enki died here
at this ancient site of Abydos

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:59.320 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years ago crucified,
could it be that this message

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:90%
was a turning point in humanity?

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> [SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The death of Osiris around
10,000 BC represents a turning

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.760 align:middle line:90%
point in history.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.120 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian funerary texts
that speak of his death

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.760 align:middle line:90%
date back to 2500 BC.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.450 align:middle line:84%
The time lag between his death
and the texts that speak of it

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.960 align:middle line:90%
is at least 8,000 years.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:84%
This was a civilizing God
who, similar to Jesus Christ,

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.310 align:middle line:84%
offered teachings and was
massacred because his message

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.020 align:middle line:90%
was disliked.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.810 align:middle line:84%
His message has lived
on over millennia.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Abydos was a landmark
for millennia.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.360 align:middle line:84%
People from the Near East, Far
East, and the Mediterranean

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.550 align:middle line:84%
came to mourn his
passing at his tomb.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.620 align:middle line:90%
This went on for a millennia.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It's unfathomable.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult
for us to imagine,

00:32:55.810 --> 00:33:00.250 align:middle line:84%
because our reference point is
Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.640 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about 8,000
or 10,000 years ago here.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.440 align:middle line:90%
It's monumental.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:84%
His message has lived on and can
still be found in texts today.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:13.940 align:middle line:90%


00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.310 align:middle line:84%
We find the same story
in different myths,

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.930 align:middle line:84%
be they Sumerian, Akkadian,
Egyptian, or African.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Traces of Osiris echo in Dogon
mythology with the sacrifice

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:90%
of Nommo on a tree.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.590 align:middle line:10%
The evil coyote, Pale Fox,
who is determined to kill him

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:10%
represents Set, or Enlil.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.470 align:middle line:10%
The story is archetypical
and cyclical.

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Following Osiris's death, the
chronicles of Horus begin.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.090 align:middle line:84%
He is said to be the
reincarnation of Osiris.

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.170 align:middle line:10%
The texts explain that Isis
extracted Osiris's genes

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:10%
and gave birth to Horus.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.840 align:middle line:84%
He followed a similar
trajectory as his father,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.880 align:middle line:84%
although he was much
more of a warrior

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and set out to
battle Set's forces.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:84%
It is an archetypical story,
including that of Jesus,

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:84%
that repeats itself until
the message is heard.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.639 align:middle line:84%
Is humanity capable
of receiving it?

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:13.920 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.290 align:middle line:10%
>> So why exactly is the
death of Osiris and the legend

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.060 align:middle line:10%
surrounding it so important--

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.219 align:middle line:10%
so important to us, but also
important to the Dynastic

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:26.449 align:middle line:10%
Egyptians?

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.550 align:middle line:10%
And the answer
appears to be simple.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:33.650 align:middle line:10%
It's about the whole concept
of death and resurrection,

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:39.770 align:middle line:10%
not just of us human
beings, but of nature

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:44.460 align:middle line:10%
and of the cycles of
the sun each year.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:49.380 align:middle line:10%
All of these were these
death and rebirth gods

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:10%
that would hammer
home this whole idea

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:10%
of the importance of
death and the resurrection

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.650 align:middle line:10%
in the afterlife.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that also
brings us to Christianity.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:84%
We have similar ideas
with the death of Jesus

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and his resurrection
after three days,

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:84%
because very clearly, the whole
early cult of Christianity

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:84%
borrowed a lot of its ideas
from pre-existing pagan gods who

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:24.000 align:middle line:84%
existed in the area
of the Near East

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.300 align:middle line:90%
prior to the first century AD.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of these just
tell us how important

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:33.900 align:middle line:84%
it is that when we die,
we will be resurrected.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:38.200 align:middle line:90%


00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of Enki and Osiris
and possibly even Jesus is

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:46.780 align:middle line:84%
of a great man that teaches
humans how to understand

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:84%
the universe and their
connections with God.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible these teachings
keep coming to us until we

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:57.430 align:middle line:90%
understand their true meaning?

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.960 align:middle line:90%


00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.770 align:middle line:10%
>> We have to understand
something about ourselves that

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:10%
pushes the boundaries of
our limits and allows us

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.260 align:middle line:10%
to understand what
we're being shown.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Osiris may represent
that from a time

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:90%
that predates Christianity.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.840 align:middle line:84%
My sense is from
my Egyptian guides,

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
from the Bedouins
that I've worked with

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and their mystical traditions,
from the stories that

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.510 align:middle line:84%
were handed down
from father to son

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.600 align:middle line:84%
in the lineage of
the Egyptian guides

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%
is that the Osireion is the
hall of records, if you will,

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:90%
for the Osireion wisdom.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.135 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
information is stored.

00:36:41.135 --> 00:36:44.570 align:middle line:90%


00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.860 align:middle line:10%

experiences of the universe,

the process of acknowledging,
the process of living,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.230 align:middle line:10%
of learning about life.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:10%
And this was the idea
that the Atlantean people

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:06.260 align:middle line:10%
had about the representative
of the families in the culture,

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.630 align:middle line:10%
that humans were
trying to represent

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:10.230 align:middle line:10%
the concept of the universe.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that he and
the other ones were gods,

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.190 align:middle line:84%
but they were people
that were trying

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate the
concept of the cosmos

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.910 align:middle line:84%
so they could teach others
how the cosmos works.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:28.154 align:middle line:84%
So he was the representation of
the experience of the universe.

superhumans, and gods.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.750 align:middle line:84%

for the freedom of humanity.
