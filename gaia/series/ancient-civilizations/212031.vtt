00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:10%
>> In the heart of ancient
Indonesia is the island known

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.030 align:middle line:10%
as Sulawesi.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:10%
Scattered throughout
the rugged valleys

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:10%
of this pre-diluvian mountaintop
are the megalithic relics

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.510 align:middle line:10%
that inspire many questions
about the power and influence

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.720 align:middle line:10%
of this legendary land.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Was this massive island
a region of the Mu Empire

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that was inhabiting
the entire Pacific

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Rim roughly 50,000 years ago.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:10%
As alternative researchers
explore this misunderstood

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.900 align:middle line:10%
land and the emblematic links
to other pre-diluvian sites

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:10%
around the planet, the question
remains, who left these relics

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:10%
and what are they
trying to tell us?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Sulawesi is a very
interesting place.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
This was the old area
of Sunda, or Sundaland,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:90%
as it was known in the past.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Sundaland was actually
joined on to Southeast Asia

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.830 align:middle line:90%
in the area of Malaysia.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:10%
But at the end of the last
ice age, around 9,600 BC,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:10%
a lot of the more coastal
regions sank, leaving Java

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:10%
and many of the other
islands isolated in the way

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:10%
that you see today.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But Sulawesi is
beyond that even,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and there is a huge ocean trench
between Java and Sulawesi,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:84%
which means that the only
way you can get to it

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is through seafaring, and
this has been the case

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:90%
for tens of thousands of years.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most mysterious
islands you'll ever come across

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is the 11th biggest
island on the planet.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:90%
It's Sulawesi.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:10%
It has an incredible
story and traditions

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.530 align:middle line:10%
which you don't
often get to hear

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.510 align:middle line:10%
about them because the people
are very sort of enclosed.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.710 align:middle line:10%
They keep themselves
to themselves.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.440 align:middle line:10%
It's usually involves
strange languages

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:10%
which never get translated
into French, English,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:10%
or anything that
resembles a language

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:10%
in the Western world
where academics

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.020 align:middle line:10%
are able to follow up.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:10%
That said, the stories
eventually leaked out,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:10%
and by 1908, a group
of anthropologists

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:10%
did go to the Central
Valley in Sulawesi,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:10%
which is the Bada Valley,
and they found monuments

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:10%
scattered all over the place.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But the most mysterious ones are
these sort of standing stones.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The largest of these
megaliths in Sulawesi is known

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:84%
as Watu Pelindo, and
it means the "wise man"

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:90%
or the "entertainer."

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.940 align:middle line:10%
But truly, the translation
of that is actually

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:10%
somewhat unknown, as well
as the purpose of the stone

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:10%
is unknown as well.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:10%
But what's so important
about Watu Pelindo

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:10%
is the depiction of the
hands around the navel

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:10%
of the body and the
way that it looks

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.220 align:middle line:10%
incredibly similar to other
pre-diluvian megaliths

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:10%
around the world.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most interesting
statues is the Pelindo statue.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is 15 feet tall.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
largest on the island.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And this faces west.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So people have suggested
this may be something

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
to do with death, possibly
resurrection as well because

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of the west-facing nature
of it, where traditionally

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.060 align:middle line:90%
that's the sunset.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
That's where the soul goes after
death and things like this.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:10%
It leans over to one
side now, but it would

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:10%
have been upright originally.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:10%
And this is just one of
many we find on the island.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:10%
There's 30 humanoid
statues like this.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have what appear
to be really elongated skulls.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
thought to be female,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
like goddess statues that have
necklaces and bracelets on

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and other such things.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people say they are
directly related to fertility,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.180 align:middle line:84%
but they also relate to people
being turned to stone for doing

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
bad deeds, like
murder or theft or

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:90%
different criminal activities.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So there's some moral
implication about don't do bad,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
or you'll get turned into
one of these statues.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And so these statues
are very, very powerful,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:90%
whoever placed them there.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The faces on all of
them are almost identical.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And these heads
are very strange.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:90%
They're very round.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.560 align:middle line:84%
They have noses that
almost look like a sort

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:90%
of medieval knight's nose guard.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And they have these strange,
circular, beady eyes,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and a line that goes round
that forms the chin but often

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:90%
without a mouth.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And these can be anything up to
15 feet in height, often made

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:90%
of extremely hard rock.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of them are fascinating,
and they have these almost

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
circular plectrum-shaped
heads, some of them.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they're carved out
in a really abstract manner,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and they have arms coming down
the sides with hands carved

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
in relief, either touching the
navel or just below the navel,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
or they're actually just about
touching the phallus so there's

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
fertility elements designed
into these statues.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.070 align:middle line:10%
>> When we isolate the hand
gestures that they're making,

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:10%
they're very extraordinary,
and they're very definitely

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:10%
pointing to something
to do with fertility,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:10%
with the connection
to the earth,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:10%
and also ultimately
with sexual energy,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps they're
drawing that energy up out

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:10%
of the earth, and this is
something that takes us back

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:10%
to the connection to Mu.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.580 align:middle line:84%
It's very earth-connected,
and it's all about the body

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And so these statues
could be just

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
telling us something
very important

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
about either fertility rituals,
times for fertility rituals,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
or just something about the
energy of the human body.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The incredible thing that
you find about these stories is

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
that these images of these
stones fulfill several

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.180 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We now know that all of
these standing stones,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:84%
no matter where they
are in the world,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:84%
they always have been
erected at the crossing paths

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.120 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth's
telluric currents.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So those are the Earth's
electromagnetic pathways

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So wherever they cross,
a standing stone appears.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And they added an extra
layer of information

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
here because these
stones were found also

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
because of their nature in
terms of the granitic nature

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
of the stone, the quartz,
and the metal in the stone

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:84%
that they actually amplify
the energy upon which

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:90%
they're standing.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So this leads us to
the understanding

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:84%
that the reason why they also
have their hands on their belly

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that they are
described as navel stones.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a navel or a
place where the Earth acts

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
as a navel from which
everything grows.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that
when you basically

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:84%
take electromagnetic energy,
and you compound it over time,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and you correlate it
within a specific area,

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
it has a fertilizing effect on
the plants around the vicinity.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
So they have a fertilizing
quality about them,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
which brings us of course, to
the phallus between the hands.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
These hands are also
holding the phallus

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:84%
because it mimics the
fertilizing quality the stone

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
is producing around it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Throughout the
course of history,

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:10%
humanity has used stones for
their energetic properties.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.940 align:middle line:10%
Granite is believed to be
the oldest volcanic rock

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:10%
in the world and is one of the
hardest stones on the planet.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
This powerful stone can be
found in ancient sites in Egypt,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:84%
such as the Osirion
temple at Abydos

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and the King's Chamber
of the Great Pyramid.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.550 align:middle line:84%
The giant blocks that
were used in these sites

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:84%
are believed to have been
transported hundreds of miles

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.890 align:middle line:90%
from a quarry in Aswan.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Could the energetic
power of granite

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
be a link to the presence
of ancient knowledge

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:84%
on the island of Sulawesi
before the cataclysms

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:90%
of the Younger Dryas period?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.539 align:middle line:10%
>> Researchers are confused as
to where the stones to make up

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:45.520 align:middle line:10%
these megaliths came from.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:10%
Granite is not a stone
indigenous to Sulawesi.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Sulawesi was connected
to Australia as well as

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:90%
New Guinea via a land bridge.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So these stones could
have come from anywhere

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
in that territory
that went underwater

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:90%
some 12,000 years ago.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This is granite
we're carving here.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not just soft limestone
or anything like that.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So did it come from
another island?

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.390 align:middle line:90%
Was it transported over?

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Was there granite outcrops there
tens of thousands of years ago

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:84%
we don't know about
that sunk under the sea?

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:90%
Also, there's no chisel marks.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:84%
There's no tooling marks
on any of the stones

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:90%
that are clearly visible.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:84%
There has been slight
weathering on it as well, so

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:90%
that might have removed them.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
of any tools,

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and there's no evidence
of who did them.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
of a high culture

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.090 align:middle line:84%
on this island at the time they
were supposed to be created.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Even the locals, they say
they've always been there.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:90%
They've been there.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
When their first ancestors were
there, they were already there.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're going back potentially
thousands and thousands

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Most academics are honest in
that they don't know who made

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:90%
them or how old they are.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.250 align:middle line:10%
They are made of a very
hard granitic stone, which

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.480 align:middle line:10%
would require very hard
steel tools if not even

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:10%
diamond technology
to be able to shape,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:10%
because they are
quite intricate.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> When talking to mainstream
archaeologists about this site,

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:26.110 align:middle line:84%
the curator of the History of
Sulawesi admitted that they

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:84%
didn't know both how old these
statues were or who created

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So when we're looking at
historical basis of this area,

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.440 align:middle line:90%
it's currently a mystery.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We find these megaliths on
Sulawesi strewn about all over

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:90%
the place.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Some have fallen.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Some are still standing.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:10%
Some have been damaged
in a way which almost

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:10%
seems difficult to understand.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that
they are the remnants

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:84%
of a cataclysm that befell
Sundaland as the place of Mu

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:03.190 align:middle line:84%
in the distant past either at
the time of the Younger Dryas

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.050 align:middle line:90%
or even perhaps even earlier?

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Unlike Stonehenge or other
places where they're all

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:84%
in complete order and more or
less the original positioning,

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.678 align:middle line:84%
these stones are
all over the place.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:10%
There's thrown over there,
one thrown over there,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:10%
it's very randomized.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:10%
And I can see how it would
look like that they were thrown

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.580 align:middle line:10%
about in a catastrophe, and
this is the devastation effect

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:10%
of what's happened.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So were they there
before the catastrophe?

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a theory that
they're extremely ancient

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:10%
because some of
them look very old.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:84%
They have extreme
weathering on them.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have
been knocked around.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:84%
They're in random locations,
it seems, over quite

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:90%
a great distance, actually.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And so did something
knock them around?

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Was there some
kind of cataclysm?

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Can it even go back to
the Younger Dryas era?

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at these sites
and we see the destruction,

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:10%
where they are
broken into pieces,

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:10%
strewn across the
land haphazardly,

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:10%
what it tells us is that
something happened so quickly,

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:10%
with such force,
in such a powerful,

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:10%
powerful way that this is not a
process that occurred gradually

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:10%
over a long period of time.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:90%
It was an event that happened.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And the dating suggests
the event is directly

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:84%
linked to the cataclysms
that have created so many

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:90%
of the mysteries of our past.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>> As the debate continues
around the purpose and origin

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
of these strange
megalithic statues,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
there is an even deeper mystery
on the island of Sulawesi that

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:90%
baffles alternative researchers.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.270 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to
the Watu figures,

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:90%
we find a number of giant pots.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:10%
Many of them have one
giant hole carved in them

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:10%
while some of them have
two chambers inside,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.660 align:middle line:10%
and local residents
assumed that they

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.810 align:middle line:10%
were baths for the nobility.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most interesting
archaeological discoveries is

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:10%
these giant cauldrons
or stone bowls.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:90%
No one knows who made them.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
No one knows where
they came from.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
No one even knows where
the stone came from,

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:84%
because it's a certain
type of granite that

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.020 align:middle line:90%
isn't found in the area.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And the carvings are immaculate.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:84%
They're precision-engineered,
made by the most outstanding

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:90%
artisans.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:10%
They could be a few
thousand years old.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.880 align:middle line:10%
They could be tens of
thousands of years old.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:84%
No one actually knows
who created them.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And these can be
anything up to about six,

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
seven feet in height, and
they're hollowed out inside,

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:90%
but they have these two areas.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:10%
In other words,
there's like a wall,

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.030 align:middle line:10%
and there's like two
areas inside them.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And they are only cut
quite shallow inside.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you're trying
to understand what's

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.750 align:middle line:84%
going on here, it becomes
really difficult very quickly

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:84%
to try and comprehend this
in terms of anything else

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.067 align:middle line:84%
that you might see in any
other part of the world.

00:14:14.067 --> 00:14:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't just mean in
this part of the world.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean anywhere in the world.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And you look at these, and
you are looking at evidence

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%
of a lost culture here.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
about that at all.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Where did the idea come
for making these massive jars?

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:10%
We see some of them
toppled over these days,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:10%
and it's interesting to note in
symbolism worldwide that cups

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:10%
represent the feminine and
that you have the masculine

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:10%
there as well.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:10%
So I think the symbolism is
about yin and yang, masculine

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:10%
and feminine as well.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
ask yourself, well,

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:84%
what were these used for,
these massive jar-like objects?

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And some myths say that
they were baths for kings.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was 419 found, and
some of them had lids as well,

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and there was only
219 lids found.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.280 align:middle line:10%
So not all of them had
lids, and how were you

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.510 align:middle line:10%
going to ever lift up these lids
to put on the top of the jar

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:10%
anyway?

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:90%
And how were they transported?

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Questions arise.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It really does
through this island

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:90%
that hardly anybody knows about.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Mainstream science dates
these megaliths to roughly

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:90%
2,000 to 5,000 years old.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But is there a deeper
connection between

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.970 align:middle line:84%
these mysterious granite wonders
and the pre-diluvian clues

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:90%
found around the planet?

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There are more influences
that seem to be apparent here

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:84%
when looking at these
statues from Sulawesi.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:59.390 align:middle line:84%
We have the statues from
Tiwanaku and Pumapunku

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:90%
in Bolivia.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
We have similar
style, similar design.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, could we connect this with
the ancient lost land of Mu?

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Certainly we're finding very
similar styles in these vastly

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
different locations
all across the planet,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.600 align:middle line:84%
and there has to be some
explanation for this.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.270 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
a sacred tradition

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.170 align:middle line:84%
being passed around by these
navigators, these sailors

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
moving around these
different areas

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:84%
many, many thousands
of years ago.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The sophistication
seen in Sulawesi,

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Indonesia is without a doubt
pre-diluvian based on how

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
incredibly precise some of
these giant megaliths are.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:84%
We find similarities to other
pre-diluvian civilizations

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not you want to
look at the Moai of Easter

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Island and the clasped
hands around their lower

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
belly for fertility all the
way across to the Urfa man

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
found in Turkey, which shows the
same clasped hands, what this

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.990 align:middle line:84%
tells us is that the
depictions of fertility

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.839 align:middle line:84%
and the types of construction
and the types of information

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:84%
we have for creating these
Bada Valley monoliths

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:84%
was shared with these other
civilizations around the world.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The megaliths on
Sulawesi are unique.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
And what we mean by that is
that you cannot look towards any

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:84%
other contemporary culture
in the Pacific and say, look,

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
that's where it came from, or
that's where the predecessors

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that created those megaliths
may have come from.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know is that
the same style of carving stone

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:45.660 align:middle line:84%
was in use as early as 9,500
BC at places like Gobekli

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Tepe in Southeastern Turkey.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:90%
For instance, Urfa man.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:00.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Urfa man is this incredible
statue of a person from Gobekli

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:10%
Tepe times about
12,000 years ago.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:10%
And he's incredibly
sophisticated.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:84%
He's not some kind
of caveman that

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.180 align:middle line:90%
looks all crude and scruffy.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:90%
These were sophisticated people.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We have other statues have
been discovered in places like

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Karahan Tepe.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's a panel
that's been discovered

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:90%
at a site called Sayburc.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:10%
And the same thing
is depicted there,

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:10%
with the hands coming down the
side and touching the navel.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Now Gobekli Tepe itself means
Potbelly Hill or Navel Hill.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:10%
And so the actual name of
it is relating to this,

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:10%
what the hands are pointing to.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:90%
The same thing on Easter Island.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Easter Island is known as the
navel of the world in Rapa Nui

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Sulawesi is
really interesting.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Instantly I went, oh my God.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:90%
That looks like the Moai.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Or that looks like
the Urfa man statue.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
That looks like things
in South America.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:84%
The placement of the hands being
so particularly at the sides,

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
they chose to do the
hands in a certain way

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.873 align:middle line:84%
in very different
corners of the world,

00:19:13.873 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:90%
so that struck me instantly.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I feel like
I've seen this before.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible that there
is another commonality between

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Gobekli Tepe and Sulawesi?

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:10%
Some of these lids of these
weird, huge stone jars,

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:10%
there are animals on them that
are carved in 3D relief that

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:10%
match almost exactly
what they call

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:10%
porthole windows at Gobekli Tepe
in South Turkey that we know

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:10%
are 11,500 years old.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
The similarity in the style
that they've been created

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:90%
is virtually identical.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So why is it, then, that we
see this particular style

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.910 align:middle line:84%
at Sulawesi and also at Gobekli
Tepe in Southeast Turkey

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that shows that we are
dealing with the descendants

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of some kind of original
culture or civilization

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that existed in
the distant past?

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're not saying therefore
that the Gobekli Tepe

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:90%
people made them necessarily.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:84%
What we are saying is that the
ancients of 11,500 years ago

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to create
carvings like this.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's no reason
why we should not

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
look towards this distant
epoch for the creators,

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the manufacturers
of these megaliths.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:58.165 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a lot of evidence,
whether it's Indonesia or Rapa

00:20:58.165 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Nui, or parts of South
America, that, yes,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:84%
there is the same pattern of an
earlier cycle of civilization

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:84%
sophistication before the
end of the last ice age.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not as well developed as
we have for Gobekli Tepe, which

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.970 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely definitive,
or for the Great Sphinx,

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:90%
but we have to keep looking.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.510 align:middle line:90%
We have to keep searching.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep, I believe,
an open mind to it.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:10%
>> If there was an ancient
civilization on Sulawesi that

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:10%
shared celestial and
architectural knowledge with

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:10%
other pre-diluvian
civilizations around the planet,

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:10%
who was this advanced culture,
and when did they inhabit this

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.370 align:middle line:10%
land?

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:51.860 align:middle line:84%
As the mystery continues,
a discovery on Sulawesi

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:84%
may be the link that connects
this mysterious island

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:90%
to the legendary Mu Empire.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other things
that may push that date back

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:84%
of these stone statues in the
Bada Valley of Sulawesi is

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.650 align:middle line:84%
the fact that on the very
Southern part of the island

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:17.660 align:middle line:84%
in a cave they found a 45,000
year old carving of a wild pig.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the case,
if they're creating

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:84%
this artwork in these caves
at this extremely early date,

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.070 align:middle line:90%
we know humans were there then.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So could these statues
go back to that era?

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:10%
We know that on Sumatra and
some other Indonesian islands

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.290 align:middle line:10%
some very early stonework
and carvings and petroglyphs

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:10%
have also been found.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:10%
And obviously not too far from
there, on the Java mainland,

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.060 align:middle line:10%
we have Gunung Padang, which
some researchers suggest

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:10%
is 20,000 years old.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So all the dates of all
these other discoveries

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:56.760 align:middle line:84%
could date the statues in
the Bada Valley of Sulawesi.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that there's evidence
of activity on Sulawesi going

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:84%
back at least 100,000
to 120,000 years ago.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Stone tools have been found
that date to this early period.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Plus, we have the earliest
evidence of cave art

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.130 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the world.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.640 align:middle line:10%
And the stone tools that
have been found on Sulawesi

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:10%
are similar to
those that have been

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:10%
found on the mainland
that have been attributed

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:10%
to the Denisovans.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:10%
That's this distant
cousin of humanity

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:10%
that existed down to about
30,000 to 40,000 years ago.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.270 align:middle line:10%
So in other words,
there's every reason

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.200 align:middle line:10%
to suggest that they could
have reached Sulawesi by boat.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they had
maritime capabilities

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and created not just the stone
tools, but also the cave art,

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
but also therefore
there's every possibility

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that either the Denisovans
or Denisovan human hybrids

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.480 align:middle line:84%
who came after them were
responsible for creating

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.000 align:middle line:90%
those megaliths.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that
the megaliths on Sulawesi

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.100 align:middle line:84%
are actual evidence
of the peoples of Mu?

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What other secrets does
this mysterious island hold

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to connect this pre-diluvian
land to a time long before

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.555 align:middle line:84%
the catastrophes of the Younger
Dryas scattered and buried

00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:32.355 align:middle line:90%
the relics?

00:24:32.355 --> 00:24:34.900 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Will the location of an ancient
granite quarry be discovered?

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And what other evidence
is now underwater along

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:84%
the coastline of this
massive island that

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:84%
will alter the
mainstream timeline

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:90%
for the rise of civilization?

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:06.000 align:middle line:90%
