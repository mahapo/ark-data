regarding ancient humanity's
connection to the feline.

Who did these wise
feline deities represent?

What are the cosmic connections?

Legends tell of a time when
the Great Sphinx of Giza

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:90%
was a full lion.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But the evidence of who and
when our ancestors carved this

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
into the bedrock remains one
of humanity's greatest debates.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:84%
As alternative researchers
search for more relics,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.770 align:middle line:84%
the evidence is mounting
that the feline had

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous power and presence
in many of Earth's highly

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.525 align:middle line:90%
advanced ancient civilizations.

texts and traditions have

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:10%
revered the power of the feline
throughout history in ways that

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:10%
reach into our world even today.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up in
unexpected ways.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:84%
We see, for example, 40,000
years ago in Northern Europe,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
we see the first images, cave
paintings of lions on the cave

Of all the animals
that were present

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
during that time, why
did our ancestors choose

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.180 align:middle line:90%
to portray those lions?

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.212 align:middle line:90%
What did it mean to them?

00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the oldest statues

character with the
head of a lion.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
between 20,000 and
30,000 years ago.

just how ancient

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.550 align:middle line:84%
this relationship,
this connection

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
is between felines

the image of the Sphinx.

When people think of
the Sphinx, of course,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
they're thinking of
the Sphinx at Egypt

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:84%
in its present form that's
half human, half feline.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to ancient
Sumeria, where we also

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.940 align:middle line:84%
find the god Nergal is
half human, half lion.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
He also is a figure that's
given ferocious capacities.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.160 align:middle line:84%
He's a warrior type, but
he also has the ability

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.070 align:middle line:90%
to cross through gateways.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
important aspect

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx
imagery and mythology

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.800 align:middle line:90%
that we find around the world.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx is considered
the guardian of gateways

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.675 align:middle line:84%
into palaces, into temples, but
also into other realms as well.

archetype in ancient Egypt,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.020 align:middle line:84%
as well as in the final
phase of Atlantis.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It was a powerful symbol that
resonated deeply in society

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and was later carried through
Zep Tepi into ancient Egypt.

have the lions staying there

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
very regally at the front of
the entrance to the temple with

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:90%
the paw over this little ball.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.930 align:middle line:10%
And you look at the little
ball and it tells you

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:10%
everything you need to know
because that's a flower of life.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:10%
That's the matrix of the
creative code of civilization,

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:10%
of the universe, if you like.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:10%
It's the foundation of
everything there is.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And just by putting
the lion's paw on

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that tells you that that's
where the information originally

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:10%
It was someone associated with
that symbol, that female entity

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:10%
that came from somewhere else
that knew how life is created.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:10%
They knew about the
codes of life itself,

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:10%
and they formed the foundation
of human civilization.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So you're taking
a very old symbol

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and then putting it at the
entrance to the Forbidden City

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:84%
to give honor to a bunch
of kings and queens

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
who, by then, probably had
no connection to any of this.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.673 align:middle line:84%
But the memory of the
original story remains.

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's important.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the memory of
how we got there.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.712 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.712 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%

Babylon, Greece, the
Mycenaeans, for instance,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that you have
lions at the front of gates

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:90%
and entrances.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
this is because they

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.610 align:middle line:84%
represented this
point of contact

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:90%
between this world and the next.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.972 align:middle line:84%
They became the guardians of the
entrances into the other world.

>> In India, you find
these feline symbols,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.750 align:middle line:10%
feline statues all over India.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
But specifically, consider
these great spiritual temples,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.470 align:middle line:84%
spiritual site called
Chidambaram with its dancing

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:90%
Shiva.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And this place is filled
with these feline statues.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.310 align:middle line:90%
They are the guardians.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And the devotees will actually
worship these feline statues

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:84%
before entering the temple
because these are considered

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:84%
the protectors, but also
these are considered as agency

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.240 align:middle line:90%
to approach the Shiva.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So it is the agency
that intervenes

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
between the devotee
and the ultimate truth,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it,
or the ultimate energy.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you are
like requesting their help

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.440 align:middle line:84%
in the journey of the evolution
of your consciousness.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:10%
>> So regardless if we're
looking at leopards, lions,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:10%
or other big cats, the presence
of the feline is definitely

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:10%
recorded and revered by
these ancient people.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The feline connection
around the world is fascinating

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.460 align:middle line:84%
because wherever you
go around the world,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
you tend to see the images
of lions all over the place.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.465 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well, why
are lions are so important?

00:06:34.465 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well, where
does all this come from?

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to take it
back as far as I could

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:84%
because originally, everything
was connected to the stars.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
constellation of Leo

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
bright star Regulus,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
now you've got a story that
spans all around the world.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Everyone talks about this
because in India, the star

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:90%
Regulus is actually Magha.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And it means the exalted
one, the magnificent one.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's supposed to be
a sort of a royal star.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:84%
It's associated with a
kind of divine kingship.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But they say that particular
star forms a kind of gateway,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
that it's a place where high
knowledge or the mystery

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:90%
teachings originally came from.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So within the series
of the Zodiac,

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, you have
every constellation

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.860 align:middle line:90%
has its own specific function.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Regulus and Leo,
their function is

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to bring out information like
an astral reference library,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:90%
if you like.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.890 align:middle line:84%
That is a place that is defined
as a location where you're

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
going to get information
that dates back

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:84%
all the way to kingship,
when kingship was lowered

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
from the heavens to Earth, as
the Sumerians used to call it.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's that association
with divine kingship,

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:43.032 align:middle line:84%
which establishes the lion
as part of that symbology.

00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>> 10,450 BCE, Leo
was on the horizon.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.690 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly where
the Sphinx was looking.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.960 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx does have paws
and a body like a lion.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
theories about why

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:90%
this is being emphasized.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Another potential Sphinx
connection can be found deep

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.000 align:middle line:84%
in the heart of Romania,
where legends of giants

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and holographic technology
echo through the mountains.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The Dacians were the
ancient peoples of Romania.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:10%
And they took a
particular interest

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:10%
in the Carpathian
Mountains, the Carpathians

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:10%
being an incredibly enigmatic
and strange place, somewhere

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:10%
that is integrally associated
with mythology and legend.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It was believed that many of
the strange monuments that

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
could be found on the
top of the mountains

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
were said to be representations
of ancient creatures,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:90%
ancient supernatural forms.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And of these, probably the
most enigmatic and strange

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:90%
was that of the Sphinx.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It is considered to
be one of the seven

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.315 align:middle line:90%
ancient wonders of Romania.

00:09:10.315 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There is still, of course,
controversy about whether what

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:84%
we call the Sphinx is
an artificial structure

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:84%
or a natural formation as the
primary mineral is sandstone.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream science generally
views the Romanian Sphinx

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
as the result of
natural erosion.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
However, empirical
measurements suggest

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
a strong morphogenetic
field, which

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
would be unlikely to
exist with such intensity

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
if the formation
was natural, if it

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
was some sort of eroded
natural sandstone.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Any Sphinx, the
Carpathian, the Egyptian

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:84%
naturally emits a very strong
energy information field

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
that allows these
individual sphinxes

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
to be nonlocally energetically
connected through a network.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
design of the Sphinx.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.920 align:middle line:84%
It's what has been
implanted on a mental level

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
through the collective
consciousness of the initiates

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:90%
into the core of the Sphinx.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
But on a purely energetic level,
because of the strong energy

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
information field that
our ancestors imprinted

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
into the Sphinx with their
collective consciousness

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:90%
using their knowledge.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The sphinxes are connected
through a network, a matrix.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:10%
>> The mystique and the mystery
of the Carpathian Mountains has

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:10%
been growing since the release
of a book called Transylvanian

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:10%
Sunrise by Radu Cinamar.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:10%
In that book, he depicts a room
underneath the Carpathian Sphinx

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:10%
that has advanced holographic
technology, almost

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:10%
like a holographic
hall of records.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And he tells us that
stretching out from that room

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
are tunnels that lead to
Tibet, that lead to Egypt, even

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.072 align:middle line:90%
to the inner Earth.

00:10:58.072 --> 00:11:00.564 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:11:00.564 --> 00:11:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The first information
about the structure of these

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.890 align:middle line:84%
intercontinental tunnels
in the Budjak region,

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
along with many other
fascinating topics,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:90%
came to me in 2004.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Radu Cinamar or Cinamar, as his
name is sometimes pronounced,

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
has written eight
books that explore

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries of the
Budjak area as a whole,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:84%
comparing the information in his
publications with what I know.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
accuracy or truthfulness

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
or potency of his information
is around 75% to 80%.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.570 align:middle line:84%
In Radu Cinamar's
books, it's often

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:84%
mentioned that the creators of
the underground installation

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and its tunnels are
more or less unknown.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.170 align:middle line:84%
But I can say quite
confidently that the creators

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.970 align:middle line:90%
were the felines.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
The Carpathian Sphinx
as an archetype

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
is essentially the
personification of the felines.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It is a memorial, a
tribute to these mentors,

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:84%
these spiritual
cosmic mentors who

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
have had a very strong,
positive impact on our planet.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.396 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Southeast of Romania,
the mystery and prediluvian

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:10%
influence of ancient Turkey
continues to baffle mainstream

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:10%
and alternative researchers.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Recent discoveries from this
region have added further

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:84%
evidence of humanity's
connection with felines roughly

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:90%
12,000 years ago.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most important
animal totems found at places

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:84%
like Gobekli Tepe and Karahan
Tepe in Southeastern Turkey,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
sites that date back as
much as 11,500 years,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
is that you see the
feline everywhere.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
we are looking

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:90%
at a panther or a leopard.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> All over the site
since it's been excavated,

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:84%
which is only the
last few years,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
many depictions of
leopards have been found.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're not just talking
about simple carvings

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.300 align:middle line:84%
of leopards or
different felines.

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
We're actually talking about
3D statues of leopards.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And often, they're almost like
a shamanic with the leopard

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:90%
coming up over the top of it.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is really,
really compelling

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:84%
because it seems that
the leopard, which

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
we know was around at the time
of Karahan Tepe in that area,

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.720 align:middle line:84%
became like a kind
of shamanic symbol,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.095 align:middle line:84%
almost like a deity
of these people.

00:13:34.095 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The leopard would seem
to have been associated with

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:45.180 align:middle line:84%
the transformation of a human
into an animal form for shamanic

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:90%
purposes.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:10%
In other words, to enter into an
altered state of consciousness

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:10%
and to be able to travel within
an otherworldly environment.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the feline
became one of the most

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:90%
primordial psychopomps.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:10%
In other words, the spirit that
would accompany the human soul

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:13.206 align:middle line:10%
as it went from this
world into the next.

00:14:13.206 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient cultures were very
much obsessed with looking

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
at the landscape, looking at
nature and seeing how nature

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:84%
works and then transposing
nature in a way that you can

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
communicate the concept
to ordinary people who

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:90%
couldn't read or write.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's take the
Jaguars, for example.

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
You have this wonderful,
graceful creature

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:90%
that is somehow godly.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:10%
And the Sem priests in
Egypt looked at this

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:10%
and said, if we take
the actual jaguar skin

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:10%
and then drape it
around this, it gives us

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:10%
the symbol of office
that we are connected to,

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:10%
first of all, to the feline
tradition of knowledge

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:10%
from the gods and
also of royalty

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:10%
that's connected to a kind
of regal concept of where

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:10%
gods and humans interacted.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:10%
So it's a badge of office.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
One corner of the
knowledge was all to do

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.647 align:middle line:90%
with going back to the stars.

00:15:00.647 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're alive
or dead doesn't matter.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:90%
They did both.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:10%
So if you're doing
initiation, the idea

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:10%
was that the Sem priest would
be in charge of your soul

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:10%
leaving the body in
a prescribed manner

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:10%
where you'd have an induced
near-death experience

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:10%
to go back to the stars.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:10%
And this is where
the jaguar comes in,

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:10%
because the spots
on the jaguar skin

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:10%
represent the stars
in the firmament.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.322 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very clever analogy.

00:15:25.322 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look for
exemplars of this,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.760 align:middle line:84%
let's call it a advanced race of
priests and priestesses that are

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
traveling the stars, we have
to look no further than the sem

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.790 align:middle line:90%
priests in ancient Egypt.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
They're noted for wearing their
jaguar skin or leopard skin

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:90%
cloaks.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
They're the Masters of
herbs and herbology,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and especially are masters
of the art of resurrection.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones
that are always

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
present in the opening of
the mouth ceremony when

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
the pharaoh is preparing to open
the gateways into the stars.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:84%
They're considered to
be astronomer priests.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.610 align:middle line:84%
They're involved with the
temple building as well.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And all of these are
attributes, the temple building,

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge of resurrection,
the understanding of herbs

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
promote human longevity.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
These are all attributes
of this leonine race

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.264 align:middle line:90%
that we find all over the world.

00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> As with most
ancient mysteries,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
the trail leads back to Egypt,
where the most concentrated

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and prominent collection of
feminine feline deities watch

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:90%
over this sacred land.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look to the feline
presence in ancient Egypt,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.050 align:middle line:10%
we see fantastic, powerful
goddesses for example,

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:10%
like Sekhmet and
statues abound by her.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
For example,
Amenhotep the third,

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:84%
there was over 700
statues of her.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:90%
She had a huge presence.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.650 align:middle line:10%
>> In the Egyptian traditions,
there are several feline

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:10%
deities.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:10%
The most popular and most
commonly known and oldest

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:10%
were Sekhmet and Bastet or Bast.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:10%
And of course, we also have
various other goddesses

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:10%
that appear as lions.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.990 align:middle line:10%
You have Wadjet, Tefnut.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.339 align:middle line:84%
So there are many goddesses that
would appear as a lion, always

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:90%
in the lioness form or the cat.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
The feline deities were
associated with Ra, the sun god,

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:84%
partly because of the lion
being associated with warmth,

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:84%
with the color yellow,
very solar kind of energy.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And so these goddesses,
often in their lion form,

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
were called the daughter
of Ra, sometimes

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:84%
called the Eye of Ra,
sometimes the Consort of Ra.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So like Sekhmet or
Bast would accompany

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Ra in the journey across the sky
and also through the underworld.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:07.160 align:middle line:84%
As the boat that would carry
Ra, the sun across the sky,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.400 align:middle line:84%
the lioness would be
there protecting him

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%
from any of his enemies.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And then through the
underworld and the journey

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
through the night,
she was the defender.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.548 align:middle line:84%
She would turn more into the
ferocious lion to defend him.

00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was her job to help
make sure that the sun would

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:90%
rise again the next day.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.792 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.792 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>> With the presence of the
feline embedded within several

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.230 align:middle line:84%
ancient cultures
around the planet,

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.850 align:middle line:84%
the masons of these megalithic
statues and monuments had

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
a superior understanding
of the powers of stone.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:10%
But did the sculptors of
these mighty protectors

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.400 align:middle line:10%
program them to protect
these sacred sites on more

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.210 align:middle line:10%
advanced, energetic levels?

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> In ancient Egypt, the statues
that were created by the stone

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
masons to be depictions of the
gods and goddesses were not just

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.890 align:middle line:84%
about the likeness of
the god or goddess.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:10%
They were meant to be
almost like embodiments

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:10%
of the god or goddess.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.360 align:middle line:90%
They were.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:84%
They were a house, a way
for that god or goddess

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:90%
to anchor into the physical.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What I think went into those
statues was stone programming.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And stone programming
was discovered way back

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:84%
with master dousers when
it comes to statues.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:10%
For instance, it was the
master douser Tom Lethbridge

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:10%
that said you could put a
polarity into a piece of stone,

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:10%
be that a statue or
a standing stone.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And that means if I'm
chiseling at a stone

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.920 align:middle line:84%
or I literally hold
a stone for a while,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:84%
it will register with a
pendulum a female polarity

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:90%
by going counterclockwise.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And a male working stone
would be the opposite.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.270 align:middle line:84%
It would be a clockwise
pendulum motion.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So we can see which
cultures, which gender rather

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:90%
made the statues.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And with the
statues of lionesses

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
throughout ancient Egypt,
they were made by women.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Because when I've doused
them at the British Museum

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.730 align:middle line:84%
and in Egypt itself, they always
register a female polarity.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So we are believed that it was
males that were the masons,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:84%
but I think it was
the females as well.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.050 align:middle line:10%
So it makes me think, you
see, that these statues

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:10%
to the ancient Egyptians
weren't statues.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:10%
They housed the soul.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:10%
They were the lion goddess.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.530 align:middle line:10%
They were Ramesses,
because Ramesses also

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:10%
did a lot of his statues.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I think with the stone
program and the chiseling,

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.735 align:middle line:90%
you've got living statues.

00:20:43.735 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're in the temples of
Egypt or in present day museums

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and you see examples of the
leonine goddesses, Sekhmet,

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Bastet, and others,
they are so lifelike.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And you are just compelled to
believe that the artists who

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
sculpted those must
have seen that being,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:84%
whether physically and
present in front of them

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:84%
or somehow in consciousness
because they are so lifelike.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:84%
We know that they're
all infused as well.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.460 align:middle line:84%
They're primarily
made of granite.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.890 align:middle line:84%
They're considered
to be living statues.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:84%
There's one in the
Ptah chapel at Karnak.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
They keep her locked up because
the local legend says otherwise,

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:84%
she'd walk around the
Karnak temple complex.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And people have had
amazing experiences

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
standing in front
of this statue.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes you wonder,
were these beings actually

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.990 align:middle line:84%
physically present walking
around in flesh and blood?

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just that they were
able to infuse these statues

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.510 align:middle line:90%
with their living presence?

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And those statues
effectively are those beings.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Without saying a word, when
I take a group into a temple,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.800 align:middle line:84%
of Sekhmet for example, I will
look around the room and almost

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
immediately, I'll see some
people just break down in tears

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:84%
because the image and the
archetype and the power

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and the wisdom that is
held in that image triggers

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:84%
an awareness, a memory,
an awakening within us,

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.560 align:middle line:90%
within our energy bodies.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:10%
And when we have those
experiences, that

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:10%
then is our opportunity
to go within ourselves,

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:10%
to go within our hearts
and ask the question, what

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.530 align:middle line:10%
does this image mean to me?

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
What is the significance of
this image in my life path?

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
What am I feeling
in this moment?

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, Sekhmet becomes
the catalyst, the trigger,

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
even in modern times that
awakens within us a deeper

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:90%
truth of our own existence.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.094 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.094 --> 00:22:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>> There is little doubt that
these supremely sophisticated

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.710 align:middle line:84%
works of art were
sculpted with purpose.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:55.275 align:middle line:84%
But the question remains,
who did they represent?

00:22:55.275 --> 00:22:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> All around the world,
there are myths and legends

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
of a feline race, of a race
of beings that are half human,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:90%
half feline.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
They play a role
in our evolution.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
They play a role as
guardians of sacred sites.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They're purveyors of
healing knowledge.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.540 align:middle line:84%
They are always presented
as benefactors of humanity.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:90%
But who are these beings?

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.140 align:middle line:90%
And where do they come from?

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that there is
actually a race of feline type

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.530 align:middle line:84%
beings, of humanoid felines
that once walked the planet that

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.550 align:middle line:90%
maybe still walk the planet?

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Or were these beings
that were just existing

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.900 align:middle line:90%
in human imagination?

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Were they accessed
through meditation?

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Were they accessed through
psychoactive substances?

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible, though,
that all over the world

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:84%
we have these stories of
these beings going back

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.432 align:middle line:84%
to the very beginning
of the human story?

00:23:50.432 --> 00:23:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking to the work of Anton
Parks, he talks about the Urmah,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
which are these massive feline
beings that come to Earth from

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.540 align:middle line:90%
another world.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They're protectors,
they're defenders.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
They help protect the
ancient civilizations

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.140 align:middle line:90%
and the people of Earth.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But who are they
protecting us from?

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:84%
We get some further insight
from the work of Swaruu

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
who also talk about the
Urmah as these 8 foot

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to 9 foot tall
feline beings that

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
resemble tigers or lions
that walk on two feet

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.800 align:middle line:90%
and weigh over 600 pounds.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Swaruu tells us that they
are protectors, defenders,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.730 align:middle line:84%
that they can be aggressive,
that they can be militant.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Swaruu tells us that they
are in direct opposition

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
to Draco, to the
Orion Council, who

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:43.620 align:middle line:84%
are in pursuit of their
service to self agenda

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to control and manipulate
humanity for their own means.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But the Urmahs are the
protectors and defenders.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.790 align:middle line:10%
They are working service to
others through their actions,

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:10%
protecting humanity and
all other humanoid beings

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.916 align:middle line:10%
across the galaxy.

00:24:59.916 --> 00:25:02.095 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:02.095 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:90%


00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The archaic galactic
intelligence known

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:84%
as the felines played a
significant role in seeding

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
humanoid genetics
throughout the galaxy.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was the felines
who chose this planet

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:84%
for its rich biodiversity
in the ecosystem,

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:84%
establishing it as one of
the many genetic libraries

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.730 align:middle line:90%
in our galaxy.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The primary mission
of the feline beings

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.130 align:middle line:84%
is to work systematically
and continuously

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:84%
with human society
in a nonviolent way,

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:84%
to work through
inspiration, imagination,

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and the collective
sharing of knowledge

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and the dissemination
of that knowledge

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.910 align:middle line:84%
so that the basic vibrational
resonant potential of humanity

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.370 align:middle line:90%
would rise to a higher octave.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The feline entities have created
several educational community

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:90%
hotspots here in ancient times.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
One of these hotspots was in
the area of ancient Egypt,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.370 align:middle line:84%
but the original
area was much larger.

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:84%
If we take the Carpathian
Sphinx specifically as a center,

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:middle line:84%
there's a powerful energy
field extending 1 to 1.2 miles

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.300 align:middle line:84%
in all directions with strong
nurturing and healing effects.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
The felines were teachers
of unity at all levels,

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and their philosophy
emphasized, among other things,

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:84%
that the evolutionary and
developmental goal of humanity

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and civilization is to unify
the energetic and qualitative

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:31.180 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the heart chakra with
the sixth and seventh chakras.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And achieving this will
initiate a state of inner unity.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And only when one attains
this so-called inner unity can

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.500 align:middle line:84%
they bring about a state
of outer unity, which

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.450 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to harmonize
the reality around them.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no question that
felines were one of the most

00:26:53.010 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
important totemic and animistic
forms that helped humanity

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:90%
evolve into what we are today.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:10%
It allowed us technology,
innovation, and cosmology,

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:13.080 align:middle line:10%
in other words, an
understanding of who we were

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.470 align:middle line:10%
and where we came from.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason why
we see those lions everywhere

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:84%
in front of the entrances
into temples and palaces

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and castles all the
way around the world.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> As the best science of the
modern world gives us deeper

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:34.200 align:middle line:84%
insights into our past, what
we find is that the role

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:84%
of the feline energy, feline
presence is consistent.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:90%
It's always been with us.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It's with us today.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I think we owe it to
ourselves to understand

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.730 align:middle line:90%
what is Sekhmet saying to us?

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
What is the power of
the feline say about us

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
to the world?

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
What did our ancestors
know in their time

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:84%
that we're only beginning
to understand in ours?

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>> As the power and influence of
these mighty felines continues

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:84%
to ripple through
our modern cities,

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
what other evidence will be
discovered to help us decipher

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
the codes and clues preserved in
stone by our ancient ancestors?
