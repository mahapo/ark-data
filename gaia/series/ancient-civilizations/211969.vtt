00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout history, several
writers and mystics have stated

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
that the area of the Caribbean
has the remnants of the once

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:90%
powerful Atlantean empire.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:10%
From Plato to Cayce
and Churchward,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:10%
there are tales from a time when
a great empire in the Atlantic

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.800 align:middle line:10%
Ocean was destroyed.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
As the relics of the
Maya, Inca, and Olmec

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
are strategically placed
throughout the Yucatan

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Peninsula, recent discoveries
on the ocean floor near Cuba

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:84%
create new questions
about the origins

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
of these influential
civilizations.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Was this area home to
an ancient civilization

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:84%
before the fires and floods
of the Younger Dryas period?

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.900 align:middle line:10%
>> In recent years, technology
now has allowed us to peer deep

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.560 align:middle line:10%
below the levels of the ocean
in ways that we hadn't been able

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:10%
to do in the past.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:10%
And what scientists are
finding, what's being revealed

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:10%
is that what we once
believed was virgin ocean

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.930 align:middle line:10%
floor obviously has been
above sea level in times

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:10%
past and not just a little bit.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It has been above sea level to
the point where massive cities

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and huge population centers
existed before the sea

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
levels rose and covered
them, in some cases,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:84%
over 2,000 feet below the
surface of the ocean such

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
as we're seeing off
the coast of Cuba.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
This was discovered
only recently.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Off the coast of India, the Gulf
of Khambhat, 9,500 years before

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
present is now being
dated a massive city

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
three miles long five
miles wide believed now

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
to be one of the sacred cities
described in the Mahabharata

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
that was believed to be a fairy
tale until side-scan sonar was

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:84%
able to reveal the existence
of the walls of this city.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.078 align:middle line:84%
And now the controversy is,
what does all of this mean?

00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing cities
off the coast of Japan.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.287 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing them
in the Atlantic.

00:02:31.287 --> 00:02:33.200 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing them off
the coast of Cuba.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.340 align:middle line:84%
These anomalies are now
becoming the new story.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.324 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2001, marine engineers
Paulina Zelitsky and Paul

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:10%
Weinzweig led an expedition off
the Western tip of Cuba's Pinar

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:10%
del Rio province.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
What they discovered over
2,000 feet below the surface

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.075 align:middle line:90%
shocked the world.

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:03.940 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a ship that
was basically doing sonar

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
experiments off the north
western coast of Cuba.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And they were initially
looking for shipwrecks,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.470 align:middle line:84%
looking for deposits of
oil to help the economy

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:90%
of the Cuban government.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:90%
Nothing more.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:10%
And then one day, they
were completely shocked

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.670 align:middle line:10%
when the sonar bounces off
the seabed about 2,500 feet

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:10%
below the surface.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:84%
>> At first, the marine
engineers had no idea what they

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:90%
were looking at.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.273 align:middle line:10%
They weren't trained
in archaeology.

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:30.190 align:middle line:10%
So these structures on
the bottom of the ocean

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:10%
seemed bizarre to them and that
they shouldn't exist at all.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
It can be difficult
to understand

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:90%
what's shown on sonar images.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
The white area in the
center represents the path

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:84%
the boat takes above the
water, which is sending down

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
sonar pulses to the bottom of
the ocean at a sideways angle.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
This is called
side-scan sonar, which

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
creates an effect that looks
like light hitting objects.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
The most iconic of these objects
shown in the sonar images

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
appears to closely
resemble features

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Mayan and Aztec step
pyramids such as the Pyramid

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:90%
of the Sun at Teotihuacan.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:84%
In front of the
pyramid-like feature,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.040 align:middle line:84%
we find what appears to
be the remnants of temple

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:84%
walls aligned perpendicular
to the pyramid

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:90%
but largely buried by sand.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Nearby the large
pyramid, we also

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
find highly enigmatic structures
with step-like features that

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
suggest they may be
smaller temples out

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:90%
in front of the pyramid.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:90%
One thing is for sure though.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:84%
These objects would
be impossible to be

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
created by nature.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Subsequently, they realized that
they had potentially discovered

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:90%
an underwater civilization.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Fearing that discovery and
how it might look on them

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.175 align:middle line:84%
as being academics,
they kept it quiet.

00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> They're confronted
with this massive complex.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like 7 square
miles and features

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
what appears to be
Mayan-style pyramids

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
with long walls and very
definite compartmentalized

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:10%
And they're almost
terrified by what

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:10%
they're seeing because how
could this possibly be?

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:10%
How can this city be
existing 2,000 feet

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:10%
underneath the
surface of the water?

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:90%
How did it get there?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:90%
How old could it possibly be?

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.565 align:middle line:84%
All of these questions
start to open up.

00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, this really
caused a sensation.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:10%
There were kind of
3D models made of it,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:10%
which looked amazingly
like pyramids.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:10%
But something was down
there because they'd

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:10%
been scanning the whole
area and really found

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:10%
nothing else that looked
like this organized, almost

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.930 align:middle line:10%
city-like scape at
the bottom of the sea.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the evidence for this
lost city was sonar images that

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:90%
looked incredibly impressive.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.160 align:middle line:10%
And these interested
a number of parties,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.865 align:middle line:10%
including National
Geographic Society

00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:56.880 align:middle line:10%
who were willing to fund
further exploration.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And what we needed
was more evidence

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:90%
of what was down there.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
ADC Communications

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
sent down an ROV, a Remote
Operated Video camera.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:10%
Aside from Nat Geo, the
Cuban Academy of Sciences

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.530 align:middle line:10%
also became involved with it.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:90%
They were incredibly intrigued.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And they sent one of
their leading geologists

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:90%
to get involved.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:10%
His name was Manuel Iturralde.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.880 align:middle line:10%
And he was actually present
when the remote-operated video

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:10%
cameras were sent
down 2,000 feet

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:10%
to try and get this valuable
evidence of exactly what was

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:10%
down there.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
The geometrical forms
were suggestive very

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
strongly that we were dealing
with artificial, let's say,

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:90%
human-made structure.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to see
some of these stone blocks.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And on a couple of
them, it actually

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:84%
even looked as if there may be
a few markings on them, maybe

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:90%
even glyphs.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
was is that you're

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.930 align:middle line:84%
so deep at 2,000 feet that you
have what they refer to as snow

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
around you all the time.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:84%
This is like material
debris that just gets

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:90%
swept through the currents.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
It looks like it's
snowing all the time.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And it just completely
messed up the images

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that were being sent
back to the surface.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And when these were seen by
Nat Geo and by Random House,

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:84%
they just thought this
is just not enough.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
This is not enough for us
to put our money into this.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
If you can come up
with better evidence,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:84%
then the deal's
back on the table.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:90%
But for the moment, we're out.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
ADC Communications

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
did not have that money.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is down there
remains there today.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We still don't know
exactly what is there.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.971 align:middle line:90%
It could be Atlantis.

00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:10%
>> After the initial flurry of
the excitement of the discovery

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:10%
in 2001, there were major
promises that were made

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:10%
by the Cuban government
and others that, oh, yeah,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.315 align:middle line:10%
we'll have an all-hands-on
deck exploration.

00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:12.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to the
bottom of this, what's going on

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.400 align:middle line:90%
out here off the coast of Cuba.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.125 align:middle line:90%
And then nothing happens.

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> They announced
it on BBC News.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And you know that
something's like official

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:90%
when it's on BBC News.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:10%
And then what was interesting
was it disappeared off the BBC

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:10%
News website pretty quickly.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.466 align:middle line:10%
And it was just a
weird reaction to it

00:08:31.466 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:10%
because you think, hey,
you find these structures.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Surely, the entire world
will stop what they're doing

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.538 align:middle line:84%
and send diving teams down,
and we're going to have CNN

00:08:39.538 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have
everything on this.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And the reaction
to it was weird.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's what sparked
my interest in it,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.490 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it sort of popped
up, disappeared, got hushed.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:54.026 align:middle line:84%
And it hasn't fully
been explored since.

00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not a
conspiracy theorist,

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle line:10%
but I do believe that
there's a sort of a big sort

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:10%
of conspiracy of silence around
this because it would literally

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.400 align:middle line:10%
upturn the entire events around
the Younger Dryas and the story

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:10%
that the Maya said, yes, we
inherited this whole thing from

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:10%
somebody else and
here's the exact date.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a tendency among
mainstream archaeology

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
to dismiss the idea that
there was a global flood,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
a global cataclysm, even though
it's talked about in dozens

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.970 align:middle line:84%
of civilizations
all over the world.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Modern archaeology says,
no, it didn't happen.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
So if they're confronted
with evidence of a lost

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:84%
civilization, that is very
challenging to mainstream

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:90%
archaeology.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%
We need a paradigm shift here.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps an exploration
such as this the coast of Cuba

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.572 align:middle line:84%
will lead to that
paradigm shift.

00:09:52.572 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If this is an ancient
city complex that has been

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
discovered and mainstream
science agrees that there

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a flood, could this
discovery present powerful

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
enough evidence to rewrite the
historical record and alter

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream timeline
of civilization?

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
As the mysteries and teachings
of many ancient traditions

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.630 align:middle line:84%
echo through Mesoamerica,
the question remains,

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.660 align:middle line:84%
who provided the
ancestral knowledge

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.626 align:middle line:90%
to these powerful civilizations?

00:10:30.626 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The ruins off the West Coast
of Cuba are at 2,000 feet.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.980 align:middle line:10%
That's a hell of
a long way down.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:90%
They're on a shelf.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Close by is fault lines,
close by is volcano,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
close by is rivers
suggesting that you're

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
dealing with an area that
was once above the surface.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we're looking at
this potential sunken city off

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
the coast of Western Cuba,
it really would, I believe,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
change the narrative of ancient
history however old it was,

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:84%
even if it was just a
few thousand years old,

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.110 align:middle line:84%
whether it's 10,000 or 12,000
years old because nothing like

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
that was supposed to exist
in this part of the world.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Even the Mayan site's
not that ancient.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And so this must be
older than those.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So we have to question, was
this the origin point, actually,

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:90%
of many of these civilizations--

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Maya, even the Inca,
the Olmecs even,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.976 align:middle line:84%
and other cultures
in North America?

00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that might
even be an early Olmec site

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.040 align:middle line:90%
or an early Olmec city.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So this brings up a whole
other series of questions

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.310 align:middle line:84%
because the myths we
find in the Yucatan,

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
also along the Gulf Coast,
but the Olmecs, the Maya,

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.550 align:middle line:84%
even the Aztecs, the
Mixtecs, the Zapotecs,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
they all have similar
stories of these civilizers,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.650 align:middle line:84%
these teachers coming
in from this land

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
somewhere across the
Atlantic, or in the Atlantic

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:84%
with these technologies,
with these ideas,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
with these civilizing
principles.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And so perhaps Cuba
was part of that

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's just been
misinterpreted

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:84%
as coming from Egypt or
Africa or from Europe.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> From the minimal imagery
that we see of this facility,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask the question,
did the Mayans know of this

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
place and adapt some of their
architectural designs from what

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:90%
they discovered?

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Or was it in fact a Mayan temple
that is somehow submerged?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
These are questions that
are still unanswered.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The interesting thing is that
the Indigenous Maya people have

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:84%
stories of that island landmass
being part of their ancestors

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
who was a highly sophisticated
civilization that was later

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:90%
destroyed.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:10%
And the fact that their
structures look very similar

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:10%
to the inland Mayan
structures is very telling.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It shows that they were
likely connected as part

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:90%
of the same civilization.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.170 align:middle line:10%
And when we look
to the comparisons

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:10%
with James Churchward's
map, the Atlantean region

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.980 align:middle line:10%
encompassed all the way to the
area of Cuba and the Yucatan,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:10%
the whole thing
starts to make sense.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
It seems to connect
to a lost story

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.470 align:middle line:84%
where Earth catastrophes were so
severe that civilizations were

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
being thrust to the
bottom of the ocean

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed by great
catastrophes that left

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.446 align:middle line:90%
very little that remains today.

00:13:29.446 --> 00:13:33.480 align:middle line:84%
>> As alternative researchers
examined the structure of this

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
planet and the massive shifts
it endured during the Younger

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Dryas.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
The question remains, did
this potentially ancient city

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:90%
literally sink?

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Based on its location,
its proximity, for example,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to Bimini where so much work has
been done about Atlantean type

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.320 align:middle line:84%
of structures under
the water there,

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
we have to ask the question,
if it's possible this could be

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.105 align:middle line:84%
some kind of an
Atlantean outpost.

00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Mayans speak of a
place called Atlan or Tollan.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder, are
we actually looking

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.605 align:middle line:84%
at a portion of Atlan or
Tollan in these images?

00:14:11.605 --> 00:14:15.595 align:middle line:84%
>> If you look at
the Maya traditions,

00:14:15.595 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:84%
they are very adamant that they
basically are the extension

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:84%
of a group of people called the
Itz And they came from a place

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:90%
called Atl.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
there was a big island

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the Atlantic
because, obviously, that's

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
where the word comes
from, Atl "Atlantic."

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And their civilization collapsed
after a massive mountains

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.985 align:middle line:84%
of fire came out of the
sky, obliterated their land.

00:14:39.985 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And the sea level was rising
so fast that the survivors were

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.760 align:middle line:84%
going from stepping stone
to stepping stone, which

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:84%
is such a-- it describes the
diminished rising of the land

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.630 align:middle line:90%
mass.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So Bermuda becomes
what it is today.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Cuba becomes what it is today.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're running
out of space,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and they eventually make their
way to the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And here, they
talk about the fact

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that this event
happened in 9,600 BC.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So you have one culture on
one side of the Atlantic

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that has exactly the same
date as another culture

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
Africa on the same date.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's very self-referencing.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the Yucatec
people describe the gods

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.270 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the same
fashion as the Egyptians do

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:30.356 align:middle line:84%
shows that this story
has a common source.

00:15:30.356 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Cuba itself was also once
joined to the Yucatan Peninsula

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:10%
of Mexico, where
we have legends,

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:10%
old Maya stories of a lost race
coming in from the Atlantic

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:10%
area and bringing their
traditions of Quetzalcoatl

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:10%
or Votan in other Mayan
traditions coming to that land

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.430 align:middle line:10%
and bringing civilization
from this lost sunken realm.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So it all kind of fits
together that this

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:84%
may be part of the ancient
lost landmass of Atlantis.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.842 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The peoples of Mesoamerica
have their own traditions

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:90%
of what we would call Atlantis.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:84%
They talk about an
island continent

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
that existed to the east
of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And they say that this is
where their ancestors lived,

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
and that suddenly
there was a cataclysm.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
There was a period of
darkness, and their ancestors

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
went underground into
something that they

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:90%
refer to as Chicomoztoc.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:10%
This means the seven caves.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:10%
And they remained there
throughout the whole

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:10%
of this terrible time when
you could not even light

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:10%
a fire outside, it was said.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
the light returned,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.780 align:middle line:84%
the sun began to
shine once more.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And they emerged out of
Chicomoztoc, the seven caves.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:10%
And they then sailed
westwards into what is today

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.520 align:middle line:10%
Central America and founded the
first clans, the first tribes,

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:10%
the first civilization.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And therefore these peoples look
towards this island continent

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:90%
as their homeland.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, where was that homeland?

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:90%
They call it Tulapan.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Tulapan means the old, old red
land And all of the evidence

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
seems to suggest
that this is Cuba.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
If you go to Cuba, you cannot
help but see the entire plane,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
the same plane that I think
Plato was talking about

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
in terms of Atlantis,
it's blood red.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.150 align:middle line:84%
The reason that it is blood
red is because the high amounts

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:90%
of iron in the soil.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is so noticeable
that this is something

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.090 align:middle line:84%
that the ancestors of
the Mesoamerican peoples

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.258 align:middle line:90%
would have remembered.

00:17:57.258 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason
why they would have called

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:90%
it the old, old red land.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:10%
>> We must remember when
we're looking at the stories

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:10%
of Atlantis, we're talking
about the stories of Plato,

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce, Ignatius Donnelly.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:20.440 align:middle line:10%
They spoke about, they
kind of hinted at an area

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:10%
around the Bahamas, around
that part of the Atlantic,

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.750 align:middle line:10%
which could be part of Atlantis.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And Cuba may well have
been part of that.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And so was this the
discovery of a lifetime?

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Was this Atlantis
being discovered?

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.195 align:middle line:90%
Or was it an anomaly?

00:18:36.195 --> 00:18:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if we're
going to follow Plato,

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
center makes sense,

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
that the island that disappeared
would be in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
However, the empire
of Atlantis I believe

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.860 align:middle line:84%
was probably from
the South of Spain

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to North of Africa across
the Canary Islands,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
across the islands in the
center of the Atlantic

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
that have now disappeared right
over to Cuba, the Bahamas,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.160 align:middle line:90%
and the opposite continent.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Plato literally
describes it as Atlantis

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.065 align:middle line:84%
being an empire of islands,
a main island, and then

00:19:06.065 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:84%
across to the
opposite continent.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So I think that whole
slice of the world

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.936 align:middle line:84%
was probably the
Atlantean empire.

00:19:12.936 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Cayce said that
Atlantis drowned or certainly

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.470 align:middle line:90%
submerged in two parts.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
He said that the
first part of it,

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the main part of it
sank around 50,000 years ago.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And that the final remnants
of Atlantis, which he said

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
were in the areas of the
Bahamas and the Caribbean

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:90%
sank around 10,500 BC.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's what 12,500 years ago.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.070 align:middle line:10%
And the evidence that
we now have from science

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.460 align:middle line:10%
to do with the Younger Dryas
event and possibly much earlier

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:56.430 align:middle line:10%
events to do with Cuba and
the sinking of its lost city

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:03.210 align:middle line:10%
seems to tell us that Cayce was
on the money in both instances.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.330 align:middle line:10%
And I find that
beyond coincidence.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.450 align:middle line:10%
What did Cayce know about this?

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.620 align:middle line:10%
What was he saying?

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:84%
All we can say is
that Cayce said

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.910 align:middle line:84%
that if you want
to find Atlantis,

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
look towards the Caribbean
because that is where

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.115 align:middle line:90%
the answers will be found.

00:20:21.115 --> 00:20:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> When we begin looking at
the archaeological evidence

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:84%
recently discovered
off the coast of Cuba,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
vast population
center, vast city,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at it within
the context of other discoveries

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
in the area not in the vacuum
of only this one discovery.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We begin to think about
the Bermuda Triangle.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:84%
We begin to think about
the archaeological evidence

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:84%
discovered under the ocean
throughout the Caribbean.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to
say that these are relics,

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:54.580 align:middle line:84%
they're remnants of what we once
called Atlantis and offshoots

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:90%
of Atlantis.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And the influence
that Atlantis had

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and the communication with
Latin America and with Mexico

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and even the American desert
Southwest as the sea levels

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.770 align:middle line:84%
were lower, land
bridges were exposed,

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:10.800 align:middle line:84%
migration was possible
that looks impossible

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
to us today because we think in
terms of isolated landmasses.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.280 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
a time in history

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:84%
when that communication
would have been

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:90%
much easier than it is today.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we are dealing with
the loss of a civilization

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.120 align:middle line:84%
here, then what incredible
mechanism would have been

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
involved in sending an entire
civilization down 2,000 feet?

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Was it some kind of
cosmic event like a comet?

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Was it a volcano erupting?

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Was it some kind
of super tsunami?

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Or was it all of them?

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Mayan legends have been
mostly misunderstood by modern

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.790 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Their famous Tzolkin calendar
created several alternative

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:84%
theories around potential
astronomical and Earth changes

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.510 align:middle line:84%
in the year 2012 when
their legendary calendar

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:90%
came to an end.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Whether we examine Mayan
stories, Greek mythology,

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:84%
or psychic readings,
the evidence

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:84%
is mounting that the
Caribbean was once home

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to an advanced ancient
civilization that

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.910 align:middle line:90%
was destroyed by cataclysms.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.313 align:middle line:84%
>> The fun part about trying
to reconstruct the world before

00:22:32.313 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
the Younger Dryas is the fact
that the Earth looks nothing

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:90%
like what it used to.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Not only do you have to
deal with the melting ice

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.030 align:middle line:84%
caps and the raising
of sea levels,

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.640 align:middle line:84%
you also have tectonic
movements which created

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:90%
huge shifts in land masses.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So for example, in
the Atlantic, you

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
have the land mass of Atlantis,
which basically breaks up

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
into three pieces which
then becomes three

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.320 align:middle line:90%
large pieces and seven islands.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Part of Bermuda was
part of that land mass.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:90%
Cuba was part of that land mass.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The whole chain
around the Caribbean

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:90%
was also part of that land mass.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, not only does
it go down into the ocean,

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
it also gets subverted
by a tectonic activity

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.340 align:middle line:90%
and volcanic activity.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
Younger Dryas, you

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.880 align:middle line:84%
have meteorites
coming out of the sky

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.550 align:middle line:90%
hitting all parts of the Earth.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look at the concept

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
that big chunks hit
specific parts of the planet

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:84%
exactly where you
don't want them to hit,

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:84%
which are basically places
which are tectonically

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:90%
quite sensitive.

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.440 align:middle line:84%
The coast of Cuba
is one of them.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a big
geological shift there.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.560 align:middle line:10%
So if you have a big
displacement of the land, which

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:10%
has been pummeled by
large rocks and you're

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:10%
getting the shock waves going
through the Earth's crust,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:10%
any place which is already
on a very sensitive ledge

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.840 align:middle line:10%
is basically either
going to collapse

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:10%
or it's going to
fracture in one go.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And looking at the sonar
images around the coast of Cuba

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.950 align:middle line:84%
with this sunken
city, it suggests

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that the entire section
of land literally just

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:84%
went like this in
one piece, which

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:84%
is why the destruction is not
so bad the whole thing went down

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:90%
in one go.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> There were many theories
about what is going on off

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:14.280 align:middle line:84%
the West Coast of Cuba at this
immense depth under the water

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
because people have debated,
how could anything like that

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:84%
survive this long if it's
thousands of years old,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.540 align:middle line:84%
if it goes back to the Atlantean
era or whenever it may be

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:84%
because it would
have been destroyed,

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:84%
especially if it went down in
the cataclysm and sunk from

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
the surface level
going that far deep.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It would have just
destroyed itself.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's different
ideas about that

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.560 align:middle line:84%
because we're
finding lots of ruins

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.430 align:middle line:84%
are found around the
world off coastal areas

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of very extreme depth, which
do suggest some of them

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:90%
could survive.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the theories, which
is quite intriguing as

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:84%
to how it could have
survived is the idea

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
that it actually was literally
unlike a tectonic plate

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.720 align:middle line:84%
from one side of the
mid-Atlantic ridge.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And it just went down neatly
to the bottom of the sea,

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
not just a few
hundred meters like

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.690 align:middle line:84%
we find with traditional
submerged areas,

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:90%
but 4, 5, 6 times that deep.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And somehow it survived
the kind of sudden drop.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was probably covered over
in mud and silt immediately.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, that may
have preserved it.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Or it may have been constructed
in such a way, such hard core

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
megaliths pieced together
with such accuracy that

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.450 align:middle line:84%
might have protected it,
it might have saved it.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking
about people who say

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
they photographed and witnessed
10 foot wide blocks of stone.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So that is really
intriguing because that

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.580 align:middle line:84%
could be relationship to
the polygonal, the cyclopean

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
construction we find
in other areas, which

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
is known to survive
earthquakes, almost designed

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:90%
to be earthquake-proof.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we can speculate on
this, we can discuss this,

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:90%
but we need to get down there.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.500 align:middle line:84%
We need to take another look
because lots of the myths, lots

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
of the stories, lots of the
Atlantean traditions point

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:11.106 align:middle line:84%
to this area in
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:26:11.106 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems that based on
the dynamics of this area,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:84%
the site was destroyed
in some components,

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.130 align:middle line:84%
but it was also
preserved in some ways.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And someday if we ever get
the clarity and the freedom

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to be able to study these
places and go down and look,

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of our
ancient history and our past

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:90%
will change forever.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Like with the Bimini
Road, like with the Azores,

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.120 align:middle line:84%
other areas like this need to
be researched more to prove

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:84%
if this is a really advanced
ancient civilization

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.902 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of the sea.

00:26:44.902 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a battle
for our story,

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:84%
and there's a battle
for our history.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.492 align:middle line:84%
And there's a battle
to maintain what

00:26:51.492 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:90%
is called the standard model.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to the
way we think of ourselves,

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.490 align:middle line:84%
the origin of our civilization,
the origin of our planet,

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.760 align:middle line:84%
our universe, and
even our own species,

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.690 align:middle line:84%
the new story is saying
to us that our planet has

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
been populated and that vast
civilizations have existed

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:84%
in times past when
the sea levels were

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:90%
much lower than we see today.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was through the
catastrophic events

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that unfolded during the
time of the Younger Dryas

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:90%
those sea levels rose.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And as some people
say, we became

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.420 align:middle line:90%
a forgotten civilization.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:90%
We lost our history.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And as we allow
for this evidence

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:84%
to become a part of what
it is that has happened

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to us in the past, we
tell a new human story.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And with that new human
story, new possibilities

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.432 align:middle line:90%
for our future.

00:27:44.432 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> As Earth mapping
technology continues to alter

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:53.330 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream timeline for
the rise of human civilization,

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:58.070 align:middle line:84%
what other evidence will be
discovered and revealed to link

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:03.110 align:middle line:84%
this legendary area known as
the Caribbean to the ancient

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Atlantean empire that was
destroyed roughly 11,600 years

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:90%
ago?

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:90%
