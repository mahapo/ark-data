>> The discovery of Gobekli
Tepe in Anatolia in Turkey has

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
deemed it the oldest known
megalithic site in the world

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:90%
by mainstream science.

Dr. Klaus Schmidt in 1996,

Gobekli Tepe's circular
temples have forever

at the beginnings
of civilization,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
and in more ways than one.

In 1997 an expert on cereals,
Professor Manfred Heun

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
at the Norwegian
University of life sciences

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
started investigating
an area close

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to Gobekli Tepe for
evidence that would lead him

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:90%
to the first grains.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:10%
His discovery of einkorn, an
ancient, single grain wheat

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.060 align:middle line:10%
took him 20 miles northwest
to the mountain of Karadag,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:10%
the same mountain
Anton Parks was

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:10%
able to trace the Sumerian
version of the garden of Eden.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:10%
Heun believes this grain
was the first cereal,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:10%
and older than any other
grain known to man.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:84%
The extensive lab results
proved that the specimens

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:84%
of einkorn and Emmer wheat
dated back to 10,500 years ago.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:10%
An article boasting
his work stated,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:10%
"Just as the dog
evolved from the wolf,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:10%
and pigs evolved from
boars, our cereals

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:10%
have been significantly
altered by human civilization.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.710 align:middle line:84%
But what if humans were
altered by the cereals

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:90%
they ate as well?"

>> The area of Turkey called
Anatolia plays a huge role

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:90%
in the human story.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.830 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know, that's
where the first indications

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:90%
of organized agriculture appear.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And they appear around
about 11,600 years ago.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.270 align:middle line:10%
Why these things should have
happened in Anatolia rather

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:10%
than somewhere else
isn't really a question

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:10%
I can absolutely
answer, except to say

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps the land
was conducive to what

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:10%
needed to be done there.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
We're to envisage a group of
hunter-gatherers who wake up

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:84%
one morning, equipped with all
the skills necessary to create

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.130 align:middle line:84%
what does turn out
to be the largest

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.123 align:middle line:90%
Where did those skills develop?

The only thing
that archaeologists

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.370 align:middle line:84%
can do to explain
this is kind of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
suggest that that must have
been an especially gifted group

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:90%
of hunter-gatherers.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
They kind of gloss
over the fact that we

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:84%
can't see any evidence
of the evolution

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:90%
or development of these skills.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Their only explanation
can be that somehow

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:84%
a group of
hunter-gatherers, even

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
though we see no evidence of
them practicing or learning

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
how to do this, they
must have woken up

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
one morning just
magically equipped

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.820 align:middle line:84%

extraordinary, astronomically

aligned, gigantic,
megalithic site.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And just as by sort
of an afterthought,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
they also invented
agriculture at the same time.

And also something else
similar, in Sumerian texts

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:84%

of rations and wheat.

Indeed, she can also be
called Demeter in Greek.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:84%

is more evidence that there
was a high civilization

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:90%

What I think we're looking
at is an outreach program,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
an outreach program reaching out
to the hunter-gatherers in what

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:84%
we would call the
upper paleolithic,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to
teach certain of them

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:84%
selected skills, giving them
the gifts of civilization.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I think what
happened in Anatolia

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.760 align:middle line:84%
was that the survivors
of a lost civilization,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
wiped out during the cataclysmic
episode that immediately

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
preceded 11,600 years ago, chose
Anatolia as one of the places

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:84%
where they would settle and
attempt to rebuild or recreate

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:90%
what had been lost.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We have evidence that there
were advanced civilization.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:10%
There was advanced
civilization or civilizations,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:10%
advanced, sophisticated
cultures that

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:10%
arose before the end
of the last ice age.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:10%
So we can think in round
terms of about 10,000 BC.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
There was a natural
catastrophe that

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:84%
occurred at 9,700 BC, snapped
us out of the Ice Age.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And what I've determined, and
piecing the evidence together,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
is that what caused it at 9,700
BC was a major solar outburst.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
People can think
of solar flares,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
but much larger than anything
we've ever seen or experienced

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
in modern times, what's known
as coronal mass ejections,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
in some cases what would've
looked like huge lightning

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:84%
bolts literally hit the
surface of the Earth,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
melted glaciers virtually
instantaneously.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:84%
This released pressure,
set up earthquake activity,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:90%
set off volcanic activity.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And actually in the
present day, we now

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.570 align:middle line:84%
know that volcanic and
Earth like activity

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
correlates with solar activity
even in the present day.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you had a massive
solar outburst like this,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.870 align:middle line:84%
it would have been order
of magnitudes larger.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Did these ancient people
survive a cataclysm so great

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
that they started to rebuild
a new society near the most

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:84%
important ancient
monument at the time?

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.300 align:middle line:84%
A society that required
a new kind of food.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The earliest evidence we
have of cultivated grain is

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
in southern Turkey
near the Syrian border.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, there were
grains before that,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:10%
but this is the
cultivation of grains,

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.932 align:middle line:10%
which means there's a slightly
different kind of grain,

00:07:17.932 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:10%
or something evolved or changed,
something new about the grain

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:10%
that allowed it to be
planted, that allowed people

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:10%
to settle and not be nomads.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.880 align:middle line:84%
So civilization is to
be dated from that one

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:90%
development, that one event.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:90%
It's all about grain.

>> Is it possible that the
agricultural revolution began

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:10%
near Gobekli Tepe because humans
wanted to stay near the site,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:10%
and to do so they needed to
feed the people that migrated

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:10%
to this ancient spot
after a cataclysm?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Could the old ways
of gathering of wild

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
wheat to eat have
not been enough

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.860 align:middle line:84%
for such a population
in one area?

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
But how then could
the cultivation

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.840 align:middle line:84%
of an intense amount
of crops begin?

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Billy Carson suggests
that there might

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.755 align:middle line:90%
have been an intervention.

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a great cataclysm
that pretty much separated

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:10%
humanity.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:10%
And the pre-Adamites were
leading humanity at that time.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.713 align:middle line:84%
Most of the pre-Adamites
died in the cataclysm.

00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
The ones who did not die were
spread out across the Earth,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.567 align:middle line:84%
and they began to
re-establish civilizations.

00:08:20.567 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And to bring humanity
together so they

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%
can teach them animal husbandry
and how to grow crops.

Not just the grains,
but a lot of corn,

00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the different
things that we harvest

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
were genetically engineered
by the non terrestrial groups.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
They were brought here
from another planet

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.987 align:middle line:84%
and genetically spliced
with native plants.

00:08:36.987 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason we know this
is that when you look back

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:84%
at the historical record,
looking at fossils

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
you don't see these genetically
engineered wheats or grasses.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.545 align:middle line:90%
You only see the wild grasses.

00:08:46.545 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
These crops seemed
to appear here

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:84%
out of the blue on
the historical record.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And the historians have
located ancient grains

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:90%
in Anatolia, Turkey.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.653 align:middle line:84%
So what are the chances
that these grains

00:08:55.653 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
are going to have their
birthplace in the same place

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:90%
that humanity did?

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the ancients have
genetically altered the grasses

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:04.790 align:middle line:90%
of Earth?

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And if so, how did that
modify the human DNA?

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Food as it pertains to our
DNA structure can literally be

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:10%
traced back to what we would
call an interaction with what

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:10%
some people call the
Annunaki, with this non-human

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.110 align:middle line:10%
intelligence.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:10%
Now, there was a goddess,
and she was apparently

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:10%
a geneticist, when you read
these ancient Sumerian tablets.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's at this
time of interaction

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
that pretty much every cereal
grain appears on the Earth.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Before that we just had nothing.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
We can't trace them
past a certain point.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is it's at this stage

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that ancient civilization
just explodes.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:10%
As soon as these cereal
grains begin to appear,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:10%
all of these ancient
civilizations begin to appear.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:90%
At first there was nothing.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Then all of a sudden
we have civilization

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:90%
after civilization.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Add mathematics, culture.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:90%
They're building monuments.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:84%
They're performing
agricultural feats.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe that all of
that can be equated

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
to the introduction of these
cereal grains into our DNA,

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:84%
because she was
actually affecting

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
human DNA at that
time through a number

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.040 align:middle line:90%
of different experiments.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this might be
where the Babylonian bloodlines

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:90%
are originated from.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the
bloodlines, or elite,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.680 align:middle line:84%
had been created as a result
of the cultivation of wheat?

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, is
it possible that this

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
was the first hierarchy created
within the human population

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:84%
between those that
cultivate the land and those

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:90%
who benefit from it?

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
If humans could not roam any
more for their food in the wild

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
as they had done as
hunter-gatherers,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.080 align:middle line:84%
then did these humans
fall into a system

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that would make them dependent
on the cultivation of food

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:90%
to survive?

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.363 align:middle line:84%
Could evidence lead us
back to the garden of Eden?

00:11:03.363 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We seem to trace everything
back to this garden of Eden

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:90%
as the cradle of civilization.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that it is not
the cradle of civilization.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.880 align:middle line:84%
It is the cradle
of re-civilization.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.500 align:middle line:84%
A civilization prior had
fallen, and afterwards,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:84%
after a cataclysm,
they had to rebuild.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.870 align:middle line:90%
And that is where they began.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> But the idea of the garden of
Eden essentially is a metaphor

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
for bringing and restoring
order to the face of the Earth.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, that works on one level.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:84%
On the other level,
you can also establish

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
a physical garden of Eden,
where you have animal husbandry.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And you had the growth
of cereal crop structures

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.262 align:middle line:90%
which are now coherent.

00:11:37.262 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:10%
So all of these
things are built up

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.750 align:middle line:10%
into a kind of orderly
environment, which

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:10%
by its nature, by people
actually interacting

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:10%
with this orderly
environment, they themselves

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:10%
rise from a state of barbarism
into a state of order

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.360 align:middle line:10%
and perfection.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And the people that kind of
came up with this concept

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
appear to have been people
who are human or human like,

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:90%
but somehow different.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And they often are described
as being very tall.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:84%
They certainly knew about how
to domesticate cattle and crops.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So they obviously came from
some kind of a godly caste.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But back then you have to
understand the gods were not

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:90%
necessarily people.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Gods were forces of
nature, but there

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
were people who also personified
those forces of nature.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:90%
So they had the understanding.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.013 align:middle line:84%
They had the processes
of ancient knowledge,

00:12:22.013 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
which goes back thousands,
hundreds of thousands of years.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to impose
that on the actual land

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.140 align:middle line:84%
to bring humanity back
into a state of order

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.735 align:middle line:90%
from this terrible catastrophe.

00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
So they understood how
nature works, the dynamics

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.030 align:middle line:90%
of the systems of the universe.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.033 align:middle line:90%
So they became as gods.

00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
we get that sort

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:84%
of overlap of thinking that
these people were themselves

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:90%
gods.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.990 align:middle line:90%
They were actually godlike.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Could these godlike beings be
the characters in the Sumerian

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:90%
text?

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
these beings could

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.890 align:middle line:84%
be the elite the ancient
text talk about that

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.960 align:middle line:84%
bring cultivation
to the human race?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:84%
According to Jack Cary's
research, a battle for humanity

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:84%
takes place between
these gods, and the seeds

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:84%
are the only thing
that will help

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:90%
the human population continue.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of occult adepts will
tell you that at some point it

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:84%
looks as though a massive
falling out had taken place

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
between the leadership of this
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And Enki and Enlil, and you
get into that whole family

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.190 align:middle line:84%
squabble, they discovered
that the leadership

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:84%
wanted to wipe out humanity,
the source of the Great Flood

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.040 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of cultures.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And Enki are just
mortified, horrified

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
destroy their invention,

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful creature
that they had created,

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.010 align:middle line:90%
just completely wipe it out.

>> Ninmah is considered a queen
who's going to enforce her law

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:10%
on Karadag, who's going to
be in charge of the colony,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:10%
and will oversee the
whole Inunaz installation

and survival process
on the Eden mountain.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to know that Ninmah is
a central figure in this story.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
She is a queen from the
beginning until the end.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:84%
She will remain queen,
one of Tiamat's daughters.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
She is Enlil's wife at first,
but much later in the story

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.280 align:middle line:90%
she gets closer to Enki.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And we realize that at
some point she married him

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and that she's had
a change of heart.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
She has changed clan for the
betterment of the Earth's

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:90%
agriculture and life in general.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.105 align:middle line:10%
>> Before the deluge,
Ninmah made a bank of seeds

00:14:40.105 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:10%
on the genome, and she had a
bank of the genome of animals.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:10%
And she gave that to Ziusudra
to put on his Sumar symbol.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:10%
So they were the first seeds.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:10%
It was like a museum.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:10%
It was all kinds of different
seeds of wheat, of grains.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:10%
And it had been housed with
boxes with the seeds very

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.900 align:middle line:10%
neatly sorted out.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.980 align:middle line:10%
And it was immensely old.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:10%
It seems like after
the deluge, they

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:10%
started to plant again those
seeds in the mountains,

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:10%
in the Zagros mountains,
that was the first one

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:10%
to be free from
the water and mud.

which was when humans started

domesticating
plants and animals,

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and started building these
big constructions was one

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
of the most important turning
points in human history.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Before that, humans
were hunter-gatherers.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:10%
The only reason why you
and I are not out there

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:10%
hunting mastodons right now was
because of that domestication

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:10%
process that started back then.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Right around the
Gobekli Tepe area,

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:90%
that changed everything for us.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to the
Mesopotamian texts,

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
some say, well, the gods
were really only doing it

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
They really weren't out
there to help humans.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, it had a huge
beneficial effect for us.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Could this beneficial fact of
domestication had been an idea

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
given to us by
the Sumerian gods?

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And was it a benefit at all?

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Could the agricultural
revolution

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:84%
just be another way to
enslave the human race?

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
a civilization based

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
on the cultivation
of plants in one area

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:90%
enslave us to that area?

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Billy Carson has some
interesting information

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.225 align:middle line:90%
on this idea.

00:16:44.225 --> 00:16:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> According to my research, the
Annunaki came from a different

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
barometric pressure, a
different gravitational field.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So working on this planet
was difficult for them.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.950 align:middle line:10%
So they decided to
genetically engineer

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:10%
the beings that were already
here with their own genetics.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.688 align:middle line:84%
They wanted someone to
help them till the Earth.

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So they genetically
engineered human beings

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.640 align:middle line:90%
to basically be their gardeners.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Human beings were
genetically spliced

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.786 align:middle line:84%
all over the planet
during this time period.

00:17:08.786 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, they
brought from their home planet

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.067 align:middle line:90%
grains that they would consume.

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:15.109 align:middle line:84%
They then spliced them
with grasses here on Earth

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to create a grain that they
could have human beings then

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.340 align:middle line:90%
harvest for them.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Andrew Collins points out
that once the humans left

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.880 align:middle line:84%
the area of Gobekli Tepe, they
spread out all over the world

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:84%
with the same system
of civilization.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>> After the closure
of Gobekli Tepe,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and these settlements began
to spread outwards like waves

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and created what's known as
the Neolithic Revolution,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
taking with them new
ideas in agriculture,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
animal domestication,
metallurgy,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:84%
the production of alcohol in
the form of wine and beer,

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:90%
then tool technologies.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:10%
These ideas gradually move
southwards, as well as

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:10%
westwards, eastwards, and
blooming northwards as well,

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:10%
and end up going through the
area of the Levant, which today

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:10%
is the countries of
Palestine and Israel,

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:10%
and reach Egypt as early
as 8,000, 8,500 BC.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And that here, within sight
of the Great Pyramids,

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:34.490 align:middle line:84%
or where it would later be
built, a settlement arose.

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And that amongst these
were highly sophisticated

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
stone tool technologies
which are found identical

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:90%
at Gobleki Tepe.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In Gobekli Tepe and the
surrounding regions we find

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
the sudden emergence of what
can only be called civilization.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:84%
If the Sumerian gods, or elite
did recreate a new human race

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
that depended on
agriculture, where

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:84%
can we see evidence of this
same process around us today?

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Biotech corporations today are
genetically altering seeds.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.310 align:middle line:84%
It involves altering the genetic
makeup of a crop in some way,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:84%
typically for the
purpose of making

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:90%
that crop perform better.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:84%
DNA is extracted from animals,
viruses, bacteria, insects,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and even humans,
and then inserted

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.380 align:middle line:90%
into the DNA of the crop.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:90%
This is referred to as GMOs.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It has been stated
that GMOs will

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:84%
help solve world hunger
by providing crops that

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:90%
can grow in harsh climates.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
However, some
scientists have been

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
able to link these GMO seeds
to obesity, diabetes, asthma,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
fertility problems, food
allergies, and even cancer.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.290 align:middle line:84%
All of these conditions
change our DNA.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Are we becoming an even
different form of human today

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:90%
with these new foods?

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.275 align:middle line:10%
>> If we look at the
mystery in the vacuum,

00:20:04.275 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:10%
all we can do is speculate, but
when we look within the broader

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:10%
context we already know that
human DNA was fused in a way

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.530 align:middle line:10%
that cannot be explained
through evolution.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
It happened 200,000 years
ago, precisely the time

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:84%
that the Sumerian
traditions tell us

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that the kingship from the
heavens arrived on Earth.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.918 align:middle line:10%
Now, as a scientist I can't say
that one is because of another,

00:20:30.918 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:10%
but what I can say as a
scientist is that there's

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:10%
a very high correlation
between the time

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:10%
that the records show
that something very unique

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.110 align:middle line:10%
happened in the
Tigris, Euphrates,

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.087 align:middle line:10%
in Turkey, in this
part of the world,

00:20:44.087 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:10%
and the physical evidence that
we're seeing right now in terms

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.140 align:middle line:10%
of technology.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Anatolia in Turkey,
for example, is

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
a region where the DNA
studies of the grain that

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
has been uncovered
now are showing us

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
it's the first place
that modern cereals,

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that we take for
granted today, appeared

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
from native grasses that had
been grown there in the past.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
why did this happen?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Is this a spontaneous
emergence of the cereals?

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Or as we're doing today,
were those grasses somehow

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:90%
genetically modified?

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
As strange as it
sounds to some people,

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.400 align:middle line:84%
the idea that we may
have had the ability

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:84%
to genetically engineer not
only our bodies with our food

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.223 align:middle line:90%
in the past--

00:21:28.223 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
maybe the other way
around, not only our food,

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
but our bodies in
the past, I think

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:84%
is gaining credibility
among scientists

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
who are willing to honestly
look at the evidence that's

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:90%
being presented.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Sean Stone suggests that
the DNA these ancient grains

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:49.980 align:middle line:84%
originated from may have, in
fact, come from another world.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Panspermia is essentially
the notion of bacteria and other

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
living organisms spreading
to other planets from comets

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and other space
debris essentially.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
We know for a fact
that panspermia exists.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.890 align:middle line:10%
And so the idea of if bacteria
and other living organisms can

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.100 align:middle line:10%
make it to Earth from
other planets, then

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:10%
certainly grains and other foods
could have been brought here.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Panspermia concept
is a random act.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:84%
This is potentially
a deliberate one.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But we know, given our history,
that since we are altering

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:84%
the genetic makeup of
foods, we're obviously

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.710 align:middle line:84%
starting to play
God by tampering

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:35.270 align:middle line:84%
with the entire genomic
structure of not only plants,

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:90%
but actually humans.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Then certainly it's feasible
that some type of alien beings

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:84%
did essentially alter grains
in order for human civilization

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.737 align:middle line:90%
to begin.

00:22:45.737 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only were their genetic
differences from another planet

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
in the grasses, but the actual
consuming of these cereals

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:84%
caused human beings to begin
to change environmentally.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Our teeth began to change.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Our bone structures
began to change.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was because we
were able to get nutrition

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:84%
on a regular basis
instead of being foragers.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as the issue of
tampering with genetics,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.942 align:middle line:84%
and not only in foods,
but also in humans,

00:23:10.942 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:84%
we're actually seeing
something very interesting now,

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.480 align:middle line:84%
the idea of actually
creating DNA vaccines.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.490 align:middle line:10%
Scientists are already
coming up with a plan

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.860 align:middle line:10%
to use things like Zika
as a basis for putting

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:10%
human DNA into a
vaccine and then

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:10%
injecting people with that DNA.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So the DNA would essentially
give orders and instructions

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to your body to
combat the Zika virus.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is it creates
all types of consequences that

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
have not really been
discussed or debated properly,

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
which is to say if the DNA
is absorbed into your system,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:84%
how will it alter your
entire DNA structure?

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:84%
How will it pass on to
your future generations?

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So these are the really
interesting questions

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that are being raised
now, because we've

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
become more and more
familiar with nature

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
of the genomic
structure of humans

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility of
tailoring future generations

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.520 align:middle line:90%
to the will of science.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But we don't necessarily
understand all the consequence

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:84%
of what that will entail,
because it doesn't just

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:90%
end with you.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.600 align:middle line:84%
It ends with your children,
and their children,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.850 align:middle line:90%
and their children's children.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.230 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps these issues
bring up another concept,

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:27.430 align:middle line:10%
which is if our DNA is being
altered by the food we eat,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.700 align:middle line:10%
and this can be traced back
to an ancient agricultural

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:10%
revolution that created
elite versus the worker,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:10%
could this mean that our
societal structure is based

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:10%
on enslavement to cultivation?

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible our
ancient ancestors

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:84%
became a different kind
of human once we agreed

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:90%
to be part of this system?

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Could this explain the
ancient struggle for power

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.860 align:middle line:84%
over the masses by Sumerian
gods such as Enki and Enlil?

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And where might we
find more evidence

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:84%
of these alternative
forces all over the globe?

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I think in the past female
cultures have been given a bad

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:90%
press.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:10%
We know about kingship.

We know about great
battles fought by men.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
whole civilizations

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.210 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be focused around
patriarchal societies.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
But clearly that was not the
case in prehistoric times.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:10%
It would seem as if the female
had a much stronger role

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:10%
in society.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Up next, the mysterious
disappearing woman within

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:42.610 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Is this the link to
a much older culture

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.110 align:middle line:90%
that resided here on Earth?
