00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Ancient Memphis-- throughout
the historical record,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:10%
this once-great capital city
of ancient Egypt was home

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.260 align:middle line:10%
to several mystics, healers,
psychics, and scientists,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:10%
and became an epicenter for
spiritual transformation

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.200 align:middle line:10%
and alchemy.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.490 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian deity, Thoth, was
an enlightened, pre-diluvian

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:84%
master, who was
later known as Hermes

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Trismegistus in ancient Greece.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.120 align:middle line:84%
This wise elder
was believed to be

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.670 align:middle line:84%
the architect of the
pre-diluvian temple

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
system along the Nile, where
he taught certain practices

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
for both spiritual and
chemical alchemy that remained

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
the foundational
teachings for the math

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020 align:middle line:90%
and mystical arts of Memphis.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.080 align:middle line:84%
A deeper look into the
initiation practices

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
of the pharaohs in this region
reveals alchemical clues

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to a sacred element, served
as a cone-shaped cake that

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
may have enhanced their
connection to the cosmos.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
What other clues remain
beneath the sacred sand

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to help alternative researchers
illuminate the power

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge of the ancient
alchemists, priests, artists,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.253 align:middle line:84%
and architects, who called the
land known as Memphis home?

00:01:45.253 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Egypt was very well known
throughout the ancient world

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:10%
as being a land of the wise, and
alchemy had its birth in this

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:10%
land of the wise.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And so the order of
priesthood of Egypt,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and especially around
Memphis and the capital,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
they were very much
known as the alchemists,

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:84%
whether it was working
with herbs or metallurgy

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
or the vibrational energies in
general, the wisdom harnessing

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:90%
the stars.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
All the alchemists
of Europe, who

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
wanted to learn from
the wisest masters,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:84%
went to Egypt to learn
their trade, their arts.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:10%
>> The word "alchemy" actually
comes from "al-Kemet."

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:10%
And Kemet was the
ancient name for Egypt.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
It was the pre-diluvian
name for Egypt.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So from Kemet, we get
"alchemy," and from "alchemy,"

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
we actually get the
word, "chemistry."

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
things are related,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
but they all go back to the
sacred science of ancient Egypt.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:10%
>> As we follow the
footsteps of Imhotep,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.490 align:middle line:10%
the great polymath and
architect of the Djoser Pyramid,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:10%
we're following his trail
of influence into Memphis,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:10%
into Saqqara, into the
various temples in the region,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:10%
where they were
studying, practicing,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.460 align:middle line:10%
and bringing new healing art
modalities into the world

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:10%
through an order that they
called the order of therapeutae.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
This was a group of priests
and metallurgists and healers

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and alchemists all
practicing the healing arts,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
which is what therapeutae
is, the origin of the word

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
"therapeutic" or "therapy,"
meaning "healing."

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
They were exploring
different magical elixirs.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
They were delving into the
deeper secrets of alchemy,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
not only to increase
the health and vitality

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and healing of the body, but to
take it to an ascended state,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
to take it to a higher
state of being so that you

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.490 align:middle line:90%
could live like the gods.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
You could be like the gods,
not only in life and vitality,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:90%
but continuing to the afterlife.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Imhotep was known by
the Greeks as Asclepius,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:10%
and, in fact, it was believed
that he developed alchemical

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:10%
sciences having to do with
immortality and longevity,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:10%
and that he brought these from
Memphis, the area of Egypt,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:10%
into Greece.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And according to mythology,
Zeus actually had him killed.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, it was believed he learned
these things from Hermes

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
himself, who was believed
to be the father of alchemy,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.800 align:middle line:90%
according to the tradition.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the sciences
that he developed,

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
that he brought
into Greece actually

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
became the practices
for the therapeutae

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:90%
who were living there.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The order of the therapeutae
are an extraordinarily important

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:10%
group.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.700 align:middle line:10%
They have within their name
Ptah, the healers of "Peutah"

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.120 align:middle line:10%
or Ptah.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:10%
And this is a line
of soul healers

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:10%
that begins, actually, in Egypt,
but finds its way back to Egypt

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.040 align:middle line:10%
through India.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
When the city of Alexandria was
being built by the Ptolemaic

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Kings, the successor of
Alexander the Great, King Ashoka

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:84%
from India dispatched
his healers

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, the
therapeutae, to Alexandria

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
to meet up with the
Jewish mystics, as well

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:84%
as mystics that came from
Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Throughout that
part of the world,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.830 align:middle line:84%
there was this
awesome convergence

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
of all of these
alchemical scholars

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and light body scholars
that met in Alexandria.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of them ultimately draw
a line to the mysteries of Ptah

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:90%
at Saqqara.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> With little evidence of
the temples and laboratories

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
remaining above the
sacred sands of Saqqara,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:84%
the search for clues leads back
to a famous biblical relic.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:10%
In 2003, Laurence Gardner
released the book,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:10%
Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:10%
In this astounding
achievement, Gardner

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:10%
questioned everything
we have been

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:10%
taught about the sacred
Ark of the Covenant,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:10%
and provided alchemical evidence
of our ancient ancestors'

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:10%
ability to bend the
rules of reality.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Laurence Gardner produced
an absolute revelation when it

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:10%
comes to the ancient
Egyptian science of human

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:10%
transfiguration.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
This book came on the heels
of his runaway bestseller,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Bloodline of the Holy Grail, and
also Genesis of the Grail Kings.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
In both of those books,
Laurence was hugely interested

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:90%
in human DNA.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
In his book, Lost Secrets
of the Sacred Ark,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Laurence Gardner started to
focus on the Israelite or Hebrew

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
legends about manna, this
mysterious substance that

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:90%
fell out of the sky.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Moses was said to have been
able to make it or identify it

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.350 align:middle line:90%
or even to produce it.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
As Laurence pulls
on the thread, he's

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
led back to the
ancient Egyptians.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:10%
And he's, in particular, led to
a discovery made by Sir Flinders

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:10%
Petrie in 1904, at
a temple dedicated

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:10%
to the Egyptian goddess,
Hathor, at a place called

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:10%
Serabit el-Khadim.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
When he arrives there, he
finds these temple scenes,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and he's led into the inner
sanctum, a cave-like structure

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
devoted to Hathor, where he
locates what he describes

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
as tons of this mysterious white
powder substance that apparently

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:84%
had been manufactured
at Serabit el-Khadim.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Another thing that Laurence
Gardner pointed out is that Sir

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Flinders Petrie found crucibles
on top of the mountain

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.230 align:middle line:90%
of the Serabit el-Khadim.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.390 align:middle line:84%
What a crucible is
is it's basically

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
like a giant pot
that can withstand

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:90%
extremely high temperatures.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.855 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you calcinate
or you burn things down.

00:08:03.855 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
He suggests that this was
a manufacturing plant.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.020 align:middle line:84%
It was an alchemical plant
that was happening there.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Laurence realizes that what
he's potentially dealing with

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
in this line of research is
gold that had been transfigured

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:90%
into powder.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And as he continues
on this path,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
he runs up against
modern science

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
that tells us that this white
powder gold, as it's described,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:84%
can interface with
human DNA, making

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.700 align:middle line:84%
it many thousands of
times more superconductive

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.552 align:middle line:90%
than in its natural state.

00:08:40.552 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout the temples
and the tombs in Egypt,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:84%
we very clearly see references
to the pharaohs and those

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
in high position being given
or being offered a substance.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:10%
According to the
hieroglyphs, this

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:10%
is a substance that promotes
longevity, promotes healing,

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:10%
and allows them
powers that those

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:10%
who have not ingested the
substance don't seem to have.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:10%
The question is, what
is that substance?

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.330 align:middle line:10%
There has been
speculation for years

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:10%
that it is gold, a form of
gold, called monatomic gold.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
When we see the temple
walls, the pharaohs

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.300 align:middle line:84%
are being offered a
pyramidal-shaped substance,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and it is within that substance
that the monatomic gold

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.290 align:middle line:90%
is believed to exist.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Originally, in ancient Egypt,
what they did is they figured

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
out how to extract
these monatomics,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and they would bake it into
bread for the pharaoh to eat.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
This monatomic gold that was
being ingested by the pharaohs

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
was actually helping them
not only raise their health,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
but also to have access to
different densities of reality,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to unite
what they believed

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.330 align:middle line:90%
was with their ancestors.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.940 align:middle line:10%
In the Egyptian Book of the
Dead or the Egyptian Book

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:10%
of Coming Forth
by Light, it talks

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:10%
about the pharaoh
receiving these things

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:10%
as part of his journey
to the afterlife.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:90%
It says, "I am white.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:90%
I am pure.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.610 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.830 align:middle line:90%
I provide health and long life.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:90%
What is it?"

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:10%
Well, it just so happens in
Hebrew, the word "manna,"

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.910 align:middle line:10%
which is what this
substance is, that "manna"

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:10%
in Hebrew actually
means, "What is it?"

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a suggestion
that the alchemical process

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:10%
to produce this gold was
actually not just at Serabit

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.960 align:middle line:10%
el-Khadim in the
Sinai Peninsula.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It was also found in
the area around Memphis

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
linked to the priests of Ptah
or the order of therapeutae.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, in fact, the tradition
of creating this gold

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
may have been found
all over Egypt.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the whole
idea of alchemy really coming

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:90%
to the fore in ancient Egypt.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of producing
monatomic elements,

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:90%
there's two ways.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:84%
One way is to extract
them, and you extract them

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
by calcinating down
vegetable matter to ashes.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Then you subject it to
certain acids and lyes,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to get
the monatomic elements

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:90%
to precipitate out.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:84%
The other way to do it is
to convert platinum metals

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.810 align:middle line:90%
into this monatomic state.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
This usually requires
electricity, high arcs,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:90%
as well as acids to do it.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians could have done
either based on the technology

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:90%
that we believe they inherited.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> "monatomic," first of
all, means "single atom."

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.470 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
exotic matter, which

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
is what is hypothesized
around the monatomic elements,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
in an altered state,

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
there naturally.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
They, in a way, almost had to
be purified and transformed

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and taken through the
alchemical process.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, the alchemists
would have started with gold,

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:84%
and they would have
taken that gold

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
through the alchemical stages
and various purification.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
They would have
submitted it to fire.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:84%
They would have tried to purify
and get all of the impurities

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
out, and to the point
where they could get it

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:84%
where fire no longer did
anything to the element.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they
said it was perfected.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:10%
When it was in this
perfected form,

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:10%
there are some alchemists,
including Nicolas Flamel,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:10%
for example, that were
quoted as saying it was not

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:10%
a stone but a white powder.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient
Egyptians were said

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:84%
to have been creating this white
powder, this monatomic gold,

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
starting from gold, but then
it became something else.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was said that
this was the true manna

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.980 align:middle line:84%
or the shem-an-na, the
bread of light and of life,

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and that this was fed
to the Egyptian pharaohs

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and the high initiates to
help them become enlightened.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:10%
>> The Egyptian name for the
substance was actually mfkzt.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:10%
When the Templars went into
Egypt and started studying

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:10%
the temple walls, and they
started studying the alchemical

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:48.590 align:middle line:10%
practices, what we now know is
that this force called "world

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.550 align:middle line:10%
spirit" is actually ignitons,
which are very small

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:10%
quasiparticles that are
transmitted by active stars.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:10%
It was believed that this
monatomic gold actually

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:10%
attracted the world spirit
to it or the ignitons.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:10%
It was like a magnet
for the ignitons.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Now that we know this
world spirit is ignitons,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.040 align:middle line:84%
we decided we needed
to do modern testing.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do this, we sent
monatomic gold to Switzerland

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
to be tested in a
modern lab so that we

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
could determine if these
ignitons were really there.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is that,
actually, the monatomic gold

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.590 align:middle line:84%
was loaded with ignitons,
suggesting that it really

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.910 align:middle line:90%
was a great attractor for them.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:90%
It was a magnet for them.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.493 align:middle line:84%
Thereby, if you're actually
ingesting this monatomic gold,

00:14:47.493 --> 00:14:48.910 align:middle line:84%
what you're really
doing is you're

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
taking in all these
loaded ignitons.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.520 align:middle line:84%
This is what's
contributing to health,

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and it's what's contributing to
the raising of consciousness,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.390 align:middle line:84%
just like the ancient
temple walls suggested.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The Templars, as they learned
the alchemical practice

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.910 align:middle line:84%
for creating monatomic
gold, started

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
to bake this monatomic gold
into their bread, particularly

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:middle line:84%
their bread that was
turned into communion

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
wafers for the sacrament
that they were serving.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were known
for living very long.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
It was believed that some of
it had to do with their diet,

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
but some of it had
to do with ingesting

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:84%
these white cakes
of monatomic gold,

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
just like the pharaohs had in
Egypt, that were attracting

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.420 align:middle line:90%
the ignitons to them.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.400 align:middle line:10%
The grand master,
Jacques de Molay,

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:10%
who was burnt at the stake
in 1314, he was in his 70s,

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:10%
when most people only
lived to 30 in those days.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:10%
So we now know
this is absolutely

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:10%
what was contributing to
their long life and the reason

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:10%
why they were living so
much longer than everybody

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:10%
else during that time.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the interesting
features about when monatomic

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
gold is being produced is
that 44% of it disappears.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:84%
No one knows where it
goes, and some people

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
have suggested it actually
goes to another dimension.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians called
it the field of mfkzt.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And so this is like the kind
of other dimensional connection

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:90%
we have with this gold.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So they thought that
when you take it,

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
you're connecting with this
other dimensional reality.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look to cultures
all over the world,

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.180 align:middle line:84%
ancient cultures, to these
magical substances that bring

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.460 align:middle line:84%
an ascended state of being, a
higher state of enlightenment,

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.790 align:middle line:84%
we are not only seeing mfkzt
formed out of gold in Egypt,

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.480 align:middle line:84%
but we are finding, in
the Greco-Roman tradition,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.130 align:middle line:84%
ichor and ambrosia, the food
of the gods that let them live

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:84%
in this higher
state of vitality.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
We find in the Vedic and
Hindu traditions, soma,

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:84%
which brings you also into
the higher ascended state.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back to
the Norse tradition,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.490 align:middle line:84%
we find Idunn and
her golden apples,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:84%
that when the gods eat these
apples, they have eternal life.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
They have youthful
vitality and strength.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting that
these apples are golden, just

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.160 align:middle line:84%
like the monatomic
gold of mfkzt,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.730 align:middle line:90%
the bread of the pharaohs.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Laurence Gardner was one
of the first people to connect

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
monatomics with the
esoteric tradition.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:90%
Laurence Gardner was a Templar.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:31.020 align:middle line:84%
He was a Knight Templar, and
he learned of this process

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
through the Templar
tradition because Templars

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:90%
were passing on this tradition.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:84%
They originally learned
of it from certain members

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
of the Coptic church, the
Sabians and the Druze,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
all who had passed on this
alchemical tradition from Egypt.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
Templar order got it.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:84%
That's where Laurence
Gardner learned of it.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Laurence had some fascinating
things to say about this

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.070 align:middle line:90%
monatomic gold.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:04.890 align:middle line:10%
He said that it was produced by
taking gold, and then entering

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:10%
it into a high spin state,
so that it would literally

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:10%
enter into this field or
dimension of the blessed,

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.540 align:middle line:10%
as it was called,
and be transformed

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:10%
and that in its
transformed state,

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:10%
it had these incredible
properties of levitation,

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:10%
anti-gravity, and that it could
even convey those qualities

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:10%
to other objects.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.790 align:middle line:84%
As he continues
his investigation,

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.780 align:middle line:84%
he realizes that
the technology that

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.230 align:middle line:84%
could be utilized to produce
this white powder substance

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
is the biblical Ark of the
Covenant, which is thought

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:90%
of as a communications device.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
In the Old Testament stories,
the Old Testament god, Yahweh,

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
would manifest on the mercy
seat of the Ark of the Covenant

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.000 align:middle line:84%
as this luminous humanoid
figure surrounded

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:90%
by rainbow-colored light.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But the Ark of the
Covenant also had

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:84%
these electrical
capabilities as well.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It was thought to
have been radioactive.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
It's thought of even
as a weapon system.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> One question that comes up
when it comes to this monatomic

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.520 align:middle line:84%
gold is, how does it get
to this high spin state?

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:84%
How does it get to this place
of becoming exotic matter?

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
studies that have

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
been done on it
in modern day have

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:84%
shown that you need to
provide a high temperature

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.960 align:middle line:90%
current of electricity.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, an
arc has been applied

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to the gold or the
platinum to heat it up

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.550 align:middle line:84%
to temperatures that
are equivalent to what

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:90%
you would find on the sun.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the arc is providing this
high temperature, high energy

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:84%
state that is pumping all
of this energy density

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.140 align:middle line:84%
into the atom,
which is then part

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:84%
of what transforms the atom
into a new exotic state.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:84%
We know from astrophysics
that within stars, this is

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:90%
the birthplace of higher atoms.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
The stars are
alchemical furnaces

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that allow for the atoms
to build up from hydrogen

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:19.215 align:middle line:90%
to helium to oxygen, carbon.

00:20:19.215 --> 00:20:21.590 align:middle line:84%
All of these higher elements
that we have in the universe

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.886 align:middle line:90%
come from stars and supernova.

00:20:23.886 --> 00:20:25.850 align:middle line:90%
[EXPLOSION]

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:84%
So there's plasma physics
that starts coming in.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
There's high energy physics
that starts coming in.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
There's nuclear and quantum
and all of these higher physics

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
elements come in when you reach
these temperatures in the stars.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's been hypothesized
that the Ark of the Covenant

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
was something that could
also create such an arc.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
The positive pole and
the negative pole,

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.150 align:middle line:84%
the cherubim coming
across was where

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that point of almost connection,
where the current could leap

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:90%
across and create this arc.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And then if some gold
was placed in that,

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
it would then transform
it into the white powder

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:90%
or into the monatomic.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What's so interesting
about this, too,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
is that they talk about the Ark
of the Covenant as being a most

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.390 align:middle line:90%
holy device.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:84%
The difference between something
that is holy and something that

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.460 align:middle line:84%
is most holy, like the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.470 align:middle line:84%
is that the Ark of the Covenant
could convey or transpose

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
an unholy object into a most
holy object or holy object.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's consistency
here with what Laurence

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
is saying with the monatomic
gold in ancient Egypt

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and what the Bible says about
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> In his book, Laurence makes
a very interesting observation

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.380 align:middle line:84%
about the etymology of the
word, "ark," spelled A-R-K.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
He notes that the Latin "A-R-K"
comes from the Greek "A-R-C,"

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.300 align:middle line:84%
phonetically the
same, but A-R-C,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
arc refers to a
box or a container.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.480 align:middle line:10%
He goes on to note that the
Latin and the Greek ark, A-R-K,

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:10%
A-R-C, then goes into French,
and it becomes arche, A-R-C-H-E.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time arc
gets into English,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and ark, A-R-K, is a
boat, like Noah sailed in.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a method of transportation.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Arc, A-R-C, is something
that electricity does.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:90%
It makes an arc.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.132 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, that's what the
Ark of the Covenant did as well.

00:22:37.132 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So now we seem to be going in
circles here, but not really.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.548 align:middle line:84%
We're just getting into
the heart of the matter

00:22:41.548 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
here that the Ark
of the Covenant

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:90%
was a transportation device.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It was a boat of the gods.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.780 align:middle line:84%
They could use it to teleport
throughout the cosmos.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.730 align:middle line:90%
It was a container.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It is a source of mysteries
and hidden secrets.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's an electrical device.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Moses's brother,
Aaron, had two sons

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:84%
who were killed by
bolts that emerged

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:90%
from the Ark of the Covenant.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So it very clearly was
an electrical device

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and was capable of
producing an electrical arc.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> As the mysteries mount
around the power and purpose

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.220 align:middle line:84%
of the legendary
Ark of the Covenant,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:23.050 align:middle line:84%
new questions arise around the
connection with this sacred

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:90%
device and monatomic alchemy.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The Templar
order, to this day,

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
still extracts
monatomic elements.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.700 align:middle line:84%
They use them primarily in,
like, a communion ritual

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
that they do, where it
represents the bread

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.120 align:middle line:90%
during the communion ritual.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:47.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you go to the
Temple of Seti I at Abydos,

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
there is a chamber that's
closed to the public.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:84%
What's significant
about that chamber,

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
though, is on the
temple walls of that

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:84%
chamber is a depiction of an
ark undergoing transportation.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It also shows an ark not
under transportation,

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's Templar
graffiti from the 1200s,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:84%
these red Templar crosses
emphasizing that ark.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.960 align:middle line:10%
According to our
tradition, that chamber

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:10%
was one of the chambers where
the Templar order recovered

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.130 align:middle line:10%
one of six arks that are
currently in our possession.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:26.640 align:middle line:10%
So Laurence Gardner-- part
of his work was to bring--

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.460 align:middle line:10%
start to bring to the
attention of people

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:10%
this connection
between these arks

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:34.060 align:middle line:10%
and these monatomic elements.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But we continue, to this
day, to utilize these things.

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the theories about
the Ark of the Covenant is that

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the superconductive qualities
that are supposed to be

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
associated with that, the energy
that it was supposed to have

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
created, it's really intriguing
because some people have

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
suggested this was actually
the crucible itself,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:84%
where monatomic
gold was created.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It was alchemically
produced, somehow,

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:90%
in the Ark of the Covenant.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the case, this
is really, really intriguing

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:84%
because not only do we
have the idea that there

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
was more than one
ark, also that it

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
may have been connected
with the construction

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
of these megalithic
sites and pyramids

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:90%
that we actually find in Egypt.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason being is that
when you create this monatomic

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.770 align:middle line:84%
gold-- and this has been
tested relatively recently--

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
it creates an
anti-gravitational field

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.140 align:middle line:84%
around where it's being
produced at that time.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And so not only are you
producing this sacred kind

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:42.960 align:middle line:84%
of substance, which you
ingest for spiritual purposes,

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.920 align:middle line:84%
but also, you're creating
a field, where you can

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:90%
levitate giant blocks of stone.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> We see examples of this
referred to in the Torah

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.390 align:middle line:84%
or the Old Testament with the
Ark of the Covenant, which,

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
just based on the layers of gold
and acacia wood and everything

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:84%
else that was involved in it,
would have weighed at least two

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.650 align:middle line:90%
tons.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet two people
could carry it

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:84%
with rods, which
doesn't even make sense,

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:84%
unless it's somehow
levitating, or it's somehow

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.660 align:middle line:90%
losing that weight.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you have a quantity
of this monatomic gold,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:84%
and you're sitting next to a
100-ton block of red granite,

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:90%
it could be levitated.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.560 align:middle line:10%
Now, think about that in
light of the mystery of how

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Egyptians were
so effortlessly able to move

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:10%
100-ton-plus blocks of
granite at the Osireion,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.520 align:middle line:10%
at the Valley Temple, in the
King's Chamber of the Great

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:10%
Pyramid.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.320 align:middle line:90%
How did they do this?

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Is this-- is it possible that
this is what they were doing?

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something very
different in the properties

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
of these monatomic elements
that allows them to almost defy.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like we have to go
beyond our known physics now

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to fully explain what
might be happening.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.500 align:middle line:84%
We have to start looking
at the possibility

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.310 align:middle line:84%
of parallel realities, alternate
dimensions, anti-gravity,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
wormholes-- all of
these kinds of things

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:84%
start to become part of
the realm of possibility

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:26.460 align:middle line:84%
when we explore into exotic
matter and its properties.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> As more alchemical mysteries
from ancient Memphis are

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:84%
discovered, what other
evidence will be revealed about

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.620 align:middle line:84%
the powers of gold that helped
the ancient Egyptian pharaohs

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.800 align:middle line:84%
gain deeper access to the
multi-dimensional realms that

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:90%
are beyond our understanding?

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> New discoveries are now
shedding some new light on this

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:90%
concept.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It's still all
about gold, but it's

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:58.000 align:middle line:84%
a different kind of gold called
nanogold, nanoparticle gold.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is fascinating to me
because nanoparticle gold is

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:84%
known-- in the scientific
community, it is accepted.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It is being applied
successfully today

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.460 align:middle line:84%
in a number of
medical applications.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because it is
bioavailable to the human body.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:21.498 align:middle line:84%
If these principles were known
in the time of the pharaohs,

00:28:21.498 --> 00:28:23.290 align:middle line:84%
it would make sense
that it would give them

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary abilities that
those around them don't have.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:31.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, one of the things
that has been discovered

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:38.170 align:middle line:84%
is that nanogold actually helps
the DNA in the replication

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:84%
When we think of DNA, the two
strands that we know today,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.710 align:middle line:84%
the double helix, when
that DNA replicates,

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.230 align:middle line:90%
those two strands come undone.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The term is unzipping,
and they become unzipped.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:10%
And the monatomic gold
could help with that,

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:10%
but the nanogold is documented
with doing precisely this.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
It accelerates the
unzipping of the DNA,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.560 align:middle line:84%
producing more opportunities
to replicate more DNA

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.610 align:middle line:90%
in a shorter period of time.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:18.970 align:middle line:84%
In short, the nanogold
enhances our ability

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.110 align:middle line:84%
to be the best version of our
biological selves, whatever

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:90%
that biology would be.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So whether these are pure humans
or, perhaps, hybrid humans,

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:35.410 align:middle line:84%
as the texts suggest,
whatever biology was there

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:40.860 align:middle line:84%
would benefit from the
nanoparticles of gold.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
the role of gold

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.770 align:middle line:84%
in the past as a
monetary instrument,

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:84%
as an ornament of
beauty, we also

00:29:51.990 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
see that gold has been viewed as
a substance that enhances life.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And as we discover more
about the hidden mysteries

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.700 align:middle line:84%
underneath the Giza
Plateau, we discover

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.760 align:middle line:84%
more of the texts
that have never

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.310 align:middle line:84%
been translated and
deciphered, and we

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:17.490 align:middle line:84%
see more examples of
the intact pyramids that

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.490 align:middle line:84%
have still not been
opened, I think

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to have deeper
insights, greater understanding

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:84%
into precisely how
these principles worked

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and what the manna of the
pharaohs was really all about.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:38.000 align:middle line:90%
