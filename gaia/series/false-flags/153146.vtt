>>RICHARD DOLAN: Hello,
I'm Richard Dolan,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.700 align:middle line:90%
and this is "False Flags."

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.520 align:middle line:10%
We have gone through a season
of historical false flags.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.680 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, we've barely
scratched the surface.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a phenomenon that is
increasing, not dying away.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not that people
are becoming more evil.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Governments and individuals
have always sought power.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle line:84%
What's different about our world
today is the means of power.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
For some groups and
nations, false flags

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:84%
are becoming easier
to do, and so we're

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:84%
seeing them perpetrate
them much more frequently.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.740 align:middle line:84%
In the past few years,
greater and greater numbers

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.280 align:middle line:84%
of researchers are paying
attention to this phenomenon.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, even
prominent political figures

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.740 align:middle line:84%
will openly talk about false
flags as part of our reality

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:90%
these days.

and I can't call it anything

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:10%
other than a provocation, is
being prepared in other parts

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:10%
of Syria, including the
southern suburbs of Damascus,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:10%
where they're, again, preparing
to release some similar

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.765 align:middle line:10%
chemical substances and accuse
the Syrian authorities of using

00:01:13.765 --> 00:01:14.565 align:middle line:10%
them.

00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:10%
But we regard that
any such incident

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:10%
would be reason enough for
a thorough investigation.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.420 align:middle line:10%
We are preparing to make a
formal call to the relevant UN

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:10%
agency in The Hague and call
on the international community

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:10%
to investigate thoroughly
these incidents,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and depending on the results
of the investigation,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:10%
to make informed decisions
and take meaningful action.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Even so,
false flags remain

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
mostly unacknowledged in
our mainstream media, which

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.970 align:middle line:84%
truly has become a straitjacket
of conformist thought.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Within our own
culture and society,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.080 align:middle line:84%
the situation is
rather like the parable

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:90%
of the emperor's new clothes.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Remember that story?

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:84%
No one was brave enough
to point out the obvious

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
until an innocent child said
what everyone was thinking,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and then the whole fake
story came crashing down.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
We live in an
ever-changing world,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
and we can't expect the
future to look like today.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But for now, let's look at
how we got to where we are.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
With false flags, we have
seen continuity and change.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's first look
at the continuity.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
As I pointed out in
our very first episode,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:84%
there are several key
features of most false flags.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.640 align:middle line:10%
First, they are usually designed
to get our attention, usually

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:10%
in a spectacular
and emotional way,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:10%
and definitely
something that induces

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.576 align:middle line:10%
some sort of emotional trauma.

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when we look at
them with some detachment,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:90%
they seem very, very contrived.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Think of the Guy Fawkes
escapade from 1605--

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
they simply catch him in the
room with the explosives,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:84%
ready to blow up Parliament--
or the make-believe attack

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
against Sweden in 1788 by guys
in Russian Cossack uniforms,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
or the spectacular
Reichstag fire of 1933,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
or the Gulf of Tonkin
incident, or of course, 9/11.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
These are spectacular events,
which usually are also

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:90%
heavy with symbolism.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
9/11 was especially
powerful as the symbols

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
of American financial power,
the World Trade Center,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and American military power,
the Pentagon, were attacked.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.800 align:middle line:84%
In all of the cases of these
spectacular and usually

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:84%
symbolic attacks, you find that,
in reality, little to no damage

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:90%
was actually done.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Even with 9/11, despite the
personal tragedy of the day,

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:84%
America's wealth and
power were certainly not

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.484 align:middle line:90%
affected by the attacks.

00:03:30.484 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Those two things were
affected in a much greater way

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:90%
by the wars which followed 9/11.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:10%
A second feature of
these false flags

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:10%
is that they generally received
instant media saturation.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was harder to do
in the very early cases.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But with the arrival
of newspapers,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:84%
it became possible-- with
the arrival of radio and then

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:90%
television, easier still.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, in an age of total
connectivity via smartphones,

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:10%
it is easier still.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:10%
Your headline comes
directly to you,

privately-owned media

work hand-in-glove

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:10%
with the government.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
But the media saturation
occurs usually with one voice,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:84%
very early on,
with talking points

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:84%
among networks that are
entirely interchangeable.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:84%
Third, we find that the
case is quickly closed,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:90%
at least officially speaking.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Guilt is immediately levied,
and that's the end of that--

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.852 align:middle line:84%
no discussion, no argument,
and certainly no nuance.

00:04:24.852 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the
sinking of the Lusitania

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.280 align:middle line:84%
in 1915, or the Soviet
purges of the 1930s,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:84%
or any of the other
examples we have explored,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:90%
we find that a culprit--

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:90%
some would say a patsy--

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:90%
is quickly found.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.370 align:middle line:10%
And even if the culprit
does have something

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.200 align:middle line:10%
to do with the event,
there are usually

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:10%
far deeper complexities
that remain off-limits

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:10%
to public investigation.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:10%
This is related to factor
four of false flags--

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.394 align:middle line:10%

these were all draconian
actions that would never

examples of governments taking

that, really, should always

Who benefits?

00:07:19.592 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I suppose that just because a

apparatus benefits
from these events,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:84%

mean that they

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:90%
by the establishment media.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's very important
to know about.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Not only did we
learn that, straight

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
out of Orwell's "1984," your
TV can be used to spy on you.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, it can,
even when it's off.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:84%
One little trick of the
CIA is that it collects

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.040 align:middle line:90%
malware from around the world--

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Russia, Israel, Iran, North
Korea, France, everywhere.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Wherever it's made, the
CIA collects and keeps it

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:90%
in a kind of library.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Undoubtedly, other nations
do the same, by the way.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:90%
The key part of this--

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:84%
such malware can then
easily be inserted

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle line:84%
into a cyber-attack, which
cyber experts would eventually

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:90%
be able to identify.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:84%
That's Russian malware,
or that's Iranian malware,

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.726 align:middle line:90%
they would correctly say.

00:15:11.726 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
What they wouldn't
be able to say

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.120 align:middle line:84%
is that the CIA itself inserted
the malware, specifically

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to smear those nations, because
as any cyber expert will tell

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
you, it is fundamentally
impossible to determine

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
the source of nearly
any cyber-attack.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.660 align:middle line:84%
The reason is for
precisely this reason--

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.060 align:middle line:84%
masking one's
identity is very easy

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:84%
these days if you know
what you're doing.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And inserting code
that would appear

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to be the fingerprints
of another nation,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:90%
that's also very easy.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So the next time
you hear a claim

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of some new international
cyber-attack,

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and when your government or
media claim that they just

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
know who was behind
it, it's time

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.412 align:middle line:90%
to be very, very skeptical.

00:15:50.412 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:84%
In all likelihood, they
don't know, and indeed,

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:90%
they cannot know.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:10%
>> What the researchers
are doing here--

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.610 align:middle line:10%
and we're talking about
some of the top researchers

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.420 align:middle line:10%
in the world--

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:10%
are looking at the code.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.099 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I have an
image that I just

00:16:02.099 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:10%
want to put up comparing
the code of WannaCry,

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.415 align:middle line:10%
this ransomware, with code
from another group that's

00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:10%
been linked to North Korea.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:10%
Now, you and I can't make
much sense of that code.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.000 align:middle line:10%
But if you look closely there,
Max, where the red boxes are,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:10%
it's literally copy
and paste, this code.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:10%
So this is what groups like
Symantec, one of the top Google

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:10%
researchers, and
Kaspersky-- we're

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:10%
talking about the
top cyber security

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:10%
researchers in the world--
are going through and looking.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:10%
And they see that
similarity, and they say,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:10%
OK, WannaCry looks
very much like code

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.680 align:middle line:10%
from the Lazarus
group, and this is

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:10%
the group that was linked
to the Sony hacking attack.

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:10%
They are being
very clear-- there

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:10%
is nothing definitive here.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:10%
We are in the early days
of an investigation.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:10%
It could be a false flag
planted by another group.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.170 align:middle line:10%
But these are the first
days of this investigation

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.247 align:middle line:10%
of the whodunit.

00:16:49.247 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: But now, at least,
we do know for certain, not just

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
hunches and guesses,
that faking cyber-attacks

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
from other nations is
something the CIA does.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it goes beyond that.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
They have the ability to hack
into the software of all kinds

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:04.970 align:middle line:84%
of gadgets and
appliances in what's

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:90%
called the internet of things.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.900 align:middle line:84%
That includes
modern automobiles.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
You can reflect on
the implications

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.200 align:middle line:90%
of what that means.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.829 align:middle line:84%
Unsurprisingly, immediately upon
this information coming out,

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:84%
a number of researchers
looked to the death

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.690 align:middle line:84%
in 2013 of the American
journalist, Michael Hastings.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Hastings had done outstanding
investigative work

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.515 align:middle line:84%
for "Rolling Stone" on the
US mission in Afghanistan

00:17:27.515 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and was in the
process of writing

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.700 align:middle line:84%
a major piece on the CIA
director John Brennan.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Hastings had become
worried for his safety.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And at 4:20 AM on
Tuesday, June 18,

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Hastings' silver
Mercedes C250 Coupe,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.630 align:middle line:84%
speeding at a very high speed
in Hollywood, jumped a median,

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:90%
hit a palm tree, and exploded.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it exploded.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.040 align:middle line:84%
The engine of the vehicle was
found hundreds of feet away.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Hastings' body was charred
beyond recognition, identified

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:90%
only by fingerprints.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Military analysts who talked
about how modern vehicles can

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
be covertly commandeered
were ridiculed by the media,

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.460 align:middle line:84%
until now, when we learned
that this capability is real.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the nature of the
new form of false flag--

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.920 align:middle line:84%
highly covert, highly
sophisticated, very,

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.000 align:middle line:84%
very difficult, if not
impossible, to trace.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But false flags can be even
more slippery than this.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you, can a health
scare be a false flag?

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Or let me put it another way--

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:84%
let's look at a few
fundamental realities.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Big pharma rakes in billions
of dollars every year

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.504 align:middle line:90%
selling us drugs.

00:18:32.504 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what they do,
they sell us drugs.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Sure, they will gladly tell
you that they're saving lives

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.684 align:middle line:90%
and making people happier.

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And they have expensive
marketing teams,

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and advertising teams,
and doctors, and lawyers,

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and legislators, and judges in
their pocket to back them up.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So when a new
virus comes along--

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:84%
which happens all
the time, every day,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.150 align:middle line:84%
including new strains of the
influenza virus, the flu--

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is it exactly a false flag
when the next new health scare

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
hysteria comes our way,
because this happens to us

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.640 align:middle line:90%
every single year?

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have flus every year
and people die from them,

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.780 align:middle line:84%
but is that why we get these
annual insertions of hysteria?

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:84%
All of those who make
billions on their vaccines,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
and forgetting for the moment
that they need you to be sick,

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
to what extent is each new
flu that appears little

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:90%
more than fear-mongering hype?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Why worry about oregano oil,
olive leaf, ginger, probiotics,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:84%
honey lemon tea,
vitamins, and good hygiene

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
when you or your
insurance provider

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.460 align:middle line:84%
can drop more money into
the coffers of big pharma?

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt that
we are being played.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But are these flu
scares false flags?

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's call it a gray area.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:84%
There are health scares that
I think qualify absolutely

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:90%
as false flags.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.242 align:middle line:84%
There are a few
things to look for.

00:19:46.242 --> 00:19:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Like any other
false flag, you want

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
to look for instant
coordinated media attention

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to kickstart what's basically
a health scare marketing

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.575 align:middle line:90%
campaign.

00:19:54.575 --> 00:19:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's pretty common
these days since our news media

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.535 align:middle line:90%
is totally coordinated.

00:19:58.535 --> 00:20:01.830 align:middle line:84%
But look for evidence of what
the disease actually does,

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.150 align:middle line:90%
rather than the hype.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:84%
In other words, is
it actually deadly,

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:84%
or has it been around
forever and actually gives

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
fairly mild flu-like
symptoms, which you can treat

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:90%
with honey, lemon, and ginger?

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:10%
Remember the swine flu,
otherwise known as H1N1,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:10%
that hit the scene in 2009.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:10%
The media blitz on
it was unbelievable.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.820 align:middle line:84%
People were truly
in mortal terror.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.409 align:middle line:84%
By the spring of '09, there
was a near-global panic.

00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Next, I would like to tell
you about medicines that can be

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.020 align:middle line:10%
used to treat swine flu.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:10%
CDC recommends the use of
Oseltamivir or Zanamivir

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.680 align:middle line:10%
for the treatment and,
alternatively, the prevention

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.136 align:middle line:10%
of infection with these
swine flu viruses.

00:20:40.136 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Later, a prominent
German physician and health

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
care official named Wolfgang
Wodarg stated publicly

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
that major firms had
organized a campaign of panic

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.040 align:middle line:84%
to put pressure on the
World Health Organization

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:84%
to declare a false
pandemic to sell vaccines.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:10%
>> To discuss this, we're
now joined live by Dr.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.860 align:middle line:10%
Wolfgang Wodarg, who
initiated this probe.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.250 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Wodarg, you state
that drug firms organized

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.460 align:middle line:10%
a campaign of panic
over pandemic fears

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:10%
when one was not really evident.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.800 align:middle line:10%
What made you come
to this conclusion?

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:10%
>> We didn't judge like
this, but I think we see

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:21.850 align:middle line:10%
the necessity that we have
to do some investigations

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.490 align:middle line:10%
in the Council of Europe
to reinstall the trust

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:10%
and the reliability of such very
important organizations like

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:10%
the WHO.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:10%
And I think we have seen that
there are many signs that there

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:10%
is a close cooperation between
pharmaceutical companies

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.395 align:middle line:10%
and the WHO.

00:21:42.395 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He
said, this campaign

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:84%
began in May, 2009,
in Mexico City

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
when 100 or so
normal flu cases were

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
declared to be the
beginning of a new pandemic.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he said there was
little scientific evidence

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.380 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.960 align:middle line:84%
Even so, the WHO,
working with big pharma,

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.140 align:middle line:84%
redefined pandemic to
get what they wanted.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:10%
They removed the
statement that, quote,

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:10%
"an enormous amount of people
have contracted the illness

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.060 align:middle line:10%
or died," end quote,
from its definition,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.130 align:middle line:10%
and replaced it by
stating, simply,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:10%
that there has to be a virus
spreading beyond borders

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:10%
and to which people
have no immunity.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say to you
that, personally, I

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
was skeptical the
whole time of H1N1

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.095 align:middle line:84%
and never did get a
vaccination for it.

00:22:23.095 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that swine flu
is still with us, by the way.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.080 align:middle line:84%
WebMD tells us that
after sweeping the globe,

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.045 align:middle line:90%
it's still a danger.

00:22:30.045 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:84%
You just don't
hear much about it

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:84%
because, by and
large, if you get it,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.420 align:middle line:84%
you get a little sick
for a little while,

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:90%
then you get over it.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:84%
As I see it, there are
two aspects of false flags

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that make it especially hard for
most people to challenge them.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
First is the emotional
trauma that these events

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:90%
inflict on us.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
A big part of the
power of the false flag

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is that these traumatic
events become joined early

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:90%
on to our intellect.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.580 align:middle line:84%
That is, something awful
happens, but then here comes

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.170 align:middle line:90%
the explanation.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:84%
From that point on,
most of us become

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:84%
emotionally bonded to
the explanation itself.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a very clever
and very manipulative

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.070 align:middle line:84%
form of conditioning,
and it works.

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
We become resistant to
challenging narratives

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that we ourselves have become
emotionally affected by.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Overcoming that is the first
and hardest and most important

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:90%
step in identifying false flags.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, however,
is the rest of society.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
once we ourselves

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
take the red pill of truth,
how do we navigate our way

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
through society when,
as far as we can tell,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.850 align:middle line:84%
most people have still accepted
the official narrative,

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:84%
in which most of us, after
all, fear social condemnation?

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Throughout history, people
have lost their jobs

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and worse for believing
the wrong things,

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and that includes
today in our country.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.480 align:middle line:84%
There is a tremendous amount
of social pressure exerted

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:84%
on all of us to
believe certain things.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We should not
underestimate that.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:90%
But look at it this way--

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that can be said about every
single transformative belief

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that human beings
have ever held.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Visionaries throughout
history have faced

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:90%
opposition for their insights.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing new.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And we today are indebted to
those brave people of the past

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:90%
who have opened doors for us.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I think a proper
study of false flags

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.480 align:middle line:84%
helps us moving
forward in many ways,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:84%
but one important
way is in teaching us

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:90%
how to evaluate information.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.800 align:middle line:84%
We learn to be active in
the process of learning, not

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:90%
passive recipients.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.960 align:middle line:84%
We learn that digging
deeper pays benefits to us,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.390 align:middle line:84%
enabling us to look
at the world around us

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:84%
with greater maturity
and a deeper perspective.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
False flags are a
part of our world,

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and opening our eyes to them
can help us uncover something

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:84%
inside us, strength
we didn't know we had,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.670 align:middle line:84%
insights that never
came to us before,

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.820 align:middle line:84%
and the courage to evaluate our
beliefs and lives in a way that

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.490 align:middle line:84%
can open the door
for positive change,

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:84%
not just personally,
but for society.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:55.595 align:middle line:90%
