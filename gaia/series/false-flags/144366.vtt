00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Richard Dolan
and this is False Flags.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:17.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:10%
As I discussed in our previous
episode of this series,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.180 align:middle line:10%
false flags are a specific
tool of state propaganda

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.460 align:middle line:10%
and manipulation
designed to achieve

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:10%
ends that would otherwise
be impossible to justify.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I explained what elements
they often contain,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:84%
as well as why, in my
view, they are specifically

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:90%
modern phenomenon.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:90%
That might seem strange to you.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.020 align:middle line:84%
After all, weren't people in the
ancient world just as cunning

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and deceptive, and every
bit as power hungry,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:90%
as people of today?

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.205 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to that
is, yes, they often were.

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
But the ancient
world has left us

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
scant evidence of false
flags, certainly in the way

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:90%
we understand them today.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Now it may be that there were
false flags we will never

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:84%
know about, secret
operations that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:84%
were so successful that
they evaded any suspicion

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:90%
and were never detected.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Sure, that's possible.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
But the fact remains that
the available evidence

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.744 align:middle line:90%
gives us very little to go on.

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
There does not
even appear to have

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:84%
been a great deal of
suspicion of false flags

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
for the vast majority
of the ancient world.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Even so, there are indeed a few
events of our earlier history

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.870 align:middle line:84%
that do look like false flags,
or at least very possible

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.040 align:middle line:90%
false flags.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And they are definitely
worth our investigation.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.780 align:middle line:84%
As you will see, what
is so interesting

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
about them is not
necessarily how similar they

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
were to false flags of
today, although a few of them

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
were, but really, how
very different they were.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Very different.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
By looking at these early
forms of false flags,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I would say we begin to gain
a better understanding of how

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
this phenomenon, one of the
worst forms of manipulation

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and deception in our world,
has developed and evolved

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.940 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with ancient Rome.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you do hear people
talking about false flags

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
as an ancient
phenomenon, you often

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
hear them refer to the
burning of Rome in 64 AD.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
A massive fire began on
the night of July 18th,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and burned out of
control for five days.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Nearly one third of Rome
was burned to the ground,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and much more was
severely damaged.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:84%
There are several ancient
sources of the great fire,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately none of
them are primary sources.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And only one qualifies
as a secondary account.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:90%
In other words, not ideal.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Even so, historians feel that
they have a pretty good handle

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:90%
on the events, if not perfect.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:84%
It appears that
Emperor Nero wanted

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
to build a series
of palaces, which

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:90%
he plan to name Domus Aurea.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
This structure would have
required a large part of Rome

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to be torn down, and the
Senate rejected the idea.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:10%
Then, luckily for Nero, the
fire cleared much of the area

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:10%
that his project required.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
People knew of Nero's
plans for the Domus Aurea,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and as a result, rumors
spread that he helped

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:84%
to start the fire, either
by openly sending men out

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.860 align:middle line:84%
to do the job, or by
secretly sending them

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
out where they
pretended to be drunk

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:90%
and then set fire to the city.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
If you read what
modern historians have

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:84%
to say about this, they
generally discount the idea.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.200 align:middle line:10%
Most seem to rely on the
most prestigious historian

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:10%
of ancient Rome, named
Tacitus, and agree with him

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:10%
that Nero was probably
in the city of Antium,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.230 align:middle line:10%
about 30 miles south of Rome,
when the fire broke out.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that fire
was a constant menace

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:90%
in ancient cities.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the great fire
also damaged Nero's own palace,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and he appears to have
rushed back from Antium

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:90%
to organize a relief effort.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
He opened his palaces
to let in the homeless,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and had food supplies
delivered to survivors.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:84%
It's also said that
in the aftermath,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Nero devised a new
urban development

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:84%
plan that would make Rome
less vulnerable to fire.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.550 align:middle line:84%
He also, however, gave
himself a huge tract

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
of city property with
the intention of building

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:90%
his new palace there.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So, with Rome rife with rumors
that Nero caused the fire,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
it does certainly appear
that Nero found a scapegoat.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
This was the new religious
cult of Christianity, members

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of which met in secret,
refused to worship the emperor,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.350 align:middle line:84%
and looked forward to
the end of the world

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and the destruction
of Rome's power.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Conservative patriotic Romans
looked at these Christians

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:90%
as something like terrorists.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Tacitus tells us that
Nero blamed the fire

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
on the Christians, and
then to appease the public,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
or feed his own
bloodlust, who knows,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:84%
he had them literally fed to
lions in massive spectacles.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Like so many events
in ancient history,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
we will never have
complete information

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:90%
about the great fire of Rome.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
That's just the reality
of the situation.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine, even
after 2000 years,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that Nero might have
played a role in it.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:84%
After all, Tacitus, while a
great historian, and probably

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
the most reliable voice of that
period, was simply one source.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:90%
So we really will never know.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.730 align:middle line:84%
If you think of the elements
that go into a false flag,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
as I discussed in our
very first episode,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that the great
fire has a few of them,

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:90%
but certainly not all.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.420 align:middle line:84%
It was a spectacular
and traumatic event.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And while there was no real
media to speak of back then,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
it is true that Nero seemed,
quickly and conveniently,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.670 align:middle line:90%
to blame the Christians.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
The government also took very
decisive and immediate action.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And Nero certainly did
benefit from the fire.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
However, what we lack is all the
important series of anomalies

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.829 align:middle line:90%
and inconsistencies.

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
There is, in fact, no
evidence that has ever been

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:90%
offered, not even a little.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
The best we can say is that
Nero might have been behind it.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand
fires were very common

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I think the best guess is
that the great fire was

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
a case of what we can call
state opportunism, in which

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
a convenient victim
was offered up

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:84%
as a sacrifice for the
benefit of powerful interests.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Not quite a false flag,
but certainly a case

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:90%
of government treachery.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Now lets look at
the Inquisition.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:84%
The Inquisition lasted for
several centuries in Europe.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a major extended
effort by the Catholic church

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to maintain orthodoxy in a time
when more and more people began

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.262 align:middle line:84%
to question elements
of church dogma.

00:06:30.262 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
After all, we're talking
about the Renaissance,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:84%
the age of world
exploration, the beginnings

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:90%
of true scientific inquiry.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Clearly you're going to get
new ideas entering the world,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's disruptive
for a hierarchy that

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
existed through what can only
be described as mind control.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So in this context,
in the year 1487,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
a very interesting
book was published.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.490 align:middle line:84%
This was the "Malleus
Maleficarum."

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.656 align:middle line:84%
Its title means, the
hammer of witches.

00:06:57.656 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It was really nothing
other than a guide book

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
on how to identify, hunt
down, and kill witches.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:84%
It was extremely
influential, and was

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the cause of a great
amount of human suffering.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was quite effective for
the purposes of the church.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
You create a fake
enemy, witches.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, witches,
in our neighborhood.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing here?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Someone has to
protect the children.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So you terrify the
public about witches.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:90%
But there is a solution.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Kill the witches.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.664 align:middle line:84%
Or rather, find them, and
bring them to the church.

00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:29.080 align:middle line:84%
The church will
take care of them.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:90%
No worries, people.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.440 align:middle line:84%
We will keep you safe
from the witches.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.330 align:middle line:84%
A great benefit for the
church in all of this

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:90%
was the money that it made.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
First, through what were
known as indulgences.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
That is, if one of your
family members was a witch,

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.720 align:middle line:90%
you would pay the church money.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
This could possibly reduce the
sentence, if not in this life,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:84%
then it could help you keep your
wife or daughter out of hell

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and just give her a few thousand
years of nasty purgatory.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And oh yes, the other thing the
church was very good at doing

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
was taking the land of
families of witches.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The Inquisition helped the
church maintain its supremacy

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
over the minds of people
in an era of rapid change,

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:84%
development of scientific ideas,
and exploration of new lands.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.480 align:middle line:84%
You keep them
terrified of witches

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and running to the
church for protection.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.140 align:middle line:90%
Not a bad strategy.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Not good for the
people, but you can

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:84%
see why the church
thought it was awesome.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
It's estimated, by the way, that
over 1 million European women

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:84%
died as a result
of the Inquisition.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:10%
>> By shifting the burdens of
that terror into other people,

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:10%
by making and
constructing otherness,

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:10%
by constructing scapegoats,
in this case witches, or Jews,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:10%
or lepers, who we
can, in a sense,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:10%
blame for the terrible
difficulties of our daily

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.369 align:middle line:10%
existence, from the
catastrophes of history.

00:08:52.369 --> 00:08:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I want to talk a little
bit about the famous Gunpowder

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Plot.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:10%
The 5th of November, known
in Britain as Guy Fawkes Day,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:10%
commemorates the events of
that day from the year 1605,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:10%
known to history as
the Gunpowder Plot,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:10%
or the Gunpowder Treason.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.080 align:middle line:84%
England had been going through
its version of the Protestant

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Reformation, but there
was still strong support

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:90%
in the country for Catholicism.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Many Catholics were still
living in the country.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So there was definite
religious tension.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:10%
According to the official
version of events,

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:10%
a small group of
conspirators planned

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:10%
to assassinate King James
I, who was a Protestant,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.550 align:middle line:10%
and to restore a Catholic
king to the throne.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:84%
The plotters gained
access to a space

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.230 align:middle line:84%
beneath the House of Lords,
and one of these people

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:90%
was named Guy Fawkes.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Fawkes was a major voice for
the rights of English Catholics

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Everyone described him as very
intelligent, very capable,

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:90%
and as a good person.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:90%
Everyone liked Guy Fawkes.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:84%
He was put in charge of the
gunpowder that was stockpiled

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:90%
under the House of Lords.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And remember, gunpowder
in 1605 was not

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
something you would
see every day.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there were
guns and cannons,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
but there were still
many, many swords as well.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Gunpowder was a very
advanced substance,

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and the most powerful explosive
available at that time.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So then came an anonymous
letter to the authorities,

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:90%
warning them of the plot.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Soldiers from the king
searched Westminster Palace

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.850 align:middle line:84%
during the early
hours of November 5th.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.636 align:middle line:84%
There they found Guy Fawkes
guarding the explosives.

00:10:29.636 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
He also had a
pocket watch, which

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
was quite rare at
the time, presumably

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to time his actions
according to the plan.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, Fawkes was tortured,
and he confessed to treason.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.880 align:middle line:10%
The whole event was played up
as the salvation of the country.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
After all, if the
plot had succeeded,

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
King James and the queen
would have been dead,

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
along with the members
of the House of Lords

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.950 align:middle line:90%
and the House of Commons.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, the
exposure of the plot

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:84%
became a national
holiday in the UK.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
deeper story to all

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of this, which has
sometimes been called

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:90%
an English equivalent of 9/11.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
There are suspicious oddities
about the whole affair.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Researchers have argued
that Fawkes was not

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
captured in a basement room
as the official story went.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:10%
Instead, it was said that
he was on a ground floor

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.850 align:middle line:10%
room, which the plotters had
easily been able to rent.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:10%
The anonymous letter, well,
we don't know who wrote it,

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:10%
but we do know who had
it and who used it.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:84%
That was the royal
chancellor, Sir Robert Cecil,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:90%
the Earl of Salisbury.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
This was one of the most
scheming politicians

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
of the age, and a leading
member of the group

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:90%
known as the War Party.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.250 align:middle line:84%
They wanted a war with
Spain, and therefore

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.680 align:middle line:84%
the chance to make
a huge profit.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Cecil was a bit like a man
who would appear much later

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:90%
in history, J Edgar Hoover.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
He ran many spies inside the
Catholic dissident community.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
He was in a position to
know pretty much everything

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.250 align:middle line:90%
worth knowing.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Regarding the
gunpowder plot, Cecil

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
told the nothing
except for the contents

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:90%
of the anonymous letter.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he kept very
close control over information.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting thing is
that, even though Guy Fawkes

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
knew a lot about explosives,
the gunpowder found on the scene

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.620 align:middle line:90%
was not very impressive.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:90%
It was low quality gunpowder.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Today it seems
impossible that even

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
good quality gun powder could
have done any real damage.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And what they found, hardly
at all, it would seem.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And we also have a statement
from a Jesuit historian

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
at the time, a man
named John Gerard.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't published
for 300 years.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Only in 1897 did it come out.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Now Gerard was
obviously pro-Catholic,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:84%
but the main thing
is that he offered

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
a very different, and
we have to say logical,

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:90%
interpretation of November 5th.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
He wrote, quote,
"When we examine

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
into the details supplied
to us as to the progress

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
of the affair, we find that much
of what the conspirators are

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
said to have done is
well nigh incredible.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:84%
While it is utterly
impossible that if they really

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
acted in the manner described,
the public authorities

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
should not have had
full knowledge."

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Gerard was essentially saying,
if this so-called plot were

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:84%
true, then we are looking at
the dumbest plotters in history.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
He was skeptical,
to say the least.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, King James himself was
not particularly anti-Catholic.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of his advisors had told
him the Catholics in England

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:90%
were nearly all loyal.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And there certainly
was no indication

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
that any Catholic nation had
anything to do with the plot.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that
Sir Robert Cecil, who

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.310 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be pulling
many strings on this,

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
did want war with Spain,
and did take a hardline view

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:90%
against Catholics.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:10%
So, immediately after
the plot was revealed,

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:10%
England's churches,
the main avenue

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:10%
of state propaganda at the time,
spun the story to the nation.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.850 align:middle line:84%
The evil Catholics had
tried to kill the king

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and destroy England.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Catholics became seen as
the terrorists of their day,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and persecution
against them increased.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
It also led to a
long period of war

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:84%
between Protestant England
and Catholic Spain.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Like most of the events
of early history,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
we will never know
with certainty

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:84%
all the details of
the Gunpowder Plot,

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's fair to suggest that
Sir Cecil and the War Party

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
either made it happen, or else
allowed the plot to take place,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
knowing it would play
into their hands.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
This seems very much like
later operations of agent

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
provocateurs, in which
people are unwittingly

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:84%
coaxed and cajoled
into attempting

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.820 align:middle line:84%
terroristic activity, then
nabbed in order to perpetrate

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:90%
the need for authority.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Now we turn to the pirates.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.220 align:middle line:84%
It's from these
fellows of history

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.070 align:middle line:84%
that we actually get
the phrase false flag.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Professional historians
tell us false flags were not

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.100 align:middle line:84%
uncommon during the
Golden Age of Piracy,

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:90%
the 17th and 18th centuries.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
During that time, pirates who
roamed the world seas would

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:84%
sometimes catch
their victims off

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
guard by using the flags
of a friendly nation.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It was the simplest
way to capture

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:90%
an unsuspecting merchant vessel.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Before Morse code or
electronic signaling,

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
the only way a ship
could be identified

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:90%
was by the flag it carried.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the 17th
century, national flag designs

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
were well known, and pirates
often collected them.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
British pirates
were known sometimes

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:84%
to fly the Union Jack when
it suited their purposes.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
You would think
that, from a group

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.150 align:middle line:84%
of people whose activities
are the cause of the phrase

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
false flag, that we would
have many false flag

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.770 align:middle line:90%
stories from them.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we have
only a small handful

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:84%
of specific examples
of pirate false flags.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.540 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty sure they
did a number of them,

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
but the details are
generally lost to us.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Most of them seem to date
from the early 1700s.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
One prominent pirate,
Bartholomew Roberts,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
flew Dutch flags and
emulated Dutch signals

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.820 align:middle line:84%
when he captured 14 French
sloops, which came to meet him,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of money on
board, thinking they

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:90%
would purchase slaves from him.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:84%
In 1723, he performed
a classic false flag

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:84%
when he encountered
a Spanish merchant

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:90%
ship in the Bay of Honduras.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:84%
According to one of the
leading experts on pirates,

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
historian David Cordingly,
Roberts' pirates, quote,

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
"hoisted up Spanish
colors and continued them

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.820 align:middle line:90%
till they drew near the sloop.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Then they haul them down,
hoisted their black flag,

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.370 align:middle line:84%
fired a broadside,
and boarded her."

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:84%
This shows an important feature
of the classic false flag.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Before engaging the enemy,
the true pirate flag

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:84%
would be raised and
the intended target

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:84%
would then know who
they were dealing with.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the false flag
was used to lure the victim,

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
but once the true action
began, the pirates always

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.819 align:middle line:90%
revealed their identity.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
There were two main
reasons for this.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:84%
First, it was simply considered
wrong, even perfidious,

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.730 align:middle line:84%
for a pirate vessel
to engage its victim

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:90%
while carrying false colors.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there was a code of honor.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But even more
important, was the fact

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that the pirate flag was itself
an effective weapon, almost

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
always striking fear into
the hearts of men on board

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:90%
the target vessel.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking
though, pirates

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:84%
did not feel the need
to use false flags.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Generally, they had superior
firepower and more men

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:84%
than most other vessels,
certainly more than merchant

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:90%
ships.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were quite
confident in their ability

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:90%
to overwhelm their prey.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Their terrifying
reputation was a bonus.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.420 align:middle line:84%
There are a few known
examples of false colors

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:84%
being used by the US Navy
in its early history.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Although these are
certainly not false flags

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.940 align:middle line:84%
in the classic sense,
as much as they

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
are simply examples of clever
disguise being used in warfare.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.030 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.000 align:middle line:84%
One is the story of the
vessel the USS Revenge

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:90%
from the American Revolution.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Already by 1777,
American cruisers

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
were across the
Atlantic Ocean, trying

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:90%
to carry the war to the British.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.060 align:middle line:84%
One of them, the Revenge,
under the command

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
of Gustavus Conyngham,
captured or burned a number

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
of smaller British
vessels in British waters.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle line:84%
One in desperate need
of refitting, Conyngham

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
boldly led his vessel into
a British port in disguise.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
The ship was refit and
repaired in a British harbor,

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and then left unmolested to
continue carrying on warfare

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:90%
against the United Kingdom.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.450 align:middle line:10%
In 1803, during the
Napoleonic Wars,

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:10%
the American frigate
Philadelphia ran on the rocks

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.910 align:middle line:10%
in the harbor of
Tripoli, and was

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:10%
captured by the people
there, the Libyans.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:84%
The Americans determined
to destroy her.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:10%
Stephen Decatur sailed into the
harbor with a volunteer crew,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:10%
in a little vessel
disguised as a fishing boat.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:10%
The Libyans allowed
the Americans

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:10%
to come close, whereupon
the Americans boarded

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:10%
the Philadelphia, drove off the
crew, set the vessel on fire,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.480 align:middle line:10%
and escaped.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Decatur stayed
until the last minute,

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and was the last American to
leave the burning frigate.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
This daring action
deep in enemy territory

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:84%
proved Americans had the will
to defend themselves and meet

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:84%
threats to the nation
anywhere, a fighting tradition

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:84%
upheld by our sailors and
special operators today.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> These accounts of audacity
and guile can't truly be

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
considered false flags,
but discussing them here is

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:90%
instructive.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Both of the cases relating
to the early American

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Navy, or even the events of the
pirates of that era, the use

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
of false flags was only intended
to lure a targeted enemy

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:84%
into a false sense
of security in order

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish a specific goal.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But these types of false
flags were always considered

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.530 align:middle line:90%
to be a temporary expedient.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
That is, once you no longer
need to fool your enemy,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.710 align:middle line:84%
it was perfectly reasonable
to reveal your identity.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.440 align:middle line:84%
The irony about the
phrase false flag then,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
is that none of the few
examples of false flag

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:16.020 align:middle line:84%
operations from
the 18th century,

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
would really qualify
as false flags today.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:84%
The perpetrators were too
honest, even the pirates.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.480 align:middle line:84%
That time period did
have one event, for sure,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:84%
that absolutely qualifies as
a true, genuine false flag.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:84%
It happened in the year 1788, by
the government of, wait for it,

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Sweden.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Who knew?

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
King Gustav III of Sweden
was an unpopular autocrat.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much everyone was sick
of him, especially the nobility.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:10%
Russia, Sweden's main
rival, was openly

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:10%
supporting his
political opponents,

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.600 align:middle line:10%
and Gustav concluded that war
was only a matter of time.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
He also believed,
like many rulers

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:84%
before and after him,
that a short little war

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:90%
would make him more popular.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:84%
His problem was that,
despite being an autocrat,

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.010 align:middle line:84%
he still needed the parliament
to help declare war.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.100 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't do it alone.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
aspect to this situation

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:84%
was that, just as today,
the major western powers,

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:84%
in this case Great Britain,
the Dutch Republic,

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and the kingdom of
Prussia, basically Germany,

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:90%
were afraid of Russian power.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Back then, Russia was
at war with Turkey

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:90%
and doing very well.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was that a war
in the north with Russia

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
would divert Russian
attention from its war

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.460 align:middle line:90%
in the south with Turkey.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:90%
All very complex.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So these three nations
whispered to Gustav

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:84%
to make an alliance with Turkey,
Russia's enemy, which he did.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:90%
So now Gustav planned for war.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:84%
The problem was that war was not
a popular idea in Sweden, not

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:84%
even among Swedish
generals and officers,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
who were not happy
with their king.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
First, he tried
to provoke a war.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
In June of 1788,
the Swedish fleet

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.590 align:middle line:84%
encountered a Russian
squadron in the Baltic Sea.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:middle line:84%
They chased the
Russians down and nearly

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
started a war then and there,
but the Russian commander

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.050 align:middle line:84%
very intelligently and
diplomatically avoided

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
a conflict, and the
Swedes left empty-handed.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
That's when the Swedes initiated
their false flag operation.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:84%
A head tailor of the
royal Swedish opera

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.410 align:middle line:84%
received an order to sew a
number of Russian Cossack

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:90%
uniforms.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
With these uniforms, the
Swedes staged an attack

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
on June 27, 1788, at the small
Swedish outpost of Puumala,

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.500 align:middle line:90%
near the Russian border.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
part of Finland,

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.300 align:middle line:84%
But Sweden had controlled
Finland for centuries.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.390 align:middle line:84%
The fakery did not work
perfectly, by the way.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Several of the king's critics
learned of the costume story

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and declared that the war
was illegal, which it was.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But their voices
were drowned out

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
by the indignation and
outrage in Stockholm

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the nation.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Gustav always sought to have as
strict control over newspapers

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:84%
as possible, and they
covered the outbreak of war

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:90%
just as he wanted.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Overall, the false flag worked.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.420 align:middle line:84%
It was enough to
convince the parliament

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
to allow Gustav to declare
a so-called defensive war

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.730 align:middle line:90%
on Russia.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for Sweden,
and certainly for Gustav,

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
the war turned out to be
a very costly mistake.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:26.240 align:middle line:84%
It lasted for three years
and Sweden was the big loser.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
The initial public support
for the war didn't last long.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.720 align:middle line:84%
About 22,000 Swedish
soldiers died.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The Finns hatched
their own conspiracy

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to create an independent Finnish
state, with Russian support.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:84%
The nobility's hatred of
Gustav only increased.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:90%
And he was assassinated in 1792.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.340 align:middle line:84%
In a larger sense,
the false flag

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:84%
did work quite well,
if not for the Swedes,

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:84%
than for the western powers
who stood behind Sweden.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Britain, the Dutch
Republic, and Prussia.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Because a Swedish
war with Russia did

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:84%
divert Russian plans to send
its Navy into the Mediterranean.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the war with Sweden

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
did serve the interests
of the Western powers.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it didn't
matter very much.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
The Russians eventually
defeated the Turks anyway.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
Napoleon soon overshadowed

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:84%
everything going on in Europe,
and pretty much redrew the map.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the Swedish false flag of
1788 is a fascinating study.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Its purpose was to generate
domestic and diplomatic support

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:84%
for a war that had
no justification,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.780 align:middle line:84%
but which served the interests
of a small clique in Sweden

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.400 align:middle line:90%
and abroad.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:84%
There were multiple
layers of deception here,

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
one by the Swedish government,
another in the form of strings

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.920 align:middle line:90%
being pulled by foreign powers.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
By the 20th and 21st
centuries, such multiple layers

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
of deception would
develop into an art form.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:10%
>> When Hitler lashed
out at Poland in 1939,

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:10%
the German people followed
him into war without regrets.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:84%
This was the day
Germany had been

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.185 align:middle line:90%
building for and waiting for.

00:25:06.185 --> 00:25:08.569 align:middle line:84%
And with larceny
in their hearts,

00:25:08.569 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
they gloried in the destruction
they were letting loose

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
upon the world.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:15.164 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes facing the truth
can be uncomfortable at first.

00:25:15.164 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:84%
After a little while
at it, however, you

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:90%
will inevitably feel stronger.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:90%
Literally empowered.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, think back to anytime
in your life when you

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.410 align:middle line:90%
had an illusion stripped away.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It was painful at first,
but ultimately you

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.280 align:middle line:90%
were glad you learned the truth.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth
does set us free.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Reaching the truth means
stripping away the illusions

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.770 align:middle line:90%
around us, so don't despair.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Just wake up.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm Richard Dolan.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Join me next time
on False Flags when

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.140 align:middle line:84%
we look at three fascinating
acts of deception.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:84%
The sinking of
the Maine of 1898,

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:84%
the financial scare of 1907,
and the sinking of the Lusitania

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:90%
in 1915.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the modern
age of deception.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:59.915 align:middle line:90%
