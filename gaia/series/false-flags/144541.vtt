00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm Richard Dolan and
this is False Flags.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:16.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:10%
We start with the sinking of the
American battleship, the Maine.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.970 align:middle line:10%
This was a major
event in its day.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:10%
It led directly to the
Spanish-American war

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.290 align:middle line:10%
and America's conquest of Cuba,
Guam, and the Philippines.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But despite its importance
in world history,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:84%
the explosion that sank this
battleship is still a mystery.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, it's
often been considered

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to be a false flag, or at
least a possible false flag,

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.280 align:middle line:84%
done by the United States
as a way to justify the war.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Cuba had been a colony
of Spain for a long time.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:84%
But by the late
1800s, Spanish power

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
was, well, not what
it had once been.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:90%
The Cubans hated Spanish rule.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Many Americans supported
Cuban independence

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and of course,
Americans wanted to make

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:90%
some money on that island.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So by 1898, the situation
was extremely tense.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Violent riots were common,
the whole situation

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:90%
was ready to explode.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.440 align:middle line:84%
In that context, the
US sent a battleship

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
into Cuba's Havana
Harbor in January 1898.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.400 align:middle line:10%
That was the Maine.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's no mystery
why this happened.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
President William McKinley,
who wanted to avoid war,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
saw that the Spanish had
lost control of the island.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The Spanish governor
was a man named

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.280 align:middle line:84%
General Weyler, who was
a brutal despot only

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:90%
making things worse.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
McKinley sent the Maine to
protect the American citizens

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:84%
on the island,
that's what he said,

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:84%
along with the American
sugar industry located there.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:90%
He called it a goodwill mission.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Just three weeks later,
on February 15th, 1898,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.575 align:middle line:84%
an explosion rocked
the Maine while it

00:01:57.575 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:90%
was docked in the harbor.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:10%
266 crew members were
killed, only 89 survived.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:84%
The entire forward 1/3 of
the ship was destroyed,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
mainly where the
ammunition was stored,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:84%
more than five tons
of powder charges

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:90%
for the ship's big guns.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:84%
What remained of the ship sank
to the bottom of the harbor.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:10%
So what caused the explosion?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:90%
That's been the question.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Was it caused by some
accident within the ship

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.790 align:middle line:90%
or was sabotage involved?

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.310 align:middle line:90%
And if so, who did it?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
President McKinley
immediately ordered

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:90%
an official investigation.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:84%
It was known as
the Sampson Board.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
The Sampson Board concluded that
sabotage seemed the most likely

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
cause, probably from a
mine in the harbor, which

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.860 align:middle line:84%
would have triggered a larger
explosion in the ship's

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:90%
forward magazines.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Witnesses had heard two
explosions and part of the keel

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.550 align:middle line:84%
was bent inwards, as if
from an external force.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But the Sampson Board did not
assign guilt to any group,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:90%
like the Spanish government.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The American press,
on the other hand,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
immediately pointed
fingers at Spain,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
especially the tabloids--
the so-called yellow press--

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:84%
which was cheap, widespread,
and very influential

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:90%
over mass public opinion.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's interesting.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:84%
These newspapers were
very sensationalist, OK.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But they had more money
and more resources

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.876 align:middle line:84%
than establishment papers
like the New York Times.

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
The New York World,
for instance,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:84%
owned by Joseph Pulitzer;
and the New York Journal,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
owned by William
Randolph Hearst,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.310 align:middle line:84%
both of these newspapers sent
more journalists to the scene,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
provided more detailed
coverage of the event

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:90%
than did the New York Times.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
To this day, their
information is invaluable

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and has been used by later
investigators ever since.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But they also had an agenda,
and that agenda was war.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And that meant focus
on Spanish treachery.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
The tabloids whipped the
public into a frenzy.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a slogan on everyone's
lips, remember the Maine,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:90%
to hell with Spain.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Before long, America was
at war with Spain, quickly

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.282 align:middle line:84%
defeated them, and gobbled
up many colonial prizes.

00:04:11.282 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, Spain did its
own investigation.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want a war with
America, that's for sure.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, they
concluded the explosion

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
was an accident, an explosion
in the Maine's coal bunker,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.480 align:middle line:84%
which then ignited
the ammunition.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Too bad for the
Spanish investigators

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't really get
too close to the ship

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
since the Americans
wouldn't let them.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
In 1911, the US got
another look at the Maine

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.900 align:middle line:84%
when they removed it
from Havana Harbor.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:84%
A new investigation came
to the same conclusion

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
as the Sampson Board, an
external explosion, probably

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
a mine.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
But this was 1911, not the
war-crazed atmosphere of 1898.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that by
1911, no one was really

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:84%
believing that the Spanish
government had been behind it.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:90%
It really never made sense.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Spain gained
nothing from the war

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and knew beforehand
that they had no chance

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
to defeat the Americans.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:90%
Why would they do it?

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So for years, this was
where matters stood--

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
in this hazy it was
probably a mine,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.660 align:middle line:84%
maybe it was Spain, but
maybe someone else category.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.660 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, there
were a few more studies

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:84%
that supported the
sabotage theory.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The best researchers
could do was

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:90%
to guess at who was behind it--

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:84%
maybe some Cubans
who wanted America

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
to fight Spain, maybe a crazed
faction of Spanish officers

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.375 align:middle line:84%
loyal to General Weyler,
the brutal governor.

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But one study of
the 1970s concluded

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
that the explosion
was an accident caused

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.360 align:middle line:84%
by an internal
fire and explosion.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what the
Spanish investigators

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:90%
had originally concluded.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.840 align:middle line:84%
This was known as
the Rickover Study,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:84%
after the retired
US Admiral Hyman

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Rickover who organized it.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Ever since, this has been more
or less the dominant theory

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.520 align:middle line:84%
regarding the
sinking of the Maine.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:90%
But is it true?

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 1995, the
Smithsonian Institution

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:84%
published a study which strongly
supported the sabotage theory.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:84%
By this time, they actually
had new information, long

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:84%
lost testimony from
what they described

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:90%
as an unimpeachable witness.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
This was Alexander Bryce,
an American diplomat

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:90%
from that time.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Bryce had given testimony in
1911 but was basically ignored.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
He had been in Cuba for many
years as an American diplomat.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.330 align:middle line:84%
He had an extensive
network of informants.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
One of these informants was
a former Spanish officer

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:84%
who told Bryce just days
before the explosion

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that the fanatic officers
loyal to the brutal governor

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
General Weyler were planning
to blow up the Maine.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have details but knew
it was going to happen soon.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.840 align:middle line:84%
This is basically
where we stand today.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I have looked into this
as carefully as I can,

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
including reading some
of the technical studies.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
My assessment is that the Maine
was the victim of sabotage,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:90%
all right--

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:84%
that is, a mine
planted in the harbor.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
If we were simply to look
at the strongest evidence,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
we would have to conclude
that the so-called Weylerites,

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
the crazed Spanish
officers, were behind it.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
If so, what a very, very
bad decision they made.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
For the sinking of the
Maine to be a false flag,

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
it would have to have been
caused by the Americans

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and there's never been any
evidence offered for this.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Accusations?

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sure.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, a few.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The government of
Cuba, for example,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:90%
still blames the Americans.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:84%
In the late '90s, an official
at the Havana City Museum

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:84%
stated it as the US just using
a pretext to intervene in Cuba.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
There is even a plaque
near the site that

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
describes the dead
sailors as victims

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
of quote "imperialist greed
in its effort to take over

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:90%
the island of Cuba," end quote.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Some web-based
researchers also accuse

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
the US of being behind
the ship's sinking.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
One person accused
Theodore Roosevelt,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
then assistant
secretary of the Navy,

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
of ordering the Maine to
Havana behind his boss' back--

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:84%
that is, behind President
McKinley's back.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
But sorry, it didn't
happen like that.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.355 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yes, Roosevelt
wanted war, no question.

00:08:18.355 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
But McKinley ordered the
Maine into the harbor.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt later ordered
US battleships into action

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.560 align:middle line:84%
into the Philippines,
not to Cuba.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Teddy Roosevelt,
implacable foe of monopolies,

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:84%
was a staunch advocate of
military preparedness under

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:84%
the foreign policy which
he called speaking softly

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and carrying a big stick.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The sinking of the Maine did
play perfectly into the hands

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:84%
of American imperialists
eager for conquest.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:84%
They manipulated public
opinion for their purposes,

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
they learned that the
public responds well

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:90%
to shocking events--

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:90%
that is, very obediently.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that
lesson was lost.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:84%
Even though we can't call
the sinking of the Maine

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:84%
a false flag, it offered
good training material

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.460 align:middle line:90%
for the future.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It contained several key
elements that became important

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.010 align:middle line:90%
for future false flags.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.270 align:middle line:84%
First, the dovetailing of state
goals with media propaganda.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:10%
Second, the immediate
identification of a culprit

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:10%
and a call for violent action--

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.970 align:middle line:10%
not by the government,
though, but by the press.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Also, we see the
creation of slogans

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:84%
as a way to control and
energize the public.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
There were no covert
ops teams here

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and no direct control
over the media message,

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:84%
those developments were
still in the future.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, false flags don't
have to include explosions

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and dead bodies,
but they do include

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:90%
fear and money and power.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.530 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I'm talking about
the financial scare of 1907.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
In mid-October of that
year, a financial panic

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.160 align:middle line:90%
shook Wall Street investors.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:84%
The stock market
dropped 50% from where

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:90%
it had been a year before.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
All this led to the creation
of the Federal Reserve Bank

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:90%
just a few years later.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.460 align:middle line:84%
According to
conventional history,

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.700 align:middle line:84%
the panic was triggered
by a failed scheme

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to corner the stock of
the United Copper Company.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
When it became apparent
that the attempt would fail,

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.340 align:middle line:84%
banks that had lent
money to the scheme

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.650 align:middle line:84%
suffered a loss of
public confidence, which

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:90%
led to large cash withdrawals.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
The bank runs quickly spread
to affiliated banks and trusts,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
which within a week
led to the downfall

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.570 align:middle line:84%
of the massive
Knickerbocker Trust Company.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:10%
That was New York City's
third largest trust.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
The collapse of
the Knickerbocker

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:84%
was a major financial event
and spread even more fear

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
throughout the nation
as regional banks

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.640 align:middle line:84%
withdrew reserves from
the New York City banks.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
The panic extended nationwide
as people withdrew deposits

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:90%
from their regional banks.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Many bankruptcies followed.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Historians add that it was
only the direct intervention

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
of financier J.P. Morgan
that saved the day.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:10%
Morgan injected liquidity,
that is money, into the system.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, because there was
no official central bank

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
of the United States,
Morgan essentially

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.060 align:middle line:90%
fulfilled that role.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
This gave strong impetus
to an unpopular idea,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
but something that powerful
bankers had wanted for years--

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:90%
a strong central bank.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And this led directly to the
creation of the Federal Reserve

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Bank in 1913.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the official
interpretation of events.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But there are arguments
that this interpretation is

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.230 align:middle line:84%
very misleading and
that the Panic of 1907

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
might be one of the earliest
important false flags

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:90%
of the modern era.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
The basic claim is that
the panic was engineered

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.930 align:middle line:90%
to create a central US bank.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.900 align:middle line:84%
The claim is that New
York bankers artificially

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
inflated the stock
market with easy loans.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
When lending was then
tightened, the bubble

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
burst with stocks
crashing nearly 50%

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and all the various
runs on the banks.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.790 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream press
used the financial panic

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to make a case for establishing
a European-style central bank.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Within a few years, the
Federal Reserve Bank

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:84%
was created, fulfilling
exactly that role.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:84%
The question we
must ask is, what

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:90%
is the truth in this claim?

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's no problem
finding motive, that's for sure.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Immediately following
the great panic,

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
J.P. Morgan, John
D. Rockefeller,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and other giants of the
world financial scene,

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
including Jacob Schiff, Paul
Warburg, and Nathan Mayer

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Rothschild, all declared
that the lesson of the panic

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.820 align:middle line:84%
was that the US
needs a central bank.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
How convenient.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Only the most powerful
financial players in the world

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.480 align:middle line:90%
all happening to agree.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Actually, less than a
year before the panic,

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Jacob Schiff said
in a speech that

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:84%
without a powerful central bank,
the US would experience, quote,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
"the most severe and
far-reaching money panic

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.510 align:middle line:90%
in its history," end quote.

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, it soon did--

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:90%
at least, up to that point.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:84%
After the panic, President
Theodore Roosevelt

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:84%
appointed a National
Monetary Commission

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.410 align:middle line:84%
to study the causes of the
panic and to make suggestions.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
The chairman of the Commission
was Senator Nelson Aldrich,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.710 align:middle line:84%
father-in-law of
John D. Rockefeller,

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Jr. It was Aldrich who set
up a secret meeting just

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:90%
a few years later, in 1913.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
He brought the world's most
powerful bankers together.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
They arrived in secret at a
train station in New Jersey,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
only using first
names supposedly

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:90%
for a duck hunting trip.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:84%
With Aldrich were
the true masters

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:90%
of the universe of their day--

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
financier Paul
Warburg, as well as

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:84%
representatives of J.P. Morgan,
the Rothschilds in Europe,

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Rockefellers, and so on.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
They then took a private
rail car to a private club

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.170 align:middle line:84%
in a place called
Jekyll Island, Georgia.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:90%
There, they devised their plan.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Knowing that Americans
hated the idea

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.490 align:middle line:84%
of a powerful central
bank, something

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that would have too much control
over the nation's economy,

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
they came up with the
nifty idea of creating

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
many smaller central banks
scattered across the country.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, this idea,
the Federal Reserve Act,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:10%
was passed in Congress when many
Members were home on vacation

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:10%
and signed into law by
President Woodrow Wilson.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.660 align:middle line:84%
At the time of
the Fed's creation

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and during the early
years of its existence,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
there were a number
of individuals

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.290 align:middle line:84%
who stated that
the Panic of 1907

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:84%
was specifically engineered to
create a pretext for the Fed.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:84%
One was Senator Robert Latham
Owen, and one of the first two

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
senators from the
State of Oklahoma,

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
who called the Panic
of 1907 a deliberate

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.630 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy for the enrichment
of those who engineered it.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
This dovetailed
with the attitude

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
of Minnesota Congressman
Charles Lindbergh, Sr.--

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
yes, the father of
the famous aviator.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
When debating the Federal
Reserve Act in Congress,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Lindbergh warned that it would
establish, quote, "the most

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:90%
gigantic trust on Earth.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:84%
The worst legislative
crime of the ages

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
is perpetrated by
this bill," end quote.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:84%
He pointed out that the Fed
isn't public, but privately

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:84%
owned; conducted, he said, for
the sole purpose of obtaining

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
the greatest possible profits
from the use of other people's

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:90%
money--

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:90%
which actually is true.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.190 align:middle line:84%
To this day, it's
very hard to get data

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:84%
on specific
shareholders of the Fed.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:84%
But one oil industry insider
with connections to the House

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
of Saud, J.W. McAllister,
stated that 80% of the ownership

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.850 align:middle line:84%
of the New York
Federal Reserve Bank--

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:84%
that's easily the
most powerful branch--

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:84%
is owned by just eight
families, four of which

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:90%
live in the US, four in Europe.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.380 align:middle line:84%
We're talking Goldman
Sachs, Rockefellers,

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Lehmans and Kuhn Loebs in the
US and the European contingent

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:84%
being the Rothschilds,
the Warburgs,

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:84%
and two other names maybe less
well-known but very powerful--

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:84%
the Lazards in Paris and the
Israel Moses Sieffs in Rome.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, other
serious researchers

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:90%
corroborate these claims.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
When you see a financial
panic being instantly

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
used to create the most
powerful private banking power

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
elite the world has ever
seen, you have to ask,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.900 align:middle line:84%
did this all just
happen by chance?

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.002 align:middle line:84%
I think the smart
money is on no.

00:16:33.002 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Personalities
of the day John D.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.707 align:middle line:84%
Rockefeller enjoying his 93rd
year with three holes of golf

00:16:37.707 --> 00:16:38.507 align:middle line:90%
per outing.

00:16:38.507 --> 00:16:40.750 align:middle line:84%
He left business and
his multi-million dollar

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.926 align:middle line:90%
philanthropies to younger hands.

00:16:44.926 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Senate investigations
were making headlines.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It was J.P. Morgan on the
grill, telling the senators

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.640 align:middle line:84%
yes, his banking had a
quarter of a billion dollars

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.220 align:middle line:84%
in the till and no, he
had not an paid income

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:90%
tax in the last two years.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Now let's talk about
the Lusitania in 1915.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.270 align:middle line:84%
In August 1914, war
broke out in Europe.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:84%
It soon became known as
the Great War, later to us

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.579 align:middle line:84%
World War I. This was the most
awful, horrible, bloody war

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:84%
the world had ever seen up until
then, causing so much death

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and destruction that the phrase
lost generation was coined

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.240 align:middle line:90%
accurately to describe it.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It pitted the United
Kingdom, France, and Russia--

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:90%
known as the Allied powers--

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:84%
against what were
called Central Powers--

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that meant Germany and the
Austrian-Hungarian Empire,

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:90%
basically central Europe--

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.680 align:middle line:84%
against the
peripheries of Europe.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Across the Atlantic Ocean,
the great United States

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
just gazed at the carnage
without overtly taking sides.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The United States
must be neutral in fact,

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:90%
as well as name.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.936 align:middle line:84%
Most Americans agree,
this is Europe's war.

00:17:53.936 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And from the time of
George Washington,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
we have been warned to stay
out of Europe's conflicts.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> America had people from all
the combatant nations living

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:04.490 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Why get involved
in a terrible war

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of a huge
ocean when you didn't need to?

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:84%
Nearly a year into that
war, a German submarine

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
sunk a British passenger
ship, the RMS Lusitania,

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
off the coast of
southern Ireland.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:84%
1,195 people died,
including 128 Americans.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Children and babies died.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
The shock was terrible
and greatly enraged

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.900 align:middle line:90%
the American public opinion.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Americans nearly entered
the war then and there,

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:84%
but President Wilson
held off the pressure

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.430 align:middle line:84%
until two years later,
when America finally

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle line:90%
did enter the war.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>> For three years, Woodrow
Wilson had compromised with

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Germany and each new compromise
had brought new indignity.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Now his people wanted war.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Even then, the Lusitania
was one of the major reasons.

00:18:57.995 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:84%
But what was the truth behind
the sinking of the Lusitania?

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.230 align:middle line:10%
At the time, the
American public saw this

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:10%
as pure, unmitigated
German treachery.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.450 align:middle line:10%
Killing innocent
civilians, including

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of women and
children, didn't go over well

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:10%
with the public, especially when
they were whipped into a frenzy

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:10%
by the newspapers of the day.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.450 align:middle line:84%
But as is always
the case, reality

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:90%
is a little more complex.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:84%
By May of 1915, the war
had become a nightmare

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:30.690 align:middle line:84%
for all nations involved,
and not just in the trenches

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
where most of the
soldiers fought.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Also on the high seas.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Germany had declared the seas
around all of Great Britain

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:90%
to be a war zone.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:84%
German submarines,
known as u-boats,

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:84%
were taking out huge
amounts of British shipping.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Striking without warning,
German submarines begin to sink

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Allied ships.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Every single week, 300,000
tons of British shipping were

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.740 align:middle line:90%
being sunk by German u-boats.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.740 align:middle line:84%
One out of every four
steamers leaving Great Britain

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.180 align:middle line:90%
never came back.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:90%
This was a major crisis.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:90%
So back to the Lusitania.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:84%
In the first place, it wasn't
just a huge passenger ship.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:84%
The Lusitania was doing
a bit more than just

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:90%
carrying passengers.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what it was doing
was violating the rules

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.520 align:middle line:84%
of warfare at the
time by transporting

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:84%
war material for
the Allied armies,

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:84%
including large
amounts of explosives.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.630 align:middle line:84%
The Germans were
well aware of this,

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and indeed, the
Lusitania was registered

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:84%
with the British fleet as an
auxiliary military vessel.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.780 align:middle line:84%
This status meant, in
fact, that it could

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:90%
be fired on without warning.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans were mired
down on the Western Front

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
with the British
and French troops,

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and here was the Lusitania
delivering ammunition

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:90%
to the enemy.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:10%
The Germans also knew that
not just British subjects,

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.589 align:middle line:10%
but Americans, also
regularly sailed on the ship.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't want to
stir any needless trouble

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:90%
with the Americans.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So the German
Embassy in Washington

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
actually placed an advertisement
in 50 US newspapers

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
warning civilians not to
sail on the Lusitania.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:10%
Incredibly, the US
State Department

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:10%
made sure that most of the
notices were not published.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.980 align:middle line:10%
At least one slipped
through, however,

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:10%
in the Des Moines
Register, which

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:10%
carried the German
ad warning Americans

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:10%
not to get on the ship.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> May 1st, 1915.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
The luxurious British liner
Lusitania sails from New York.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Aboard are hundreds
of Americans.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:84%
They ignore a notice published
next to the announcement

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
of the ship's sailing,
a warning inserted

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:90%
by the German government.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Travelers sailing in the war
zone do so at their own risk.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:55.889 align:middle line:90%
>> It was very up front.

00:21:55.889 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a state of war
existing between Britain

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:84%
and Germany, the ad said,
and that zone of war

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:84%
included the waters next
to the British Isles.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:10%
Any vessels flying the flag
of Great Britain or her allies

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:10%
were quote, "liable to
destruction in those waters

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.650 align:middle line:10%
and that travelers
sailing in the war zone

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:10%
on the ships of Great
Britain or her allies

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:10%
do so at their own
risk," end quote.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
So the Germans gave fair
warning, but where's

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.446 align:middle line:90%
the false flag in all of this?

00:22:24.446 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing we
can do-- as always--

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
is ask the question,
who benefits?

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were two
main beneficiaries.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.810 align:middle line:84%
One was the British government
itself and more generally,

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.190 align:middle line:90%
the Allied powers.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.410 align:middle line:84%
After all, Britain
was on the ropes

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and really needed America to
enter the war on its side.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:84%
But another beneficiary
with just as much motivation

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:84%
were the major bankers,
specifically J.P. Morgan.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It is not outrageous
to think that they

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
could have acted in concert,
or at least with some sort

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:90%
of loose understanding.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.350 align:middle line:84%
First, let's look
at the bankers.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:22:59.940 align:middle line:84%
During the war,
England and France

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.475 align:middle line:84%
didn't just throw millions
of men into the fight.

00:23:02.475 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
They had to pay for all of this,
which was incredibly expensive.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:84%
To do so, they borrowed heavily
from American investors.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:84%
That is Americans would purchase
British and French government

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
bonds to finance
their war effort

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and those bonds would be
paid back with some interest.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
To sell their bonds, the
British and French governments

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
had a go-to guy to
sell them, J.P. Morgan,

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.090 align:middle line:84%
one of the most powerful
bankers in the world

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and incidentally a key partner
of the Rothschild banking

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.470 align:middle line:90%
dynasty.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but Morgan also
acted as a purchasing agent

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
for those governments in
buying weapons and munitions

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:90%
from the US.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Very nice for J.P. Morgan,
to be sure, which by the way

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
he was also doing not simply
for Britain and France,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
but with business in
Russia, Italy, and Canada.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:90%
But it gets better.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.540 align:middle line:84%
J.P. Morgan controlled
countless holding companies,

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and through these owned
many of the manufacturing

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.940 align:middle line:84%
firms that had contracts
for military production.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.550 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know the
origin of the modern military

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.520 align:middle line:84%
industrial complex,
look no further.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Morgan and his companies
were making a fortune

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
literally every
single day off the war

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and were doing it in
every possible way--

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.015 align:middle line:84%
purchasing, selling,
and producing.

00:24:16.015 --> 00:24:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> But is America truly neutral?

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Germany sees that
the vast resources

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.890 align:middle line:84%
of the American
industry machine--

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.115 align:middle line:84%
the food, the
munitions, the loans--

00:24:28.115 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
are keeping Germany's enemies
fighting in the field.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>> But by early 1915, things
were looking bleak for Britain.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.090 align:middle line:84%
The constant loss of
its shipping fleet

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
from German u-boats
was a major crisis.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
What would happen to
the British government?

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:84%
There was a real concern that
the Brits would lose the war.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
By spring of 1915, Morgan
wasn't able to find new buyers

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
for the Allied war bonds
because if Britain lost the war,

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.740 align:middle line:84%
the Allies would
default on their bonds

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and all that big money
Morgan was making would end.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but his
investors would suffer losses

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.180 align:middle line:84%
estimated as high
as $1.5 billion,

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
which in 1915 was an
unbelievable amount of money.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all of Morgan's
war production companies

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:84%
would stop making weapons
and maybe go out of business.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:84%
So this was an
urgent situation--

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:84%
bizarre, twisted, but from
Morgan's point of view urgent.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So on May 1st,
1915, the Lusitania

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:84%
left New York City for a
week-long voyage to Britain.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Some serious
researchers now believe

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that Morgan realized something
important, if the Germans were

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to sink the ship the Americans
would be furious, perhaps

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:84%
so furious that they
would enter the war

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the Allies.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:10%
And if that were to happen,
not only would Allied bonds

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:10%
be in great demand again, but
Morgan's war companies would

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:10%
be busier than ever
because now they

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.230 align:middle line:10%
would have millions
of American soldiers

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:10%
to prepare for the Great War.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Problem solved.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Six days later, on
May 7th, the Lusitania

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:84%
approached within 12 miles
of the southern Irish coast.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:10%
The Lord of the
British Admiralty

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.400 align:middle line:10%
was 41-year-old
Winston Churchill.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Churchill knew all about
what the German u-boats were

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.450 align:middle line:90%
doing, obviously.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he knew in
the past two days

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.030 align:middle line:84%
that three ships had
just been sunk right

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.600 align:middle line:90%
where the Lusitania now was.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Did Churchill make sure
that the Lusitania had

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.010 align:middle line:84%
the protection of her
escort, or perhaps knowing

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
there were hundreds of
civilians on the ship

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that the
Lusitania was illegally

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.340 align:middle line:84%
carrying both civilians and
weapons at the same time

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
that he would at least do his
best to protect the ship as it

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
approached the UK, especially
since the Germans had already

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.560 align:middle line:90%
issued their warning?

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.800 align:middle line:90%
You'd think so.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, Churchill
did the opposite.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
He actually ordered the assigned
escort to the Lusitania,

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.330 align:middle line:84%
a destroyer named Juno,
to return to harbor.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.090 align:middle line:84%
The Lusitania was even
ordered to shut down

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:84%
one of its four boilers,
supposedly to save coal.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But of course, this reduced
her speed considerably.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:84%
She was just sitting out
there totally exposed,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.567 align:middle line:90%
and Churchill knew it.

00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:17.012 align:middle line:90%
May 7th, 1915.

00:27:17.012 --> 00:27:19.376 align:middle line:90%
The Lusitania is sunk.

00:27:19.376 --> 00:27:22.790 align:middle line:90%
128 Americans are lost.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Now there is a sense of
crisis in Washington.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> With all of these early
potential false flag cases,

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.350 align:middle line:84%
we have to recognize that
evidence comes to us in little

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:90%
pieces here and there.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's always worth
asking, who benefits?

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, without
a doubt, the bankers

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.290 align:middle line:90%
and the British government.

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, the actions of the
Royal Navy under Churchill

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.730 align:middle line:84%
are highly suspicious and
not easily explainable.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:84%
They're exactly the
kind of anomalies

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:90%
we look for in false flags.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's true that the United
States did not immediately

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:84%
enter the war after the
sinking of the Lusitania,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:84%
but not everything
goes according to plan.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Within two years, however, the
nonstop anti-German propaganda

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
barrage had seriously altered
public opinion and the House

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
of Morgan, the
House of Rothschild,

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and all the other
major banking houses

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
could then be delighted by
America's entry into the war.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:25.520 align:middle line:84%
The slaughter and misery
meant huge profits and power

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Huge wars send American
factories working overtime.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.340 align:middle line:84%
More and more
workers are needed.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Higher wages
result. Europe's war

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.590 align:middle line:90%
is making America prosperous.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at these
events of a century ago,

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:84%
several of them
genuine false flags,

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:53.730 align:middle line:84%
we find that the world back then
operated very much as the world

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:90%
operates today.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
What appears on the surface
is very, very different

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.080 align:middle line:90%
from what goes on beneath.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.510 align:middle line:84%
We're all wiser
when we realize this

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.090 align:middle line:84%
because such patterns
never change.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Join me next time
on False Flags, when

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:84%
we look at how with total
control of the media,

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.130 align:middle line:84%
skilled covert operatives,
and no scruples

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:84%
the Nazis helped to pioneer
the modern false flag.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Some people might think
that all this talk

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.260 align:middle line:84%
about false flags and
nasty government activities

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:90%
is upsetting.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:84%
What I would say
is this, the art

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.480 align:middle line:84%
of personal development
for each one of us

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.900 align:middle line:84%
requires us to shed the many
illusions that have surrounded

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.910 align:middle line:90%
us all our lives.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Illusions are painful to
shed, but once they're

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
gone we enter a
truly higher reality.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.680 align:middle line:84%
So don't fear the red
pill because if you

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.020 align:middle line:84%
seek transformation,
you need truth

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:90%
as your constant companion.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm Richard Dolan
until next time.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:90%
