>>If you are someone who
cares about the world

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:10%
you live in and are interested
in that elusive thing called

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.670 align:middle line:10%
"the truth," if you're
interested in true personal

through the truth,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:10%
then maybe this is
the show for you.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Our world is filled
with violence,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:84%
bombings, acts of
terror, trauma.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 align:middle line:84%
In watching or reading
the news, we almost

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
start to think this is
the normal way things

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.524 align:middle line:90%
are supposed to be.

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:84%
What I think happens is
that people watch the news--

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:90%
say CNN, Fox, or NBC--

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and they get to a point where
they can't take it anymore.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:90%
And then they just tune out.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It's too confusing, too
violent, too negative.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
You start to wonder, why
put that into my life?

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Tuning out from the
political is part

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
of a larger symptom, the spread
of a sense of hopelessness.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Many people can feel this,
even if they can't always

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.000 align:middle line:90%
see it or put it into words.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a loss of control, a sense
that the vehicle you thought

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.080 align:middle line:84%
you were driving is actually
being driven by someone else.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:84%
It comes with this
sense of confusion

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:84%
about the world in which
the politics around us

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to make
any sense, and there

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:90%
doesn't seem to be any way out.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But what I am suggesting to
you is that this is by design.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
The confusion,
the hopelessness--

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:90%
it's not an accident.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Maybe once long
ago, we might have

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.770 align:middle line:84%
believed that the
political establishment was

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:90%
working for the people--

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:84%
corrupt, sure, but
more or less, something

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that worked on
behalf of the public.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
It's what our society
still tells us every day--

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:84%
that ever so
slowly, we're moving

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
toward greater inclusion,
greater democracy, right?

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe not.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:84%
The confusion and
hopelessness are no accident,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:90%
and there is a reason for this.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So this is a series on false
flags and covert operations.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Two questions
probably come to mind.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.110 align:middle line:90%
First, what's a "false flag?"

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, how do
false flags and covert ops

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
relate to what I've
just been talking about?

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about false
flags and what they are.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:10%
Most basically, a
false flag is an action

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:10%
done by a person or
usually a group--

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.360 align:middle line:10%
say a government or an
intelligence agency--

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:10%
that's then blamed on someone
else like, oh, terrorists,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.340 align:middle line:10%
which is then used to justify
things that could not otherwise

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:10%
be justified like passing
authoritarian laws

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:10%
or justifying military invasions
and financial takeovers

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:10%
of nations, oh, like
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.034 align:middle line:10%
Ukraine, or Syria.

00:02:46.034 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
It can even be used for
something as straightforward

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
as diplomatic pressure
and propaganda victories.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we now know that
America's CIA has the ability

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
to conduct cyber
attacks and leave

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:84%
phony cyber fingerprints that
would implicate another nation.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Pretty slick.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Undoubtedly, there
are other nations

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:90%
with similar capabilities.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
False flags are a
genuine phenomenon.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:90%
They are real.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people
will try to tell you

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
that false flags are
tin foil hat territory,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
but in fact, as you
will see in this series,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.590 align:middle line:84%
there have been many
verified false flags.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Now we turn to the pirates.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
It's from these
fellows of history

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that we actually get the
phrase, "false flag."

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:84%
The term itself goes back
to early maritime history,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
particularly when
pirates would use

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:84%
the flags of other countries
to lure commercial vessels.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Then when the prey
got close enough,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
the Pirates would hoist their
black flag, board the ship,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:90%
and steal its valuables.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Professional historians
tell us false flags were not

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
uncommon during the
golden age of piracy,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.770 align:middle line:90%
the 17th and 18th centuries.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
You would think
that from a group

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
of people whose activities
are the cause of the phrase,

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
"false flag," that we
would have many false flag

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:90%
stories from them.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we have
only a small handful

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.386 align:middle line:84%
of specific examples
of pirate false flags.

00:04:06.386 --> 00:04:10.274 align:middle line:90%

00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
the pirates in those days

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
had more honor than the agencies
of today that do false flags.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.970 align:middle line:84%
At least when the pirates
stole your treasure,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.540 align:middle line:90%
you knew it was them.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Today's perpetrators
of false flags

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
certainly don't make it
so easy to pinpoint them.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
This program will be discussing
the history of false flags,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:84%
looking at the phenomenon
in its early history,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
then really spending time on
the 20th and 21st centuries.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:10%
We'll be examining
how false flags went

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:10%
from almost laughably simplistic
in their earliest incarnation

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:10%
to the development and impact
of the false flags that

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:10%
led to the Second World War
like the German Reichstag fire

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:10%
and invasion of Poland and
the Japanese false flags

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:10%
against China in the 1930s
and several interesting Soviet

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:10%
false flags.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:10%
We'll also take a special look
at the attack on Pearl Harbor

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:10%
and seek to understand
to what extent

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:10%
that attack was
desired and enabled

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:10%
by certain elites within
the United States.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Then we move into the Cold War
and, finally, the 21st century.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:84%
We'll see how and why the United
States became and still is

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:84%
the world's leader in false
flags, how false flags have

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
become increasingly directed
against domestic populations,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:84%
whether through the FBI's
COINTELPRO of the 1950s

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
and '60s, the infamous Operation
Gladio, the infamous Chinese

democratic governments,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.090 align:middle line:10%
and even enable military
invasions from the operations

in the Middle East and
Central America in the 1950s

and '60s to the wars and new
cold wars of the 21st century.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a real
art in eliminating

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.060 align:middle line:84%
undesirable governments based
on fake evidence and smear

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:90%
campaigns.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:10%
Of course, we will be looking at
9/11, still the most important

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.260 align:middle line:10%
false flag of our lifetime.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:10%
>>On September the
11th, enemies of freedom

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:10%
Our war on terror
begins with al-Qaeda,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:10%
but it does not end there.

>>The justification for
the US war on terror

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:10%

not merely in the United States,
but mimicked in other nations

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:10%
around the world.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:10%
9/11 transformed
the world, and it

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:10%
was without any shadow
of a doubt perpetrated

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.800 align:middle line:10%
upon us as a grand deception.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Now as we're headed toward two
decades of post-9/11 dystopia,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
it's more important than ever to
look at that event with a cold

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:90%
eye toward the truth.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And I can assure you we
will be doing just that.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, false flags
did not stop with 9/11.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, we are now living
in an era of them--

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
the bombings, the shootings, the
setup jobs on innocent people,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and even the never-ending
health scares,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:84%
each designed in its
own way to induce fear

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and to expand control
over citizens, something

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.610 align:middle line:84%
that we will try to
alleviate in this series

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%

of how false flags are carried

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.340 align:middle line:90%

that he has existing and active
military plans for the use

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:10%
of chemical or
biological weapons,

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:10%
which could be activated
within 45 minutes,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:10%
including against his
own Shia population,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:10%
and that he's actively trying
to acquire nuclear weapons

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:10%
capability.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:10%
>>We all believed that weapons
of mass destruction were there,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:04.835 align:middle line:10%
but they weren't.

00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>That's a quick
overview of what

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
we'll be examining
in this series,

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
but I'd like to explore a
few interesting things first.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
False flags is a
form of propaganda

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and is a form of psychological
operation, or psyop.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd also like to explain
the preconditions

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
necessary for false
flags, and as a bonus,

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
offer a quick little lesson
in these steps of false flags.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
First, it's important to
understand that false flags are

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.990 align:middle line:90%
a form of propaganda.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:84%
After all, propaganda
is nothing more

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
than a language of
deception and manipulation

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:39.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to persuade people to
support a particular position.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
There are many levels of
propaganda in our world.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.890 align:middle line:84%
From the basic forms of
cultural conditioning

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:84%
you get in school to the
incessant cultural distractions

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:84%
that tell you to look over here
at the next shiny, new trinket

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
to the news media
that's owned by a very

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.020 align:middle line:84%
few massive corporations that
select and spin information

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
in extremely self-serving
ways by which

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:84%
they omit nearly all the
genuinely important news

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:90%
developments of our world.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.240 align:middle line:10%
>>Several people
have been killed.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.070 align:middle line:10%
>>The men murdered that soldier.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:10%
>>Trying to drive
a class warfare.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:10%
>>Bomb crews worked outside
looking for explosives.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>Indeed, those first few
levels of propaganda--

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
cultural conditioning,
cultural distractions,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:90%
and news media control--

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
easily account for
most of the mind

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
manipulation that
allows powerful elites

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:90%
to get their way.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:10%
The system works extremely
well, especially when

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:10%
most of the population is
overworked, overmedicated,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:10%
eating bad food, bombarding
people with sex scandals

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:10%
and sports, while tossing
in meaningless political

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:10%
platitudes usually works
really well at keeping people

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:10%
off their game.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Even so, every once
in a while, stronger

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
medicine is needed for
elites to get what they want.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.800 align:middle line:84%
That's when they might use
covert ops, regime change

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:90%
tactics, and yes, false flags.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about psyops.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.670 align:middle line:84%
You might be interested to
know that countries worldwide

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.480 align:middle line:84%
recognize false flags as part
of a new form of warfare,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
hybrid warfare, essentially,
full spectrum warfare.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Hybrid warfare uses the
conventional warfare tactics

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
of armies and navies
and air forces,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.720 align:middle line:84%
but it also adds
something more, what

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:90%
it calls irregular warfare.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And this can include almost
anything you can think of--

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:84%
cyber warfare, media
propaganda, terrorist actions,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of clandestine
secret activities

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.916 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't know exactly
who was behind an action.

00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
know who did it,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:90%
you can't really fight back.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.550 align:middle line:84%
We're really talking about a
revolution in how to wage war,

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's going on
right under our noses.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that when
a country or its military

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
talks about hybrid warfare, it's
always talking about something

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:90%
that the other guy does.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:10%
>>A computer virus
called Stuxnet

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:10%
was discovered
looking in the data

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:10%
banks of power plants, traffic
control systems, and factories

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.600 align:middle line:10%
around the world.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Buried deep in the Stuxnet
code was a specific target.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Without that target, the
virus remained dormant.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
What was it looking
to shut down?

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:10%
The centrifuges that
spin nuclear material

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:10%
at Iran's enrichment facilities.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Stuxnet was a weapon, the
first to be made entirely

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:90%
out of code.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>One key element
of hybrid warfare

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.710 align:middle line:84%
is psychological
operations or psyops.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.470 align:middle line:10%
Nowadays, the military calls
it by a different name--

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.430 align:middle line:10%
Military Information
Support Operations, or MISO.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:10%
But the mission is
still the same--

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.430 align:middle line:10%
in their words, to
selectively convey information

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:10%
to influence minds,
emotions, and what they

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:10%
call the objective
reasoning of targets.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
In other words, influencing
populations through propaganda,

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:90%
spin, and deception.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:10%
The military and intelligence
community practice three kinds

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:10%
of psyops--

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:10%
white, gray, and black.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
White psyops are
straightforward.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.100 align:middle line:84%
These are openly acknowledged
statements or actions

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
of the government,
or at least are

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:84%
attributed to a source
associated closely

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.796 align:middle line:90%
with that government.

00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:10%
They would reflect an official
viewpoint like a statement

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.594 align:middle line:10%
by the president or a
government official.

00:12:10.594 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
they're truthful, by the way.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
After all, presidents can
be pretty good at lying.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Gray psyops are a
bit more interesting.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:84%
These are statements or actions
in which the source is, quote,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.830 align:middle line:90%
"deliberately ambiguous."

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:10%
In other words, even
though the true source

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.570 align:middle line:10%
would be the government,
you wouldn't know that.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.660 align:middle line:10%
A classic example of this
is government collusion

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:10%
with mainstream media in which
the media spins and misleads,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:10%
posing as objective journalism,
when, in fact, they're working

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:10%
directly for the government.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.610 align:middle line:10%
The best known historical
example of gray psyops

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:10%
was Operation Mockingbird.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Do you have any
people being paid

00:12:51.010 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:84%
by the CIA, who are contributing
to the national news

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.362 align:middle line:90%
services, AP and UPI?

00:13:05.362 --> 00:13:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Well again, I
think we're getting

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.710 align:middle line:84%
into the kind of
detail, Mr. Chairman,

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
that I'd prefer to handle
in executive session.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>This ran from the
1940s through the 1970s

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and involved the
secret collaboration

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.674 align:middle line:84%
of hundreds of American
journalists with the CIA.

00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:22.090 align:middle line:84%
This might've
involved journalists

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:25.330 align:middle line:84%
conducting espionage for the
CIA while in a foreign country.

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
It might've involved
planting false stories.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
It might've involved
controlling editorial policy.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself what you
could do with hundreds

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
of mainstream journalists
secretly on your payroll.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Mockingbird was
manipulative enough.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Today, things are far
more sophisticated.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.570 align:middle line:84%
There are countless
whistleblowers, leaks,

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and investigations
that make it clear.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.150 align:middle line:84%
What passes for mainstream
journalism today

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
is little more
than the propaganda

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:84%
machine for the
national security state.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.820 align:middle line:84%
We'll be coming back to that sad
reality later in the program.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And then there are black psyops.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Now things get
really interesting.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1954, the CIA
defined black psyops

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
as something perpetrated
that appeared

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to emanate from a source
hostile in nature.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.160 align:middle line:84%
The US government would
deny any connection.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
The policy statement went
on to say that, quote,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.060 align:middle line:84%
"The content may be partially
or completely fabricated,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:84%
but that which is fabricated
is made to appear credible."

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
That, my friends,
is a false flag--

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
perpetrating something that
you blame on your enemy.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.420 align:middle line:10%
Now that statement
might be from 1954,

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:10%
but today in the 21st century,
the US Army Psychological

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.760 align:middle line:10%
Operations Manual uses
the exact same definitions

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:10%
of white, gray, and
black psyops that the CIA

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.230 align:middle line:10%
was using in the 1950s
and the very same words.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
In other words, false flags
are in the official playbook

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:84%
of the US military and
intelligence community.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:10%
>>Persuade, change, influence.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.650 align:middle line:10%
That is the motto of the US
Army's psychological operations

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:10%
regimen.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.550 align:middle line:84%
They employ specific
communication methods

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.040 align:middle line:84%
using a variety of
techniques, technology,

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and mediums to
develop and deliver

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
messages, which will have the
greatest impact and influence.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.272 align:middle line:84%
These methods often
incorporate the use

00:15:26.272 --> 00:15:28.930 align:middle line:84%
of state of the art
multimedia products

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:84%

door into the FBI office

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and stole all the files,
documents, and correspondence

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Recent events have
given more indication

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
of the extent of government
snooping on civilians.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:10%
>>There's always one
other fundamental question

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:10%
we need to be asking
about dramatic events that

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:10%
make the headlines, and
that is item number seven,

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:10%
who benefits?

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.170 align:middle line:10%
>>Dick Cheney said it
would be a bad idea,

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:10%
and that's why the first
Bush didn't go into Baghdad.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:10%
Dick Cheney then goes
to work for Halliburton,

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.001 align:middle line:10%
making hundreds of millions
of dollars as their CEO.

00:23:44.001 --> 00:23:45.834 align:middle line:10%
Next thing you know
he's back in government.

00:23:45.834 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:10%
It's a good idea
to go into Iraq.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.660 align:middle line:10%
>>He goes on to point
out that 9/11 offered

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.060 align:middle line:10%
an easily exploited
opportunity for Cheney

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:10%
to help mastermind
an Iraq invasion

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:10%
and make a pile of cash.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>Basic questions we must
always be asking ourselves--

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:84%
does this alleged terrorist
action or whatever it is

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:84%
give a clear benefit to any
government, any corporation,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:90%
or financial institution?

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
We need to look
behind the headlines

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and what we are clearly
being pressured to think.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.482 align:middle line:84%
If there is a major beneficiary,
we need to be aware of it.

00:24:17.482 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Throughout our history,
there have always

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:84%
been a privileged few,
but not like today.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Today, a very tiny group of
people and their corporations

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:84%
are looking to own all the
water, all the minerals, all

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.090 align:middle line:84%
the natural resources, all the
genetically modified foods, all

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
the public services
that were formerly

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:90%
administered by governments.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
They are moving
to take all of it

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and manage these
for their profit.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Today, the eight wealthiest
people in the world

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.860 align:middle line:84%
have as much money
as the poorest half

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.000 align:middle line:90%
of the entire human race.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Eight people owning
as much wealth

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.020 align:middle line:90%
as nearly four billion people--

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
it's really not
that complicated,

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.280 align:middle line:84%
when so few people
and their corporations

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.520 align:middle line:84%
are moving so far ahead
of the rest of us.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.430 align:middle line:84%
In terms of ownership of
everything worth owning,

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.430 align:middle line:84%
they will do everything possible
to keep us out of the way

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:90%
while they do it.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
They will influence governments
around the world, especially

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:90%
the most powerful.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:84%
They will ensure the passage
of corporate-friendly laws

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
that will cement their
position forever.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And they will definitely
control the television news

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.851 align:middle line:84%
and entertainment
system, making sure

00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that whatever messages
come through the channels

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:84%
of your TV or your
local newspaper

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:90%
are friendly to their interests.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:84%
But if these people are
going to take everything

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
worth taking in this
world, they can't simply

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:90%
tell you what they're up to.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
After all, you and I might have
something to say about that.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So they must rule by
deception, by confusion,

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.220 align:middle line:90%
by spin and propaganda.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.730 align:middle line:84%
The truth is there usually is
a benefit to certain interests

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
when these things
occur, and it's not

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.490 align:middle line:84%
anti-government to ask
questions about it.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, it's the mark of someone
who still has the ability

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to think independently,
perhaps the most important,

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and during certain periods in
history, the most dangerous

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:90%
quality we might have.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Those are the big seven
items of a false flag,

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and as we move
through this series,

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.314 align:middle line:84%
we'll be looking at the events
under review through this lens.

00:26:13.314 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But I want to point
out that this is not

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.260 align:middle line:90%
quite the same as a formula.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:84%
There are patterns
to look for, but we

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:84%
need to remind ourselves
that this phenomenon is

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:90%
ever-changing.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.610 align:middle line:10%
In the modern era
of false flags,

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:10%
for instance, there are other
developments to look for--

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:10%
the existence of
multiple drills going on

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:10%
during the day of
the false flag,

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:10%
drills that actually mimic
the event that occurs.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:84%
There is also a not
uncommon connection

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
of suspects to intelligence
organizations like the CIA

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.880 align:middle line:84%
or FBI in America
and their equivalent

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
agencies in other
countries, for instance.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Then there is the
proliferation of slogans,

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.750 align:middle line:84%
often immediately appearing
as if they were cooked up

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:90%
in a Madison Avenue boardroom.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Overall, we see increasing
levels of sophistication

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
in 21st century false
flags, including

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.050 align:middle line:84%
a seamless integration with
mainstream websites, search

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:84%
engines, and even cooperation
with so-called alternative

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:09.520 align:middle line:84%
websites that maybe aren't
so alternative after all.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
This series will
examine many proven

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and provable false flags
that have shaped our world

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.570 align:middle line:90%
over the past century.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Together, we're going to
walk through that history,

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and in so doing, gain a
perspective that will enable us

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to understand why we have
false flags and, perhaps,

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:30.040 align:middle line:84%
most important of all, how to
identify them as they happen,

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.740 align:middle line:84%
because if you can be sure
of anything in this world,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:84%
it's that there will be
more false flags to come.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Our job as citizens
of the world is not

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
to allow governments to
have us live in fear.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to see the world
clearly without illusion

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.530 align:middle line:84%
beyond the propaganda
and beyond the trauma.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Through awareness,
we are empowered.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Through honest
exploration, we can

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:84%
see through the
fear-mongering narrative

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.920 align:middle line:90%
we're exposed to daily.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.720 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard many times that
the truth shall set us free.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.630 align:middle line:84%
After all, how can
we be free, if we are

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.240 align:middle line:90%
shackled to lies and deception?

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So my friends, remember,
reaching the truth

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.250 align:middle line:84%
means stripping away
the illusions around us.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Don't buy into the fear.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.370 align:middle line:90%
It's about waking up.

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Join me next time
on False Flags when

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:90%
we look at early false flags.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.890 align:middle line:90%
How far back do they go?

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm Richard Dolan.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:29.611 align:middle line:90%
