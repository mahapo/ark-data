00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.766 align:middle line:84%
I'm Richard Dolan, and
this is False Flags.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:20.510 align:middle line:10%
The Second World
War ended in 1945.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.770 align:middle line:10%
It resulted in a world dominated
by two major military powers--

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:10%
the United States
and the Soviet Union.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:84%
The US for its part had
an unprecedented advantage

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:84%
in wealth, power, and influence
over the rest of the world.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of the
fence was the Soviet Union,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
a nation under the
rule of dictator Joseph

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Stalin, a society of
incredible repression,

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:84%
but which had a powerful
military and its own client

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:90%
states, just like the US.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
This was the era
of the Cold War.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a war all right, even if
it wasn't an open shooting war.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:90%
It was a war for global control.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.135 align:middle line:84%
>> The opposing point of
view in this conflict rests

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:84%
on a fundamentally
different vision of man,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:84%
as a creature not of
God, but of the state.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.380 align:middle line:84%
In this system, the
value of individual man

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
diminishes sharply, and
the state is all important.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
The state will run his life
for him, his political life,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:84%
his business life,
his social life.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
What we oppose fundamentally
is the aggressive nature

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:84%
of the communist state,
its unceasing effort

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
to expand wherever it
can, to grow bigger,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.151 align:middle line:90%
to take over, to supplant.

00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
This deadly impulse
toward aggression

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.900 align:middle line:84%
we oppose as a continual
threat to peace.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.840 align:middle line:84%
These are the contrasting
points of view

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:84%
between the major antagonists
in the conflict, which

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
has become known over the
last decade as the Cold War.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> As such, both sides not only
played dirty pool in dominating

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
other nations, but they
engaged in various tactics

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate their
own population.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
In the case of
Stalin's Soviet Union,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about extremely
heavy-handed propaganda,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:84%
techniques and
tactics so obvious,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that they are painful
for intelligent people

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:90%
to look at these days.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you got
out of line in that society,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:84%
you were in danger of getting
a 3:00 AM knock on the door

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and disappearing for a
while, sometimes forever.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Through fear like that,
the control came easily.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:90%
The US side of it was trickier.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
America always had
a certain ideology,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:84%
one that emphasized the value of
freedom and individual rights.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Heavy-handed state
surveillance and intimidation

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.776 align:middle line:84%
was definitely not
the American way.

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
People had the right to
decide for themselves

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
what they believed and
who they voted for, right?

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, it makes
for a great story.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
The reality was that
there was an entire world

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
to be won, an
entire world to own.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:84%
This didn't mean that
America would simply

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
allow other nations to
decide their own fate

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and to allow its own people
to think for themselves.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.900 align:middle line:84%
America's elite simply had
to be really, really good

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:90%
at managing public opinion.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
This reality
constitutes the logic

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
behind American
actions in the 1950s

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.540 align:middle line:84%
and the massive public
manipulation that took place.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And it explains why Americans
became the world leader

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
in false flag operations
during this period.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Relating to the false
flag phenomenon itself,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:84%
we see an important
development taking place

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.310 align:middle line:90%
during the Cold War.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
They are being
used more and more

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.660 align:middle line:90%
against domestic populations.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:84%
Sure, there were some
important domestic false flags

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.940 align:middle line:90%
of the 1930s.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:84%
But not until the 1950s did
this feature become increasingly

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:90%
important--

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:90%
false flags against the people.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And not only the United
States and its allies,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
over in Communist
China during the 1960s,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
the Chairman Mao perpetrated
one of the greatest

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:84%
head fake, psych job false
flags of modern times

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:90%
against the Chinese people--

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:90%
the Cultural Revolution.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Because now, systems of
propaganda were in place.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And increasingly, we find
governments around the world

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
eager to use them.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what men can do
if you give them a chance.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Give them economic freedom.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
Economic freedom in
this country means

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that you and everybody else is
free to work, to make things,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:90%
to produce.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:90%
That's one part of it.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.585 align:middle line:84%
You're free to buy and sell,
to make a profit or a loss.

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:90%
That's the second part.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're free to
save and to invest

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.160 align:middle line:90%
in more and better tools.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the third part.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And it all adds up to the
great gift of economic freedom.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Keep it in mind as you watch
these men and their tools.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Our first stop
is Operation Gladio,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:84%
which ran from the end of the
Second World War until well

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.420 align:middle line:90%
into the 1980s.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Gladio was nothing other
than a covert campaign

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:90%
of provocateur terrorism.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds were killed, murdered
by NATO-backed operatives,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and blamed on communists.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:10%
Gladio was the code name
for a clandestine NATO

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:10%
stay-behind operation
throughout most of Europe

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:10%
during the Cold War.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:84%
The basic idea was to
prepare for and carry out

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
armed resistance in the
event of a Soviet invasion.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Although the Italian
operation is best known,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
especially after it
was discovered in 1990,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
indeed Gladio was the specific
name of the Italian operation,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
still Gladio is informally used
as the name for all of them.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
secret armies coordinated

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:84%
by NATO, run by the European
military's secret services,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
in close cooperation with
the CIA and British MI6.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Trained with US Green Berets
and British Special Air

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Service, that is, the
SIS, Gladio operatives

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.230 align:middle line:90%
were top of the line.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
The Gladio network
covered pretty much

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
all the NATO
countries, including

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Belgium, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Italy,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Spain, and Turkey,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
as well as the neutral European
countries of Austria, Finland,

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:90%
Sweden, and Switzerland.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So that makes some
sense, we can imagine.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:84%
In the event of a major Red
Army invasion of Western Europe,

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
there would be a well-armed
packet of resistance

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:90%
in various places.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But of course, there
was no such invasion.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Year after year, secret
groups, coordinated

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:84%
by the CIA and NATO,
horded stockpiles

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and honed their expertise
in explosives, sabotage,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
guerrilla warfare,
and assassinations,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.880 align:middle line:84%
with nothing to do except
sit around and what?

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Wait for the invasion?

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.252 align:middle line:84%
Well, not all of these groups
sat around, it turns out.

00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:84%
They were worried
about local communists.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.240 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:84%
The Italian organization,
in particular,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
is known to have engaged
in domestic acts of bombing

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:90%
and murder.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
These included
several known bombings

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
during the 1970s, and
a particularly bad one

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.750 align:middle line:84%
at the train station in the
city of Bologna, in 1980.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.380 align:middle line:90%
That was the most notorious.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.466 align:middle line:90%
85 people there were killed.

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:37.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In the case of this bombing,
there was initial speculation

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.279 align:middle line:84%
that it might have been from
the communist group known

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:90%
as the Red Brigade.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But speculation quickly centered
on right wing neo-fascists,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:84%
which was absolutely true,
since the Gladio operatives,

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:90%
by and large, were that.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the connections
here are deeply nebulous

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and get us into some deep
secret society connections.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:10%
In particular, the
Bologna bombing,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:10%
while connected to Gladio,
also seems likely connected

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.940 align:middle line:10%
to another related clandestine
Italian organization,

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:10%
Propaganda Due, or P2.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
This was originally a kind
of Masonic lodge that,

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
after the Second
World War, morphed

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:84%
into a neo-fascist
secret society.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Many, many high
members of government

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
belonged to it,
and no surprise, it

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
turns out that P2 had
longstanding connections

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.040 align:middle line:90%
to US intelligence.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Back in the early
1970s, it was reportedly

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
a meeting between
President Nixon's Chief

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:84%
of Staff, Alexander
Haig, who would later

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
become head of NATO, and Ronald
Reagan's Secretary of State,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
with the notorious
Licio Gelli, head of P2

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and for years a
fugitive in Argentina.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.920 align:middle line:84%
This information came from
high-level CIA officer Theodore

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Shackley, the CIA deputy
station chief in Rome.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
After this meeting, money
was filtered to Gladio,

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:84%
with the blessing and
knowledge of both Haig

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and the then head of
the US National Security

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Council, Henry Kissinger.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Their aim was to prevent a
Communist takeover of Italy.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
How funding a
neo-fascist terror group

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
would accomplish this goal
is the $64,000 question.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
There is an answer
to that question.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Funding terror groups like
P2 and the Gladio operation

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
was done in order to demonize
the left, when possible,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
and to frighten the
public into supporting

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.150 align:middle line:84%
ever greater powers for the
national security state.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Overall, probably
hundreds of people

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
were killed in the Italian
segment of the Gladio program.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
One operative,
Vincenzo Vinciguerra,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
a Gladio terrorist
serving a life sentence

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
for murdering policemen, gave a
very simple reason for Gladio.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.895 align:middle line:84%
It was designed, he
said, quote, "to force

00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:84%
these people, the
Italian public,

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
to turn to the state to
ask for greater security.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
This," he said, "is the
political logic that lies

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
behind all the massacres and
the bombings which remain

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:84%
unpunished because the state
cannot convict or declare

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
itself responsible for
what happened," end quote.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.970 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a particular act
of betrayal when one's own

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.420 align:middle line:84%
government is
behind such things.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it's especially
hard for people

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
to think of governments
as acting in such a way.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
After all, we expect our
governments to protect us.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.070 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the
number one thing

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
any citizen expects
of their government--

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
not to kill its own citizens
or deliberately terrorize them.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:90%
And in beautiful Italy?

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes, in Italy.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
When the program finally
came to public attention,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
it was confirmed by a former
Italian prime minister,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:84%
an Italian judge,
and the former head

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:90%
of Italian counterintelligence.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:10%
The last of these was
General Gianadelio Maletti

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:10%
who stated point blank that
NATO carried out these terror

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:10%
bombings in Italy, with the
help of the Pentagon and CIA,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:10%
and then made sure the
Communists were blamed.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But did this kind of activity
happen elsewhere in Europe?

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, it did.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And it had different
names in other countries.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:84%
In Austria, the name was
[NON-ENGLISH],, in Belgium,

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.850 align:middle line:90%
SDRA 8.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
In Britain, it was called
Stay Behind, in France,

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.630 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.270 align:middle line:84%
In Greece, it was called
Operation Sheepskin.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.050 align:middle line:84%
In Sweden, it was called
[NON-ENGLISH],, in Switzerland,

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
P26, in Turkey,
Special War Department.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
In Greece, operatives
there worked

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
through that country's
special forces, L-O-K, LOK,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and were instructed by the
CIA to spy on the public

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and prevent the left
from taking power.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.010 align:middle line:10%
In 1967, a LOK was involved
in the military coup

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:10%
which took place just
before national elections.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Over 10,000 people were
arrested during the coup.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
In Spain, Gladio
operatives murdered members

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.520 align:middle line:84%
of rival groups, and were
implicated in the 1977 murder

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.670 align:middle line:84%
in Madrid of five people linked
with the Spanish Communist

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Party, known as the
Massacre of Atocha.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
In Portugal, a Gladio
group was set up

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
in 1966, in which all
members were trained in,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:84%
well, terrorism,
that is, bombings,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:84%
silent assassinations,
subversion techniques,

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.100 align:middle line:84%
clandestine
infiltration, and more.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
What did they do
with that knowledge?

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't have records
of their activities.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:84%
In Norway, a Gladio group
was established in the 1950s,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
involving itself in
psychological warfare

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and allegedly blacklisting
undesirable Norwegians.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
There was a Gladio
operation in Germany,

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:84%
although we don't know
much about its activities

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
except that US intelligence
helped to set it up,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
thanks to CIA documents
released in 2006.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
As early as 1949,
the CIA organized

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
networks of German agents,
which included at least

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.930 align:middle line:84%
two former Nazi SS
members in one unit,

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and another unit, which was run
by Lieutenant Colonel Walter

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Kopp, a former German army
officer, referred to by the CIA

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:90%
as an unreconstructed Nazi.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.709 align:middle line:84%
The German Gladio operation was
broken up in 1953 over fears

00:13:22.709 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that the neo-Nazis
in the group would

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:84%
be exposed in the West
German press, in other words,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.800 align:middle line:84%
not because the Americans
had reservations

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
about working with Nazis, but
that people would find out.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:84%
The frustration with
Gladio is that we are still

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:84%
met with denials
by the CIA and NATO

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
with many aspects and claims
dealing with its operations.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:84%
In all likelihood, most of
the covert ops done by Gladio

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
will not see the light of day.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
But some of the Italian
operations have been confirmed

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and are there for
the public record.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:84%
It would seem unusual
that they would

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
be the only ones doing
such dirty dealings

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:90%
against their own public.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:84%
We do know, however,
that Gladio wasn't

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:84%
just about an impending
Soviet invasion, which,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:84%
after all, never
happened, but it

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
was about preventing
left-wing governments

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
from taking power and
people-directed social

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:84%
movements from
gaining acceptance.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The false flag nature
of Gladio is evident--

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
create violent and
spectacular events

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that frighten and
traumatize the population

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:90%
toward a political solution.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:90%
But did Gladio work?

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.690 align:middle line:84%
As far as I can
see, it doesn't seem

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:84%
to have done anything
tangible except kill people.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Gladio is interesting as a
false flag, because you could

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
say its purpose was
defensive in the sense

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that it was intended to prevent
something from happening.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I suppose you could say
that, since Western Europe

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
did not succumb to communism,
that Gladio was a success.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think that would be a very
distorted reading of history.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:84%
There is no evidence that
Gladio bombings and terror

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
did anything
substantive other than

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.185 align:middle line:90%
to kill and terrorize people.

00:14:59.185 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
The Gladio was Europe's version
of illegal domestic disruption.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
The US counterpart to
that was COINTELPRO.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:10%
This stood for the FBI's
counter intelligence program,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:10%
which was a series of
secret and often illegal

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:10%
activities carried
out by the Bureau.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:84%
The point was to spy on,
infiltrate, discredit,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and disrupt political
enemies and groups that

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:90%
were considered subversive.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
COINTELPRO ran from 1956
through the early 1970s, when

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
it was discovered by the
public, and was the brainchild

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.396 align:middle line:90%
of FBI director J Edgar Hoover.

00:15:34.396 --> 00:15:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> From his office, J Edgar
Hoover has placed on the entire

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
organization his own rigid
code of service, integrity,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.640 align:middle line:90%
and morality.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:84%
In a way that is true
of few organizations,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:90%
J Edgar Hoover is the FBI.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is our story, the
story of a man, an organization,

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and their service to the
nation, a story of fidelity,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.116 align:middle line:90%
bravery, integrity.

00:15:57.116 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Unlike Gladio over in Europe,
we have very good documentation

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:90%
on COINTELPRO.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Records from the FBI show that
the program targeted protesters

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:84%
against the war in Vietnam,
civil rights and Black Power

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
movement, for instance,
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And the Black Panther Party.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:84%
It also targeted
feminist organizations,

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
anti-colonial movements, such
as Puerto Rican independence

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:84%
groups, like the Young
Lords, and really the entire

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.270 align:middle line:10%
of these movements, and
especially their leaders.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about
domestic movements

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
that were clearly working
to create political change--

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.160 align:middle line:84%
I think we are inclined
to say positive change--

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
but were treated as
enemy combatants.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:84%
The program started
in August 1956

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.300 align:middle line:84%
against the American
Communist Party,

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
with tactics like IRS audits,
anonymous phone calls designed

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:84%
to divide and
intimidate members,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and also by creating
fake documents that

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:84%
would cause dissension
within the organization.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Later that year, the FBI
targeted black leaders

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:84%
on the pretext that the
Civil Rights Movement

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.040 align:middle line:90%
was infiltrated by Communists.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:10%
In 1957, the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:10%
was founded.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
This turned out to be
the most important of all

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
the civil rights
organizations, and they

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
were immediately monitored,

Reverend Martin Luther
King, Jr. Things

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%

for King after the 1963

him like full court press.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
That led to blackmail
of the worst kind.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
The FBI sent at least one
anonymous package to King

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
with audio recordings
of sexual indiscretions

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and a letter trying to convince
him to commit suicide or else

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
the audio recording
would be released.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:16.495 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work.

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:20.140 align:middle line:84%
But then there was the bullet
that killed him in 1968.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The FBI hounded
King even after he

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
died, doing everything
possible to smear his legacy.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
COINTELPRO also
targeted Malcolm X

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:84%
by infiltrating his organization
and sparking angry debates

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:90%

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
of the FBI's involvement in
his death will never be known.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:10%
COINTELPRO went after many
other groups during the 1960s,

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.590 align:middle line:10%
all designed towards
disruption and sabotage

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:10%
against the entire spectrum of
left-leaning political groups,

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:10%
from the Socialist
Workers Party,

and the entire anti-war
movement, all the civil rights

and black power organizations,
including the Black Panther

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Party, which was severely
undermined by infiltration

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.060 align:middle line:10%
of provocateurs who
incited violence

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:10%
that was designed to discredit
the group in the public mind.

>> The Black Panther Party
feels very much the same way.

00:19:29.973 --> 00:19:33.220 align:middle line:84%
We think that this educational

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's the people that
will cause the revolution,

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%

that will cause

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.856 align:middle line:90%
the change in the country.

00:19:38.856 --> 00:19:40.230 align:middle line:84%
The Black Panther
Party is simply

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.190 align:middle line:84%
the vanguard of the
revolution, and we

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:84%
plan to teach the
people the strategy

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:84%
and the necessary tools
to liberate themselves.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:10%
>> COINTELPRO also infiltrated
groups on the right,

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.200 align:middle line:10%
including many religious groups,
and even the Ku Klux Klan.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Some might look at
organizations like the KKK

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, what's
wrong with that?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.560 align:middle line:84%
After all, they're
a hateful group.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.650 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that the
FBI made its own decisions

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
as to what groups it
could extra judicially

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.260 align:middle line:90%
infiltrate and discredit.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
J Edgar Hoover considered
Martin Luther King

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
to be a purveyor of hate,
too, which most of us

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:90%
today would not agree with.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:84%
I would say here
that, once we go down

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
a path of deciding who should
be allowed to speak freely

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and who should not, we chip away
at the foundation of freedom

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:84%
If freedom is only valid for
those whose opinions we agree

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:90%
with, well, that isn't freedom.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the FBI worked
very hard to completely control

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:84%
American public
discourse into channels

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that it considered-- well, that
J Edgar Hoover considered--

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.610 align:middle line:84%
to be acceptable, a rather
limited channel indeed.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, the
whole nefarious program

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:10%
was exposed in
1971, when activists

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:10%
broke into an FBI office.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it was
only illegal activity,

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
in this case, that was able to
bring attention to a seriously

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:90%
illegal US government activity.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:84%
A couple of other things
about COINTELPRO--

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.280 align:middle line:84%
first, it's worth noting
that the program was probably

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
started after the Supreme
Court had made rulings

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.760 align:middle line:84%
in the 1950s that limited
the government's power

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.274 align:middle line:90%
to attack dissident groups.

00:21:18.274 --> 00:21:19.690 align:middle line:84%
That, of course,
can be considered

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:90%
the mark of a free society.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Free societies, after all,
allow people to dissent.

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.100 align:middle line:84%
In any case, the
FBI's answer was

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:84%
simply to attack those groups
covertly and illegally.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the main reasons
false flags, in general,

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.350 align:middle line:90%
take place.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.710 align:middle line:84%
After all, if you can rule with
complete dictatorial power,

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
why would you need false flags
and other forms of deception?

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, we can see that
societies that are free,

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:84%
in practice or even in theory,
are vulnerable to false flags.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Controllers and would be
dictators never go away.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And if they can't
get their way openly,

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.230 align:middle line:84%
they will work
secretly, by deception.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.970 align:middle line:84%
The other thing to
note is that the FBI

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the only American
organization covertly

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.185 align:middle line:84%
infiltrating American politics
and culture and social action

00:22:07.185 --> 00:22:07.985 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:22:07.985 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:10%
The CIA was also
involved in something

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.580 align:middle line:10%
called Operation CHAOS.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:10%
We don't have
evidence that CHAOS

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:10%
did the kind of propagations
that the FBI was doing.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:84%
But the program did spy on
many of the same groups,

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.500 align:middle line:84%
including the Black
Panthers and the SDS.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
The legality of this
program was questionable,

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
to say the least, and went
against the CIA's charter,

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that its activities were
supposed to be outside the US.

>> But with the Soviet threat
and the Cold War heating up,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:84%
their great
communist revolution,

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that had brought them
equality and prosperity,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84%
was in the process of
being betrayed by traitors,

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
especially within the Communist
Party, who were secretly

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.570 align:middle line:90%
planning to restore capitalism.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Chairman Mao tempered
and nurtured our party

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:84%
in the struggles it carried out
under his leadership against

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.160 align:middle line:84%
class enemies at home
and abroad, and inside,

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:90%
and outside the party.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, this
was all nonsense.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But it came from Mao,
so it had to be true.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:90%
The word went out--

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:84%
true communism had
to be preserved.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
The traitors and capitalists
had to be wiped out

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.890 align:middle line:90%
through violent class struggle.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:84%
His solution was
pure, evil genius.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese people all needed
to adopt Mao's own form

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
of communist philosophy,
Maoism, as their personal guide

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:90%
And wow, did this work.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
The youth of China,
especially, got into it.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.450 align:middle line:84%
They formed Red Guard
groups around the country.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.270 align:middle line:10%
A pamphlet of the wise
sayings of Mao Zedong,

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.720 align:middle line:10%
known as the Little Red Book,
was seen everywhere in China,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.830 align:middle line:10%
and was read and
studied everywhere,

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:10%
especially by the youth.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
The word revisionists,
Mao's word

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
for the so-called traitors,
became like a swear word

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.350 align:middle line:90%
in China.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Fanatics began looking at
anyone in the country who

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.990 align:middle line:90%
wasn't as fanatic as they were.

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:84%
They created what were
called struggle sessions

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and re-education sessions,
where they would single out

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
someone they didn't like and
surround them with invective

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and shaming, to get
them to admit what

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
a horrible person that they
had been and how they had been,

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
indeed, secretly working
to betray the revolution.

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Often, those people were
killed, and even more,

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:84%
they were dispossessed of
their home and property

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.210 align:middle line:84%
and sent to work in the
fields so that they could

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.670 align:middle line:90%
learn to be better communists.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:54.910 align:middle line:84%
The Cultural Revolution
became a national obsession

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.170 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
rest of the 1960s.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And it spread everywhere-- to
the military, into the cities,

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.670 align:middle line:84%
into the countryside, and within
the Communist Party leadership

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.840 align:middle line:84%
It paralyzed China
and seriously damaged

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:84%
its economy and society,
aside from the fact

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that it created unbelievable
suffering for millions

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.090 align:middle line:90%
and millions of people.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.770 align:middle line:84%
But what it also
did, of course, was

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:84%
to divide the entire society
against itself everywhere.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big point of
all the Cultural Revolution--

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.860 align:middle line:84%
in the top leadership,
it led to a mass purge

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:90%
of senior officials.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:90%
So let's ask a question.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Why did the Cultural
Revolution really happen?

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
really ugly part.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:43.840 align:middle line:84%
The Cultural Revolution happened
because, in reality, Mao Zedong

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:84%
had lost a great
deal of his power,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and used this so-called
revolution to take it back.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You see, he had led
the communists in China

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
to a successful seizure
of power, back in 1949.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:84%
But by the end of the
1950s, his policies

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.620 align:middle line:84%
had been so ruinous
to the way people

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:84%
grew food and
manufactured goods,

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:84%
that a horrific famine
happened that killed

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:90%
perhaps 10 million people.

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It was so bad that
even the great Mao

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:84%
lost a lot of credibility
among the Communist leadership

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:90%
in China.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So what they did
by the early 1960s

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:84%
was effectively boot
him out of power.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But they kept him
on as a figurehead,

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:84%
because he had been the
face of the revolution.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, that turned out to
be a really big mistake

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:30.410 align:middle line:90%
on their part.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:84%
They should have formally
taken him out of power

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:34.060 align:middle line:84%
and explained to
the nation that he

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.410 align:middle line:84%
was the one responsible
for the horrible famine.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't, because
they thought they needed him.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mao did not like being
out of the loop, not at all.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.510 align:middle line:10%
He planned his return
to power, and by 1966,

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:10%
had developed the brilliant idea
to whip up a public relations

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:10%
campaign that would go
around the party leadership.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So he used what was
called the Cultural

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Revolution, in reality, to
purge his political enemies.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
The Cultural Revolution
damaged everything good

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.250 align:middle line:90%
in Chinese society.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Aside from the
national paralysis

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:84%
it created, it especially
damaged human relationships.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
People turned on each other,
often in the most vicious ways.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Friends and family members,
those precious bonds

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that every human being
needs and craves,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:84%
these were broken over and
over again, millions of times.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can be sure that
the millions of followers

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:84%
of the Cultural
Revolution had no idea

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that they were being played as
suckers in a political power

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.470 align:middle line:90%
struggle.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.110 align:middle line:84%
They destroyed the
lives of so many people,

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:38.470 align:middle line:84%
all for the sake of one
man, the Chairman Mao.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Mao Zedong, once
a lowly party worker,

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.850 align:middle line:84%
now assumed the stature of
a dominant figure in all

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:90%
of eastern Asia.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether a false flag is
caused by a covert op team like

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Gladio operatives or involves
a political system that creates

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.840 align:middle line:84%
a fake enemy
committing fake crimes,

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:84%
both involve a conscious,
Goebbels-like commitment

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate, frighten,
and deceive the public

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:84%
into submitting to authority,
all based on fraudulent

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So what we see here is
that, during the 1950s

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and '60s, various governments
began a significant effort

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.610 align:middle line:84%
to influence public opinion
through covert means--

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
disruption, provocation,
sneers, and even

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:84%
murder and assassination, the
tools we ascribe to terrorism.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.360 align:middle line:84%
But these were
used by governments

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.710 align:middle line:84%
for the stated cause of
freedom and liberation.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:84%
If they had a motto,
it would be something

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:37.650 align:middle line:84%
like achieving freedom through
deception and manipulation.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
If it sounds Orwellian to
you, that's because it is.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
We looked at events in
the US, Europe, and China.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.310 align:middle line:84%
In one of those regions,
China, control over the media

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:90%
was overt and unquestioned.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's worth noting here that,
during all this period, the US

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.670 align:middle line:84%
government, through
the CIA, was exercising

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:84%
profound secret control
over its news, as well.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:06.294 align:middle line:10%
>> At CBS, we had been
contacted by the CIA.

00:30:06.294 --> 00:30:07.710 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, by the time I

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.930 align:middle line:84%
became the head of the whole
news and public affairs

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.270 align:middle line:84%
operation in 1954, the
shifts had been established.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was told
about them and asked

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.470 align:middle line:90%
if I carried on with them.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>> This was Operation
Mockingbird.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't exposed
until the 1970s.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.170 align:middle line:84%
But Mockingbird involved paid
relationships between the CIA

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and over 400 mainstream
American journalists,

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:31.882 align:middle line:84%
who were secretly working
on behalf of the agency.

00:30:31.882 --> 00:30:33.840 align:middle line:10%
You could say they were
doing what they thought

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:10%
was their patriotic
duty, sure, and also

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.850 align:middle line:10%
ask yourself what it
meant that millions

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.310 align:middle line:10%
of Americans and
people around the world

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:10%
were relying on
what they believed

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:45.160 align:middle line:10%
were independent
journalists, when, in fact,

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.490 align:middle line:10%
many of those journalists
were doing nothing

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.610 align:middle line:10%
other than propaganda
work for the government.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:10%
>> I thought that it was a
matter of real concern that

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:10%
planted stories intended to
serve a national purpose abroad

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:10%
came home and were circulated
here and believed here,

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:10%
because this would mean that the
CIA could manipulate the news

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.190 align:middle line:10%
in the United States by
channeling it through some

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.300 align:middle line:10%
foreign country.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're looking at
that very carefully.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And ask yourself what
you personally could do.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.670 align:middle line:84%
If you had secret influence
over 400 mainstream journalists,

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.980 align:middle line:84%
could you control
the news completely?

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, probably not, but could
you exert major influence?

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Could you kill stories you
didn't like through ridicule

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:90%
and editorial policy?

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Could you even plant
smears and false stories

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:90%
when you needed them?

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you could;
and Europe, same story--

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.190 align:middle line:84%
behind the scenes
of manipulation

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:84%
by the major
intelligence agencies,

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.170 align:middle line:84%
from CIA to Britain's
MI6, and the agencies

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.970 align:middle line:90%
from the other NATO countries.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.650 align:middle line:90%
But don't think it stopped.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Manipulation and control over
mainstream news and culture

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.810 align:middle line:90%
is greater than ever.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Next time on False Flags--

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.470 align:middle line:84%
the Cold War and how
the United States

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:11.285 align:middle line:84%
became the undisputed master
of the art of the false flag.

00:32:11.285 --> 00:32:12.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, some
people might think

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.120 align:middle line:84%
that all this talk about false
flags and nasty government

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.620 align:middle line:90%
activities is upsetting.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.480 align:middle line:90%
But what I would say is this.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:84%
The art of personal
development for each one of us

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:84%
requires us to shed the many
illusions that have surrounded

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.430 align:middle line:90%
us all our lives.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Illusions are painful to shed.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But once they are gone, we
enter a truly higher reality.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.570 align:middle line:90%
So don't fear the red pill.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if you seek
transformation,

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:84%
you need truth as your
constant companion.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm Richard Dolan,
until next time.
