00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:05.725 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: I'm Richard
Dolan, and this is False Flags.

00:00:05.725 --> 00:00:17.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.380 align:middle line:10%
Even after all these years,
when most people think of evil,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.170 align:middle line:10%
in all likelihood, they
think of Hitler and the Nazis

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:10%
as the epitome of evil, so much
so that you could consider it

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:10%
a cliche.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.452 align:middle line:90%
But the Nazis made it easy.

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it didn't
help when they

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:84%
decided it was a great idea
to conquer all of Europe.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But the real thing about
them is that while, yes,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.720 align:middle line:84%
many other societies and people
engaged in horrible destruction

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and death, the Nazi
party of Germany

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.330 align:middle line:84%
was just so brutal and
generally so explicit

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
about what they
were doing and doing

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
things on such a grand scale,
that we are justifiably

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.902 align:middle line:90%
horrified by them.

00:00:53.902 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
They were even pretty upfront
about their willingness

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:90%
to deceive others.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, on what they felt was
their necessity to deceive.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Hermann Goring was
one of the most

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%
notorious of the Nazi leaders.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
For most of the time
of the Third Reich,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.225 align:middle line:84%
he was the number two man in
all of Germany next to Hitler.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Allied armies
had taken into custody men

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:84%
like Hermann Goring,
Luftwaffe chief

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and right-hand man of Adolph
Hitler since the earliest

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Nazi years.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: A cruel,
power hungry man,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
he was remarkably candid
after the war ended,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
while in custody at the
Nuremberg trials in 1946.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.080 align:middle line:84%
He even talked
about false flags.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
In perhaps his most
infamous remark, he said,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.620 align:middle line:84%
quote, naturally, the common
people don't want war,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:84%
but after all, it is the
leaders of a country who

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
determine the policy, and
it is always a simple matter

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
to drag the people
along, whether it

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
is a democracy or a
fascist dictatorship

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:84%
or a parliament or a
communist dictatorship.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Voice or no voice,
the people can always

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
be brought to the
bidding of the leaders.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:90%
That is easy.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:84%
All you have to
do is to tell them

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
they are being attacked and
denounce the pacifists for lack

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of patriotism and exposing
the country to danger.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.136 align:middle line:84%
It works the same
in every country.

00:02:12.136 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:10%
ROBERT H. JACKSON:
The principles

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:10%
of the authoritarian government,
which you set up required,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.420 align:middle line:10%
as I understand you, that there
be tolerated no opposition

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:10%
political parties,
which might defeat

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:10%
or obstruct the policy
of the Nazi party.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, Goring's cynicism
was matched by Joseph Goebbels,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.240 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
fanatic of all Nazis

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and who ran Nazi Germany's
Ministry of Propaganda.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was called that,
which, when you think about it,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.170 align:middle line:84%
is not the best public
relations move you can imagine.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Goebbels however,
was very advanced

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.030 align:middle line:84%
when it came to
public manipulation.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:84%
He had a simple approach,
simple but very effective.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Lie repeatedly.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Just lie and keep lying.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.740 align:middle line:84%
He often said that a lie
told once is only a lie,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
but if you tell it 1,000
times, it becomes the truth.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And even more famously,
he said, quote,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:84%
"if you tell the same lie enough
times, people will believe it

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.200 align:middle line:84%
and the bigger the lie,
the better," end quote.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
We often think of Nazi
propaganda as simple and crude,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
which it surely was, but that
did not make it ineffective.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:10%
Goebbels worked
on the assumption

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:10%
that most people are
simple creatures.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.260 align:middle line:10%
Primitive was the word he used.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, he
said, propaganda

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.768 align:middle line:90%
had to be simple and repetitive.

00:03:33.768 --> 00:03:41.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:10%
Among the repulsive
qualities of these Nazis,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:10%
it's the explicit
racism that stands out,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:10%
specifically the demonization
of the Jewish people,

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:10%
as well as many other
categories the Nazis described

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.140 align:middle line:10%
as subhuman--

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:10%
Slavic peoples, gypsies,
people of color,

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.220 align:middle line:10%
and well, anyone not categorized
as Aryan, that is Germanic.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.370 align:middle line:84%
We all know this, but what's
important for our purposes

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.730 align:middle line:84%
is how the demonization of
non-Germans, and specifically

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Jews, qualifies
as a form of false flag.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's call it a soft false
flag, akin to the Inquisition

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.010 align:middle line:84%
of earlier centuries, in which
a message was hammered home

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
over and over to
the German people,

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:84%
that all the problems in society
were because of the Jews.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It's important to see why
this idea could be successful.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Germany, after the
First World War,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
was a nation lying
flat on its back.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
They had just lost the
war, millions of dead,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and they had been
humiliated by what they felt

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:90%
was an unfair peace treaty.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't understand.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make sense to them.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, during the
1920s came economic problems,

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
including run away
inflation and then the Great

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.880 align:middle line:90%
Depression of the early 1930s.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And there was more than
enough misery to go around.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Who was responsible?

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Hitler had his answer--

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.560 align:middle line:90%
the Jews.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
The demonization of
the Jews, of course,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
is very well known
to history but what

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:84%
we might want to
remind ourselves

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.040 align:middle line:84%
of is how profitable it
was to certain groups,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
especially those thieves
in the Nazi party

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:84%
who stole Jewish
property and ran them out

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:84%
of positions of prominence
that they could then

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:90%
assume themselves.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.240 align:middle line:84%
A blatant struggle
for power and wealth

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that was also
useful for cementing

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.814 align:middle line:90%
power of the ruling party.

00:05:28.814 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Of course, none
of that would have

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
worked without a campaign
of intimidation and terror,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
which the Nazis
implemented in abundance.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Louder and
far more terrifying

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.200 align:middle line:84%
than the growls of Mussolini
were the calculated threats

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
of the man, who
for six long years,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.609 align:middle line:84%
had been the specter haunting
Europe's uneasy peace.

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: The
demonization of the Jews

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
was truly a false flag
served to the public.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:90%
A fake problem was created.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
The Jews stabbed Germany in the
back and lost the Great War.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:84%
A constant campaign
of demonization

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
was continued, all
with the intention

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
of making the Jews an
object of fear and loathing.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
A solution was proposed
and implemented.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Eliminate the Jews.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And the real benefit
to the perpetrators

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
was to steal Jewish wealth
and cement their position

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.420 align:middle line:90%
in the power structure.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:84%
This was accomplished through
a combination of terror

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:84%
over the population and control
over all forms of information.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Goebbels, Goring,
and of course, Hitler

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
himself, these men all
sought total control

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.860 align:middle line:84%
over German intellectual
and cultural life.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Goebbels had total
control over what

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
was printed in German
books and newspapers, what

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
was said over German
radio, and what

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
was allowed to be expressed
in German movies, the arts,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:90%
public meetings, and rallies.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Opposing viewpoints were
censored or eliminated

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:90%
from all media.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps I'm getting
ahead of myself.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.360 align:middle line:84%
How did the Nazis even
get to do all of this?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
the infamous Reichstag

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:90%
fire of 1933.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Hans
Gisevius, a witness

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:84%
who formerly held a high
position in the Berlin police

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:84%
administration tells of his
investigation of the Reichstag

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:90%
fire.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.190 align:middle line:84%
First of all, he ascertained
that quite generally, Hitler

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
had stated the wish for
a large-scale propaganda

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:90%
campaign.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Goebbels took on the job of
making the necessary proposals,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and it was Goebbels who
first thought of setting

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:90%
the Reichstag on fire.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: After its defeat at
the end of the First World War,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Germany's old imperial
government led by the Kaiser

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
was gone, and a new form of
government, new for Germany,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:90%
anyway, came into being--

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:90%
a republic.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Many Germans welcomed
the new situation.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Sure, they had lost
the war, but there

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
was a freedom in 1920s
Germany that many found

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.080 align:middle line:90%
like a breath of fresh air.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:84%
People could say what they
wanted, dress how they wanted,

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
live the kind of life that they
wanted to a much greater degree

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.780 align:middle line:90%
than they could in the past.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, some Germans
hated the new system

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and associated it not only with
the loss of the First World War

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
but with everything that was
wrong with modern, decadent

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.805 align:middle line:10%
In this context, the
Nazis led the charge.

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:21.290 align:middle line:84%
But not many people
paid attention to them

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
until the Great
Depression started in 1929

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:84%
to spread panic
in Germany and put

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
millions of people out of work.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.210 align:middle line:84%
In such an extreme setting,
more and more people

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
were drawn to extreme
answers, and suddenly, Hitler

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.940 align:middle line:84%
found himself in the
national spotlight.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Then, on January
30th, 1933, he was

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:84%
selected to be Chancellor,
that is, essentially,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.415 align:middle line:90%
Prime Minister of Germany.

00:08:47.415 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Adolph
Hitler, leader

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of a German national movement
is made Chancellor of Germany,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and Berlin goes wild in
celebration of his victory.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Torch lights parade
light the Berlin night

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
as backers commemorate
his victory

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:84%
by marching through the streets
and through the Brandenburg

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.887 align:middle line:90%
Gate.

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I'll just
emphasize that he was not

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
elected but selected by
Germany's President Paul Von

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Hindenburg, the senile old
general from World War I,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
because Hitler was the
leader of then the largest

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:90%
party in Germany.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Germany, in 1933, was still a
democratic society with laws

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:90%
respecting human rights.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:90%
So how did things go so wrong?

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, less than a month
later, on February 27th, 1933,

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and just one week before
general elections,

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:84%
the German Reichstag
was set on fire.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:84%
This was the home of
Germany's Parliament.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Hitler immediately announced
that communist terrorists

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:90%
were responsible.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
His right-hand
man, Hermann Goring

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
claimed to have secret
evidence proving

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
that the communists did it
and said that he would soon

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:90%
make this evidence public.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: It was
expected from Goring

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and he gave his assurances
that he would do so,

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that the police
would be instructed,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
while still
suffering from shock,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%
to take up a false trail.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Hitler then
convinced Hindenburg

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:90%
to sign the Reichstag Decree.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
This decree, using defense
against terrorism as an excuse,

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
suspended just about every
major civil liberty that existed

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:90%
in Germany's Constitution.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Habeas corpus,
which is the right

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:84%
to know why you're
being put in jail--

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:90%
this was taken away.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Freedom of the press, gone.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Freedom to organize
and assemble, gone.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
The Reichstag Decree even
allowed the government

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:84%
to spy on its own citizens'
personal mail and telephone

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.530 align:middle line:90%
conversations without a warrant.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:84%
All of this broke the back
of Germany's free society.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.550 align:middle line:90%
So what about the fire?

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, the only thing
historians seem to agree on

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:10%
is that Marinus Van der Lubbe
a former Dutch communist

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:10%
and mentally disturbed
arsonist hungry for fame,

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.290 align:middle line:10%
was found inside the building.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.360 align:middle line:84%
After being tortured
by the Gestapo,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:84%
he confessed to
starting the fire

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:90%
but always said he acted alone.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Goring didn't believe him,
or wouldn't believe him,

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and ordered the arrest
of several leading

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.330 align:middle line:90%
communists in Germany.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, that came to nothing
since the courts found

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
zero evidence against any
of the other communists,

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
and they were acquitted.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Van der Lubbe, on the other
hand, was a different story.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.600 align:middle line:84%
He was not apparently
very intelligent,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and he also had a great
desire for attention.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Once he persuaded
the German press

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
that he was going to swim
across the English Channel.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
He actually went to
the coast, greased up

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and ready to go, with
photographers and reporters

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:36.770 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:84%
He went out for a few
yards and swam right back,

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.330 align:middle line:84%
saying the currents
weren't favorable.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Another time, following a
strike at his workplace,

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Van der Lubbe offered to
accept full responsibility

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and take any punishment as long
as no one else was punished.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
His employers clearly
did not believe

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:84%
he had any major
involvement in the strike.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So his behavior at the trial
was described as bizarre.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
In a fascinating book on mind
control by Dutch psychiatrist,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
A. M. Meerloo, Van der
Lubbe showed all the signs

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of extreme coercion
while in custody.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:84%
He had previously been a patient
in a Dutch mental institution

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and was known by
psychiatrists there

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
to be upbeat, alert, although
with moods that would change

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
on a dime and with
all kinds of fantasies

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.890 align:middle line:90%
about changing the world.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But during the court
sessions, Van der Lubbe

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:84%
only answered questions
with a yes or no.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.080 align:middle line:90%
He seemed dull and apathetic.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Then, after more than
40 days of the trial,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:90%
his apathy suddenly disappeared.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
He complained that the
trial was taking too long,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and he demanded his punishment,
either by imprisonment

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:90%
or death.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
He said he started
the fire as a cry

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
to rally the German workers
against fascist rule.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.880 align:middle line:84%
He talked about
his inner voices,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and then he fell
back into apathy.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The psychiatrist, Meerloo,
writing about this,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
stated that such
behavior is often

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:84%
found in cases of
extreme mental coercion.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Van der Lubbe was
convicted and executed.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:84%
A number of people
right away suspected

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:90%
the Nazis of being behind this.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.400 align:middle line:10%
Indeed, Goring himself
was widely suspected.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
A man named [INAUDIBLE],,
the Berlin correspondent

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
for a major Vienna
newspaper, reported

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
on the night of the fire,
quote, "there can scarcely

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:84%
be any doubt that the fire which
is now destroying the Reichstag

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.150 align:middle line:84%
was set by henchmen of
the Hitler government."

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:84%
By all appearances,
the arsonists

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.630 align:middle line:84%
used an underground passage
connecting the Reichstag

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to the palace of its
president, Hermann Goring.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Goring himself is said to
have admitted to the deed.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.460 align:middle line:84%
This is according to German
general Franz Halder, who

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.710 align:middle line:84%
stated in an
affidavit that Goring

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:84%
bragged about setting the fire
in a conversation in 1943.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.840 align:middle line:84%
During conversation about
the Reichstag building,

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Halder said he heard
Goring say loudly,

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.300 align:middle line:84%
the only one who really knows
about the Reichstag building

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:90%
is I, for I set fire to it.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.210 align:middle line:84%
In saying this, he
slapped his thigh.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:84%
For the record, Goring denied
this at the Nuremberg trials

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.190 align:middle line:90%
in 1946.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Using
the Reichstag fire

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
as a pretext for seizing
power, the Nazi conspirators

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.964 align:middle line:84%
lost no time in tearing Germany
away from a policy of peace.

00:14:19.964 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Many other
researchers and historians

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.820 align:middle line:84%
agree that Goring was involved
but also added the name

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:90%
of another man, Karl Ernst.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Ernst was the Berlin
leader of the stormtroopers

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:90%
known as the SA.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.060 align:middle line:10%
These were Hitler's brownshirts.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:84%
The journalist
William L. Shirer,

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:84%
in his classic book from 1964,
"The Rise and Fall of the Third

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Reich," also mentioned
the underground passage

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:84%
between the Reichstag
in Goring's residence.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Through this tunnel,
he wrote, Ernst

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
led a small detachment
of stormtroopers,

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
where they scattered
gasoline and incendiaries

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:90%
and then got out quickly.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.590 align:middle line:84%
We also have a
statement uncovered

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:84%
after years of obscurity
and publicized in 2001.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Several German historians
went through over 50,000 pages

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.970 align:middle line:84%
of previously
unexamined documents

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:84%
from former East German
and Soviet archives,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and they also concluded that
the fire was a Nazi plot.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:84%
They base their
case on remarks they

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:84%
found by Adolf Rawl, a thief
and a Nazi stormtrooper.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Rawl was serving a
sentence in a jail

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:84%
but told prosecutors the exact
same story about Karl Ernst

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and the stormtroopers
starting the fire.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
A bit of new information
from this research

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
was that Ernst gave
his men a reason

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
they needed to do
the fire, which

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
was that an excuse was needed
to go after the communists.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately for
Rawl, a stormtrooper

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:84%
working in the jail
learned of his statement

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:90%
and tipped off his comrades.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.030 align:middle line:84%
They then arranged
for Rawl's statements

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:84%
to be destroyed by accomplices
in the prosecutor's office

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
and for Rawl himself
to be murdered.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was, indeed,
murdered in November 1933.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Apparently a lot of people
suspected Karl Ernst

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.620 align:middle line:90%
of some sort of involvement.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:84%
He was once asked about
any connection he had,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
and he said, quote, if I said,
yes, I'd be a bloody fool.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:84%
If I said, no, I'd
be a bloody liar.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Despite all of this, seemingly,
a number of academic historians

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
maintain that Van der
Lubbe really did act alone

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.880 align:middle line:84%
and that the Nazis
simply were happy to use

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.860 align:middle line:84%
his foolishness
as an opportunity

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:90%
to crack down on society.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:84%
They maintain that there
is no definitive proof

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:90%
that the Nazis did it.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Evidently with some matches
and a hope and a dream,

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Van der Lubbe started a very
impressive fire all alone.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think I beg to differ.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Hitler
and all the top Nazis

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
were in Berlin on
the night of the fire

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and fairly close to the
building, despite the fact

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that this was just one week
before a national election

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:90%
in which they were all involved.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It's also interesting that
Goring had his arrest lists

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:84%
already prepared when he arrived
on the scene of the fire.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And on the very next day,
Hitler had his emergency decree

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:84%
already drafted and ready
for Hindenburg's signature.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
the Reichstag fire

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
is what we get from
many false flag events.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:84%
Even today, more
than 80 years later,

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
there is no full agreement
on who was behind it.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:84%
With enough testimony pointing
in the direction of the Nazis

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and certainly with the
motivation and immediate roll

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.640 align:middle line:84%
out of a solution,
we are certainly

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.520 align:middle line:90%
seeing the false flag profile.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.730 align:middle line:84%
There was one, and only one,
beneficiary of the Reichstag

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:84%
fire and that is the
Nazis themselves,

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:90%
and primarily Hitler himself.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
This cemented their grip on
power, which of course, they

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
held ruthlessly for
the next 12 years.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that
after all these years

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:84%
there's still speculation
about the Reichstag fire

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:84%
tells us something
very important.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Like any good false
flag, those responsible

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:90%
knew how to cover their tracks.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
There will probably
never be absolute proof.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, welcome to the
world of covert ops.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.240 align:middle line:84%
In any case, most of the German
people in a state of shock

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:84%
could not conceive that
their own government

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:90%
could have done such a thing.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.412 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of them were
supportive of the Nazi measures

00:18:17.412 --> 00:18:19.120 align:middle line:84%
that effectively killed
the republic they

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle line:84%
lived in and replaced
with a dictatorship.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:84%
They were safe from terrorists,
and that's all that mattered.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they didn't feel
that way, most of them

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:84%
were smart enough not
to speak up too loudly.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Adolph Hitler had
seized control of a floundering

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:84%
government in a time
of national crisis,

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and because he promised
to restore prosperity

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and national pride, he gained
the support of the people.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Now, I want to talk
about another Nazi false flag.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Unlike the Reichstag fire, about
which some historians still

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
argue, this one is not
a matter of debate.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:90%
The invasion of Poland--

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:84%
probably the most
classic undisputed

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:84%
false flag of the 20th century,
and the event that kicked off

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.270 align:middle line:90%
the Second World War in Europe.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The Nazis, in the
1930s, were looking

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:90%
to change the world, all right.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.980 align:middle line:84%
By 1939, Hitler had been
in power for six years.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:10%
He had achieved massive
foreign policy successes,

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:10%
enlarging Germany
substantially to include

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.220 align:middle line:10%
Austria and part
of Czechoslovakia,

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:10%
all in the name of
lebensraum or living

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:10%
space for the German people.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:84%
All of these victories
were won through diplomacy.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Not a shot was fired
to achieve them.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the summer of 1939,
Hitler was looking at Poland,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
but he realized that
there was no way

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:84%
he was going to take over that
country simply by diplomacy.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
He would need an
excuse to invade it.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So an operation was developed
under the authority of Reinhard

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Heydrich, one of the
most cold-blooded

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
of the Nazi killers and at one
point, the third most powerful

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.810 align:middle line:90%
man in the Third Reich.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Heydrich though, was
simply the senior executive

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:90%
of the operation.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It was really organized by a
Nazi named Alfred Naujocks, who

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:84%
gave an affidavit about the
whole affair after the war.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
What they planned to do
was to fabricate evidence

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:84%
of a Polish attack
against Germany

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to mobilize German
public opinion for war

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:90%
and to justify war with Poland.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Before the operation
was to take place,

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Hitler made sure he didn't
antagonize the great power

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.210 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of
Poland, the Soviet Union.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:84%
So on August 23rd,
he and Soviet leader

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Stalin
agreed to what they

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.900 align:middle line:90%
called a non-aggression pact.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:84%
In reality, it was a mutual
aggression pact against Poland,

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:90%
as we shall see.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
The date Hitler originally
set for the invasion of Poland

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:84%
was August 26th, 1939,
but that didn't happen.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
The global diplomatic
situation was still

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
too much in flux
for Hitler's liking

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and plans got pushed
back for a few days.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It turned out, however, that one
of the German undercover units

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.980 align:middle line:90%
was not informed of the delay.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So on August 26th, they began
their part of the false flag

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:84%
operation that Hitler would
use to justify the invasion.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.950 align:middle line:84%
This was carried out
by undercover agents,

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:14.080 align:middle line:84%
including the SS, all
dressed in Polish uniforms.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.030 align:middle line:90%
They did a number of things.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:84%
They carried out an attack on
a German customs post in which

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:90%
several Germans were killed.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:84%
They also stormed
various border buildings,

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:84%
scared the locals
with wild shots,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
carried out random acts of
vandalism, and then retreated.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:84%
One devious element was to
leave behind dead bodies

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:90%
in Polish uniforms.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
In reality, these
bodies were prisoners

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:90%
from concentration camps.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
They were dressed
in Polish uniforms,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
killed by lethal injection,
then shot for appearance,

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.530 align:middle line:90%
and then left behind.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Even though that event
happened on the wrong night,

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't a disaster from an
operational point of view.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But then, on the night
of August 31st, 1939,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
just before the
invasion was to begin,

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:90%
the main false flag happened.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
German covert operatives
went to a radio tower.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.530 align:middle line:84%
This was very close
to the Polish border,

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
near the Polish
town of Gleiwitz.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Then they seized
the radio station.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The station's music
program was interrupted

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:84%
by frantic German
voices announcing

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that Polish formations
were marching toward them.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Germany was being invaded
by Poland, so they said.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Then the transmission went
dead for a little while,

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:90%
all very dramatic.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.020 align:middle line:84%
When it came back, Polish
voices got on the air,

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:84%
calling for all
Poles in the area

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:84%
to take up arms
and attack Germany.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.170 align:middle line:90%
More silence.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.910 align:middle line:84%
A few minutes later,
listeners heard the report

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.312 align:middle line:84%
that German police opened
fire on the Polish terrorists.

00:22:42.312 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, just like during
the Reichstag fire

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:84%
from six years earlier,
Hitler was immediately

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:90%
ready to pounce.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:84%
In his speech to
the Reichstag, he

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.080 align:middle line:84%
used this pretext of
Polish aggression,

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
along with the border incidents
from a few days earlier

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.900 align:middle line:84%
to justify what he
called a defensive action

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:90%
against Poland.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: When Hitler
lashed out at Poland in 1939,

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:84%
the German people followed
him into war without regrets.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
This was the day
Germany had been

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:90%
building for and waiting for.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.299 align:middle line:84%
And with larceny
in their hearts,

00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:84%
they gloried in the destruction
they were letting loose

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.472 align:middle line:90%
upon the world.

00:23:16.472 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: By then, the
German tanks were already

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:90%
rolling into Poland.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, radio stations
across much of Europe,

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:84%
including the BBC,
picked up this story

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and at least initially, treated
it like a legitimate piece,

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
that is, that Poland
had attacked Germany.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.130 align:middle line:90%
That didn't last long though.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The day after the
Gleiwitz incident,

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.940 align:middle line:84%
there were American
correspondents

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:84%
who were brought to the
scene but no neutral parties

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.340 align:middle line:84%
were allowed to
investigate in detail.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
As a result, journalists
from other countries

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
soon became skeptical of the
German version of the incident,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.200 align:middle line:84%
and soon, many people
and governments

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:84%
began to disbelieve
the story altogether.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The governments of
Britain and France

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.230 align:middle line:90%
didn't seem to believe it.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.300 align:middle line:84%
They declared war
against Germany two days

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.252 align:middle line:90%
after the invasion.

00:23:59.252 --> 00:24:01.543 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Prime Minister
Chamberlain of Great Britain

00:24:01.543 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
gave the Nazi dictator a zero
hour for withdrawing his troops

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:90%
from Poland.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But in reality,
the international community

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
wasn't really the target
of the false flag,

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:90%
the German public was.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.330 align:middle line:84%
The fake Polish attack
served as a pretext,

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and it worked well
enough for its purpose,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's really
all Hitler wanted.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.780 align:middle line:84%
The German people,
even under Hitler,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
had a hard time imagining that
their own government would

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:84%
stoop to something
so devious and to lie

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
so blatantly to them.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:43.690 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing about false
flags, most people are good.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't think in
terms of such deviousness

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and treachery.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank goodness, right?

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
But that innate goodness
often blinds people

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
to the deceptions
foisted against them

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:84%
by unscrupulous
people, who happen

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:84%
to control the
means of propaganda

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and all the other powerful
institutions of a society.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:84%
The theory of the
big lie does work.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:84%
You tell people
something long enough

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and with enough conviction,
most folks will just go along.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it has to be
right, we think.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
When we look at the elements
to study in false flags,

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:84%
we see that both the Reichstag
fire and the invasion of Poland

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.030 align:middle line:84%
fit the model with
virtual perfection.

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Both were spectacular events
that received instant media

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:90%
saturation.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Both cases were quickly
closed, officially,

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that is, with
convenient scapegoats

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:90%
to blame for both of them.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
In both cases,
there was decisive

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and immediate government
action taken as a response

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.945 align:middle line:84%
to these alleged acts of
terrorism and aggression.

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And both cases had
significant anomalies

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that deviated from the
officially sanctioned

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:84%
narrative, and both
clearly benefited

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:90%
one and only one group--

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.940 align:middle line:90%
the Nazi party and hierarchy.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NARRATOR: Only by such a
war and quick annihilation can

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
these fascist nations, whose
cash and resources are small,

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:90%
hope to conquer.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: On top
of that, when you

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.860 align:middle line:84%
look at the band of
criminals that made up

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.310 align:middle line:84%
the Nazi party, from the
grass root thugs right up

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:21.030 align:middle line:84%
to the lying, sociopathic
leadership and their known

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:84%
philosophies supporting
the necessity of deceiving

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:84%
the public to
achieve their ends,

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
it's case closed
for both of them.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Hermann Goering may
well have been right

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:84%
when he said the people
can always be brought

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.980 align:middle line:90%
to the bidding of the leaders.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:90%
That is easy.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.760 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is tell
them they're being attacked.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.259 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a good
idea for all of us

00:26:40.259 --> 00:26:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to remember that in
our own day and age.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Join me next time
on False Flags, when

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.110 align:middle line:84%
we look at how the Nazis
were not the only false flag

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:90%
innovators of the 1930s.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese and Soviets
engaged in blatant acts

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of deception and perfidy,
creating deadly false flags

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:58.609 align:middle line:90%
to satisfy their greed.

00:26:58.609 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Remember, reaching the
truth means stripping away

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:90%
the illusions around us.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm Richard Dolan.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:10.656 align:middle line:90%
