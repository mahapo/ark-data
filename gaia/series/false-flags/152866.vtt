00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: Hello.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.125 align:middle line:84%
I'm Richard Dolan and
this is "False Flags."

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:10%
There is arguably no
event of our lifetime that

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.100 align:middle line:10%
has had more impact
on the world around us

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:10%
on the political forces that
predominate in our world

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.220 align:middle line:10%
today than the attacks that
took place on American soil

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360 align:middle line:10%
on September 11, 2001, 9/11.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It's now more than 15 years
ago, but anyone old enough

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.670 align:middle line:84%
to remember that day
will never forget it.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Where they were
when they found out,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that feeling in the
pit of their stomach,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and their knowledge even
on that day that somehow

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
things were going to
change in this world,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and not in a good way.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Well looking back on all that
has transpired since then,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
that feeling of dread
was certainly justified.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.476 align:middle line:84%
9/11 took America
into a dark place.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And America has dragged
the rest of the world

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:90%
along for the ride.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.950 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode,
I discussed some,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
by no means all, of the
most egregious problems,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
anomalies, and frankly
literally unbelievable aspects

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:90%
of the official story.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, any in-depth study
of the events of that day

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.810 align:middle line:84%
bring up one serious problem
or explanation after another.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:10%
We can only conclude that
the official explanation is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:10%
comprised of a tissue of lies.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It's understandably
difficult for people

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
to accept that they've been
lied to on such a magnitude.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Instinctively, we
want to believe

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:90%
our official authorities.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:84%
For today, I want
to tell you why

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
9/11 had to happen, at
least from the point of view

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
of those people who sit at
the top of the human power

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:90%
hierarchy.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Because there are such
people, and they have always

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
had ideas about
the direction they

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:90%
think the world should be going.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
They can't always get everything
they want all the time,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
but I can assure
you they get more

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
of what they want than ordinary
people could ever dream of.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
In our very first
episode, I discussed

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.460 align:middle line:84%
how there have been
many dislocated people

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and how easy it is
to run into people

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:84%
who realize deep
down in their bones

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
that there's something not
right with the world around us.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:84%
How tuning into establishment
news for information

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
only makes it worse,
only confuses us more.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.550 align:middle line:84%
How that sense of hopelessness
and confusion is by design.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is simple.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
We're living on a planet that is
being systematically plundered

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and stolen from beneath us,
everything worth owning,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
from the water to the GMO
foods to the pharmaceuticals

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:84%
to the minerals in the
ground to the public services

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
and the entire public
infrastructure.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:84%
This, unfortunately, is how
globalization is happening.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
a war, my friends.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a transnational corporate
financial theft of everything.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But this is a war run by
necessity, by deception.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.530 align:middle line:84%
That is, those
waging it against you

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.170 align:middle line:90%
and me don't want us to know.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
I've gone into this
previously, but now

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:84%
let's get into the
specifics of globalization

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:84%
and help us to understand
things a little better.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
With globalization, you
get economic disruption

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:90%
and the loss of jobs.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
This is Seattle in 1999.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
I think Seattle is
a great indicator.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
These are the World Trade
Organization protests

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.300 align:middle line:90%
from November 30.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:84%
They went on for four
days into early December.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You see, the WTO was convening
in Seattle at that time.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.900 align:middle line:84%
The WTO is one of
the prime engines

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
for global
neoliberalism, that is

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
the ultra corporate friendly
legal structure being

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
put into place since
the end of the Cold War.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:10%
>> The SMEs are responsible for
the largest share of employment

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:10%
opportunities.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:10%
In most economies over
90% in some countries.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: One of the
results of neoliberal policy

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
is the loss of ability
of ordinary people

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
to control their world
around them, simply

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
because transnational
trade agreements prevent

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:84%
local groups or even nations
from legislating laws that

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.260 align:middle line:84%
protect their resources
or labor rights.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
For the WTO meeting
in 1999, protesters

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.280 align:middle line:84%
planned their strategy out
several months in advance.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And when that
convention happened,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
these protesters, at minimum
40,000, probably much more,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:90%
shut that city down.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.554 align:middle line:90%
They just shut it down.

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
They were so effective
the delegates could not

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
enter the premises
for much of the time.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Police tear gas did not work.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Pepper spray didn't work.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:84%
The police were overwhelmed
by an incredibly powerful

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:90%
public reaction.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happens when
the public feels empowered.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
This is when people
were saying no, we're

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.100 align:middle line:90%
not going to put up with it.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Of course, a year and a
half later we have 9/11.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:10%
After 9/11 with the passage
of the USA Patriot Act

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:10%
effectively taking away
massive amounts of privacy

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.980 align:middle line:10%
in one swoop and all the
subsequent laws passed

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.290 align:middle line:10%
via the annual National
Defense Authorization Acts,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:10%
the prevalence of
security cameras now

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:10%
at street corners
throughout the country,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:10%
the reality of police voice
and facial recognition profiles

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:10%
on the population making
sure that you will never

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:10%
be anonymous again.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.920 align:middle line:84%
The reality that
there is nowhere

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:90%
left for anyone to hide anymore.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.695 align:middle line:84%
So ever since 9/11, people
learned to duck their heads

00:05:16.695 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and not speak up because
well, bad idea now.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, 27% of the US
population is 21 years of age

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
or younger, more than a
quarter of the population.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:84%
These are people who grew up
not knowing anything other

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.524 align:middle line:90%
than post 9/11 America.

00:05:32.524 --> 00:05:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It either happened
before they were born

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.930 align:middle line:84%
or when they were too
young to experience

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:90%
much awareness before it.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.850 align:middle line:84%
The idea of rule by the
people, the idea of privacy,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
we have an entire new
generation who are growing up

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:90%
without any of that.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:90%
It's all gone.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So in the midst of massive
deindustrialization and loss

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
of hope, an empowered
population was definitely

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
considered a bad idea, and
an important motivation

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:84%
to create a crisis big
enough to gain control

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:90%
over the situation.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:10%
>> The National Security Agency
authorization to eavesdrop

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.914 align:middle line:10%
on Americans to hunt down
terrorists and encouraged

00:06:08.914 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:10%
support for the Patriot Act.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:10%
He spoke for just
under 10 minutes.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:10%
>>GEORGE W. BUSH: This is
a highly classified program

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:10%
that is crucial to
our national security.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.900 align:middle line:10%
Its purpose is to detect and
prevent terrorist attacks

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:10%
against the United States,
our friends, and allies.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now the other
major geopolitical thing

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:84%
behind false flags I
would suggest to you

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:90%
is the petrodollar system.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people hear about this
thing called the petrodollar,

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:90%
but what is it really?

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to the year 1944.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Back then there was a war
going on, the Second World War.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that
seemed very clear

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:84%
was that the US and its
allies were going to win.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:10%
So the Allied nations met
at a place in New Hampshire

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.340 align:middle line:10%
called Bretton Woods.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
There they laid
out the future of

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:90%
the post-world financial order.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Until that point, the reserve
currency of the world,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
that is the national
currency against which

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
all other currencies
were measured,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:84%
think of it as the universal
language of economics,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:90%
had been the British pound.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:84%
But Britain took two major
hits in a row, the First

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:90%
and Second World Wars.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And the economic
powerhouse of the world

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:90%
was now the United States.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The US dollar was
backed by gold.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere in the world you
could sell your dollars

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and receive gold for
it at $35 an ounce.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Agreeing on the dollar as
the world's reserve currency

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:84%
was good for the world,
since it provided

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:84%
a strong economic foundation
for recovery following the war.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was great for
the United States.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that meant
not only did the US

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
export all of its manufactured
goods out throughout the world

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and make an enormous
amount of money,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.770 align:middle line:84%
but the US was the only
nation in the world that

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:90%
was exporting its money.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Everyone wanted dollars.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.930 align:middle line:84%
What that meant was that when
expensive wars came along,

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
think like the Vietnam
War and all the money that

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
went into the social
programs during the 1960s,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
President Lyndon
Johnson had a choice.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:90%
He could raise taxes.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, he might think
maybe a bad idea

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
since that would be
unpopular for sure.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, he could not
spend the money.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Hey, there's a thought,
not have the Vietnam War.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But survey says no,
the war was happening.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Third option, just
print the money

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.700 align:middle line:90%
and don't worry about inflation.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Because the rest of the world
needs dollars and they'll

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:90%
just deal with it.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
option taken for sure.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And it worked, sort
of, but sort of not.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the 1960s, there
was a run on the US dollar.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:84%
People and nations were
trading it in for gold,

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
getting a great deal
at $35 an ounce.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Soon, America's supply of gold,
which had once been dominant,

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:90%
was frittering away fast.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Enter President Richard Nixon.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
In 1971, he looked
at the problem.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:90%
He saw a couple of options.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Option number one, stop the
expensive war in Vietnam.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
But no, that was
still going to happen.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Option number two, a painful
bout of raising taxes.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can
imagine that outcome.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Then there was
option number three,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:84%
detach the dollar from
the gold standard.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Let it be traded like any
other free floating currency.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Nixon said he was doing this
temporarily, by which he really

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:90%
meant permanently.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:90%
So that solved the gold problem.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
But now there were
all these dollars

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
floating around the world and
no intrinsic reason for nations

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:90%
to keep them.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Soon, they would all end
up in the United States

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%
and end with what?

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Massive inflation.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:90%
Enter Henry Kissinger.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Here's a picture
of Henry Kissinger

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and the King of
Saudi Arabia in 1973.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:84%
The point of this meeting was
to keep the dollar in place

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:90%
as the world reserve currency.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And now they wanted to hook
the dollar to petroleum.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And really what Kissinger was
able to get for an agreement

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:84%
was to have all the OPEC nations
sell their oil only in dollars.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is the foundation of
American policy to this day.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
All the nations would get
their oil pegged in dollars.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
It's great for the US because
it maintains a global demand

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
for US currency, which allows
for all kinds of things

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
that the US can do that no
other nation can think of.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.420 align:middle line:84%
It also holds the world
hostage as a result.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But no other nation could
afford to do what the US does,

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
like prosecute all of its
wars and the like because

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:90%
of the petrodollar system.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
It is a foundation
of America's empire.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:10%
It's really never
discussed, never,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:10%
ever discussed in
mainstream media,

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:10%
but the petrodollar system
is both the foundation

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:10%
and the driving force of
nearly everything America

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.494 align:middle line:10%
does in the world.

00:10:33.494 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARD NIXON: The strength
of a nation's currency

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:10%
is based on the strength
of that nation's economy.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:10%
And the American economy is by
far the strongest in the world.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.460 align:middle line:10%
Accordingly, I have directed
the Secretary of the Treasury

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:10%
to take the action necessary
to defend the dollar

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:10%
against the speculators.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:10%
I have directed Secretary
Connally to suspend temporarily

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:10%
the convertibility of the dollar
into gold or other reserve

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:10%
assets except in amounts
and conditions determined

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:10%
to be in the interest
of monetary stability

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.134 align:middle line:10%
and in the best interest
of the United States.

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now we get
to Saddam Hussein,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:90%
another trigger to 9/11.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
The petrodollar system
is why the United States

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:84%
will demonize anyone not fully
on board with that system.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.430 align:middle line:84%
In the year 2000 for
the first time ever,

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:84%
a major threat came to
the petrodollar system.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.120 align:middle line:84%
A fellow by the name of Saddam
Hussein, the leader of Iraq,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:84%
one of the world's
leading oil producers,

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.855 align:middle line:84%
announced that he would now
be selling his oil in euros.

00:11:35.855 --> 00:11:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this might have set
off alarm bells in Washington?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, yes it did.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
You see, the petrodollar
system not only

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:84%
forces the United States
to physically control

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
the sources of
energy that exists,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
basically the
hydrocarbons that go

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.400 align:middle line:84%
from West Africa across the
continent to the Middle East

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:90%
into Western Asia.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
That's 2/3 of the world's oil
and natural gas right there.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:90%
And the US wants it all.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
They want to control
it physically.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
But the petrodollar
system means that the US

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
has to be the
policeman of the world.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Not to ensure world
peace or some such,

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.860 align:middle line:84%
but to ensure,
among other things,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
that the oil producing
nations of the world

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:90%
sell their oil in dollars.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Saddam's decision, I
am suggesting to you,

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.790 align:middle line:90%
was a key motivator for 9/11.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it was a nice score to
steal roughly $30 trillion

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
worth of oil on the ground in
Iraq, which they did and then

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
sold off to
multinationals, and then

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:84%
to steal all the
great mineral wealth

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.680 align:middle line:84%
under the ground in Afghanistan
as a nice little bonus.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So theft of course, is
always important to this.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And then to control
the population.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:10%
But one of the very
first decisions

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.250 align:middle line:10%
taken by the US-installed
government in Iraq

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:10%
after the invasion of 2003
was to put that country back

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:10%
on the petrodollar system.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest too that the
petrodollar and all of this

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
is part of the hierarchical
based and scarcity driven

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:90%
That is energy scarcity.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Energy in our world
today is based

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
on physical control over a
particular commodity, oil

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:90%
and natural gas, mainly.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you control
those locations,

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:90%
you control the distribution.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:90%
You have power.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.201 align:middle line:84%
That's a strength and
power of the system,

00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a
weakness of the system.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Because if we ever develop an
alternative energy paradigm,

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:84%
this whole system is
very much in danger.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's a good thing.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So this whole system is
vulnerable to emerging

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.020 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And that means that the
false flag phenomenon itself

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.324 align:middle line:84%
might be vulnerable to some
extent because of that.

00:13:33.324 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's one thing to
talk about generalities.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Control the public
domestically, control the oil

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:90%
internationally.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
But let's get into
some specifics.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.060 align:middle line:84%
In the aftermath of 9/11,
several major transformative

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:84%
laws were passed
forever altering

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:84%
the nature of American political
life, and indeed certain core

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
freedoms and privacies
that Americans

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
had fought for and accepted
as their birthright.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.120 align:middle line:10%
The two most important
of these laws

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:10%
were the USA Patriot Act and
the Homeland Security Act.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
There is no way to get around
the fact these laws were

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:90%
and remain extreme.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
They mark a decisive,
and this must

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:90%
be said, dark turning point.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Not only in the history of the
United States, but the world.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.080 align:middle line:10%
As the world's most
powerful nation,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:10%
what happens in
the United States

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:10%
has implications everywhere.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
The USA Patriot Act was rushed
through a panicked Congress

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
in the immediate
aftermath of 9/11.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Overnight, it vastly expanded
the government's authority

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:90%
to spy on its own citizens.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, reducing
checks and balances

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:84%
on those powers like
judicial oversight.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:84%
You might consider
it a bit galling,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
considering that if
you are an American

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.060 align:middle line:84%
you're paying for
this police state.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
It's noteworthy, by the way,
that the US government never

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
said that the 9/11
attacks happened

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't surveilling
the population enough.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, much of the
Patriot Act had nothing

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:90%
to do with fighting terrorism.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So now US intelligence
agents could

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
conduct a secret search of
an American citizen's home

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:90%
without probable cause.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And they could use
any evidence found

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
there to declare him
an enemy combatant,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.210 align:middle line:84%
imprison him without trial, and
deny him the right to confront

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:90%
witnesses against him.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Under the Patriot
Act, the courts

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:84%
have no chance to
review these decisions.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, they might never
even find out about them.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:21.470 align:middle line:84%
The 2001 USA Patriot Act
also allowed the government

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to monitor religious and
political institutions

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
without suspecting criminal
activity all in order

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to assist terror
investigations, however

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:90%
loosely "terror" is defined.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:84%
That was once called
freedom of association.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Now it's under
government surveillance.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The Patriot Act also undermined
attorney client privilege.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:84%
It allowed the government
to monitor federal prison

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.630 align:middle line:84%
jailhouse conversations
between attorneys and clients

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and deny lawyers to US
citizens accused of crimes.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:84%
The other major legislation
to occur after 9/11

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:90%
took place a year later.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:84%
This was the Homeland
Security Act, which

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:90%
went into law in November 2002.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
It created the United States
Department of Homeland Security

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and the new cabinet level
position of Secretary

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:90%
of Homeland Security.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It is the largest federal
government reorganization

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
since the National
Security Act of 1947.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BARACK OBAMA: To
disrupt terrorist attacks,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.410 align:middle line:84%
to make our borders more secure,
respond to natural disasters,

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and make our immigration
system more effective and fair.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Addressing any one of these
challenges is a tall order.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.776 align:middle line:84%
Addressing all of them at
once is a monumental task.

00:16:33.776 --> 00:16:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
the dedicated men

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
and women of the Department of
Homeland Security do every day.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:49.784 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.784 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: The Department
of Homeland Security

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:84%
really goes hand-in-hand
with the USA Patriot Act.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.820 align:middle line:84%
That act created the new
national security state,

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.010 align:middle line:84%
and DHS is one of
the main government

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.410 align:middle line:90%
bodies that enforce it.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It's important to know that
these laws, this revolution

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
in American politics
hinged on 9/11.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:84%
Without 9/11, these laws could
not ever have been justified.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:10%
And how do we know this?

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Because both of these creations
had long since been planned,

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:90%
the timing was just never right.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.520 align:middle line:84%
First regarding
the Patriot Act we

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:84%
have the statement of former
counter-terrorism czar Richard

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Clarke who told Stanford
Law professor Lawrence

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Lessig quote, "I remember
someone asking a Justice

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Department official how did they
write such a large statute so

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:90%
quickly?

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.974 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
answer was that it

00:17:36.974 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:84%
had been sitting in the
drawers of the Justice

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Department for the
last 20 years waiting

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
for the event where they
would pull it out," end quote.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.512 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:17:46.512 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But here's something
just as interesting.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm guessing you
probably don't know this.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
The core of the
USA Patriot Act was

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
in fact written in 1995 by
none other than Senator Joe

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Biden, the man who became
Barack Obama's vice president.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.450 align:middle line:84%
This was reported
in 2008 on CNET.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:10%
You might find it interesting,
by the way, that he did this

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:10%
a few months before the Oklahoma
City bombing took place.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Joe Biden introduced a
bill called the Omnibus

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Counterterrorism Act of 1995.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
It called for secret evidence
to be used in prosecutions.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:84%
It wanted to expand wiretap
and surveillance laws.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.720 align:middle line:10%
To create a new
federal crime called

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.000 align:middle line:10%
"terrorism" that
could be invoked

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.980 align:middle line:10%
based on political beliefs.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
It wanted to allow the United
States military to be used

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:90%
in civilian law enforcement.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And it allowed permanent
detention of non-US citizens

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:90%
without judicial review.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Just come take them away.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And Biden, by the way,
seemed quite proud

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
that his 1995 bill was so close
to the Patriot Act of 2001.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:84%
This is what he said,
quote, "I draft a terrorism

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
bill after the
Oklahoma City bombing

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
and the bill Attorney
General John Ashcroft sent up

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:90%
was my bill."

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1995, most
people were horrified

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:84%
by what Biden proposed
and his bill went nowhere.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.552 align:middle line:84%
All that was needed
was a trigger.

00:19:09.552 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:84%
The Department of
Homeland Security

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:84%
too had been something
that certain people

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:90%
had been hankering for.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Well before September 11,
2001 a government commission

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:84%
called the Hart-Rudman
Commission created

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
under President Clinton in 1998
created the blueprint for what

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:84%
became the Homeland
Security Act,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and published it
in a report called

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.460 align:middle line:84%
"The Road Map for National
Security, Imperative

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.100 align:middle line:90%
for Change."

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:84%
It called for the creation
of a new independent quote,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:84%
"National Homeland Security
Agency," end quote, which

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:84%
would integrate various US
government agencies, including

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
FEMA, the Coast Guard, the
Customs Service, and the border

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.999 align:middle line:90%
patrol.

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what we got.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>> In a single year, the Coast
Guard and Border Protection

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:84%
intercepted an astonishing
$10 billion worth of drugs

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.757 align:middle line:90%
on the way to America.

00:20:02.757 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the most
sophisticated tunnel that has

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.889 align:middle line:84%
ever been discovered
along the border.

00:20:16.889 --> 00:20:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now let's take a
look at the people involved

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:90%
in pushing all this through.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1990s, there was
a group of ideologues and power

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:90%
politicians.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The members of
this group in 1997

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
created The Project for the
New American Century or PNAC.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:90%
They were all about one thing.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:84%
In their words,
they were dedicated

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:84%
to the proposition that
quote, "American leadership

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.902 align:middle line:84%
is good for America
and the world."

00:20:41.902 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:84%
They didn't believe in the
idea of America consulting

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.530 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of the world
about this planetary takeover.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
PNAC immediately got on
President Clinton's case

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.680 align:middle line:84%
about their concern that
Saddam Hussein was not

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:90%
being fully contained.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.090 align:middle line:84%
They recommended a strategy
to protect the United States,

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:84%
as they put it, from the threat
of weapons of mass destruction,

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and put in place policies that
would take down Saddam Hussein.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Forget international
law, who needs that.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So yes, their first
order of business

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.431 align:middle line:84%
was to call for the toppling
of a sovereign government.

00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:16.930 align:middle line:10%
Of course, they knew that to
undertake such radical measures

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.590 align:middle line:10%
abroad they needed
radical measures at home.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:84%
The kind that were
encapsulated in what

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:84%
would become the USA Patriot Act
and the Homeland Security Act.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that
something dramatic

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle line:84%
would have to happen in order
to allow their radical program

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.330 align:middle line:90%
to become a reality.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Just before the election
that put their man George W.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:10%
Bush into the White House,
they stated in September 2000

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.090 align:middle line:10%
that quote, "The process
of transformation,

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:10%
even if it brings
revolutionary change,

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.840 align:middle line:10%
is likely to be a
long one absent,

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.670 align:middle line:10%
some catastrophic and catalyzing
event like a new Pearl Harbor."

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
In other words, only
something truly catastrophic

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:84%
would allow them to implement
their dream of regime

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:90%
change and domestic revolution.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:84%
When George W. Bush won
the presidential election,

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.130 align:middle line:84%
PNAC and its army of neo-cons
got high level government

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:90%
positions.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.740 align:middle line:90%
They were running the nation.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Invading Iraq was a
foregone conclusion.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Now they needed the pretext.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.134 align:middle line:84%
On September 11, 2001
they got that and more.

00:22:20.134 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:10%
>> When the building did
collapse or whatever it was

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.925 align:middle line:10%
that happened, it
was a huge explosion,

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:29.215 align:middle line:10%
a huge rumbling cloud of smoke
and fire came across Church

00:22:29.215 --> 00:22:30.015 align:middle line:10%
Street.

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:10%
>>PAUL LEMOS: About 20
stories below, at least

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:10%
that's what it looked like
to me about 75 flights up

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.640 align:middle line:10%
below the fire I saw from the
corner boom, boom, boom, boom,

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.345 align:middle line:10%
boom, boom, just like twenty
straight hits just went down.

00:22:43.345 --> 00:22:47.594 align:middle line:84%
And then I just saw the whole--
the whole building just went.

00:22:47.594 --> 00:22:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And as the bombs were going,
people started running.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.794 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there and watched
a few of them explode.

00:22:52.794 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I just turned
around and I just

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:55.626 align:middle line:90%
started running for my life.

00:22:55.626 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Because at that point,
the World Trade Center

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.570 align:middle line:90%
was coming right down.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
From the corner, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.145 align:middle line:90%
The whole building just went.

00:23:04.145 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And as the bombs were going,
people just started running.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there and watched
a few of them explode.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.042 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Did they
make it happen?

00:23:12.042 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll leave
you with the words

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.620 align:middle line:84%
of Aaron Russo, a filmmaker
who, to his own surprise,

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
became friends with Nicholas
Rockefeller, a lawyer

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and member of the Council
on Foreign Relations.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Russo gave an interview shortly
before he died of cancer.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.530 align:middle line:10%
>>AARON RUSSO: And we've never
learned the truth about 9/11.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:10%
The whole agenda is
to create a one world

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:10%
government where everybody has
an RFID chip implanted in them.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.447 align:middle line:10%
All money is to
be in those chips.

00:23:39.447 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:10%
And this is given to me
straight from Rockefeller.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.770 align:middle line:10%
This is what they
want to accomplish.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Russo said that Nick
Rockefeller told him in October

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
2000, that is before the
election that put Bush

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
into the White
House, that quote,

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:middle line:84%
"There was going
to be an event."

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:84%
He never told me what
it was going to be,

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:58.470 align:middle line:84%
but there was going
to be an event.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And out of that event, we were
going to invade Afghanistan.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.640 align:middle line:84%
We were going to invade Iraq
to take over the oil fields

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
and establish a base
in the Middle East

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and make it all part
of the New World Order.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, later
on 9/11 it happened.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered how
he was telling me

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:84%
there was going to be
this war on terror,

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:90%
which is no real enemy.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
is a giant hoax,

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
but it's a way
for the government

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
to take over the
American people.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Here's the deal, we
look at these matters

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.560 align:middle line:84%
because they have
shaped our world.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:84%
To this day, the official
establishment media

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:84%
pretends one thing
while the truth is

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:90%
something entirely different.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.810 align:middle line:10%
Much of the entire national
security apparatus, and indeed

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.740 align:middle line:10%
of the entire world
for the past 15 years

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:10%
now has been created on the
basis of 9/11, an event itself

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:10%
that is not what it has been
portrayed to us officially.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, the evidence
shows us that the story

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.260 align:middle line:84%
we have been given is a lie,
one that brave researchers have

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:90%
been exposing for some time now.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we live
in an era of false flags.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:90%
That's just how it is right now.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But the best way for us
to deal with that reality

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize it and not to
give it power over ourselves,

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.250 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have to be
taken in by the illusions.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if we seek
transformation,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.554 align:middle line:84%
we need truth as our
constant companion.

00:25:19.554 --> 00:25:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Join me next time
on "False Flags"

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:84%
when we explore the great lie,
weapons of mass destruction

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:90%
and the invasion of Iraq.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to forget just how
many false flags were employed

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
in galvanizing the public
to invade a country that

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.830 align:middle line:90%
had nothing to do with 9/11.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm Richard Dolan,
until next time.
