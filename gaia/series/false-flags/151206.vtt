>> RICHARD DOLAN: I'm Richard
Dolan, and this is False Flags.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:16.680 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:10%
During the 1950s and '60s,
there was a worldwide movement

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:10%
of people in countries
that had recently

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.810 align:middle line:10%
been colonies of Europe
throughout Africa, Asia,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:10%
and much of the Middle East,
as well as other small nations

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:10%
in the Western hemisphere
that for all intents

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.870 align:middle line:10%
and purposes were colonies
of the United States.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
In all these places, people
had the same basic issue--

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
inequality, poverty,
and the need

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:84%
for serious social
reforms, land reform

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:90%
probably being at the top.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:84%
If America were an openly
expansionist nation

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
like Germany or Japan
of the Second World War,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
the charade might not have
needed to be so elaborate.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Sure, Germany and Japan both
did international false flags,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
but those were incredibly
crude compared with the levels

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:90%
achieved by the United States.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Simply put, America's rhetoric
and posturing about freedom

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:84%
forced Americans to
become far, far better

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.070 align:middle line:90%
at the art of the false flag.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:84%
A perfect example of this
is what is known today

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:90%
as the color revolution.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.990 align:middle line:84%
After the end of
the Cold War, there

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
were a series of
what appeared to be

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:84%
mostly peaceful democratic
uprisings in Eastern Europe,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:84%
in what was formerly
part of the Soviet Union.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:84%
In 2003, the nation
of Georgia had what

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:90%
was called the Rose Revolution.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
In 2004, Ukraine had the
Orange Revolution, and so on.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.270 align:middle line:84%
These became called
color revolutions.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Was it coincidence that
all of these revolutions

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
ended up with the
new governments

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:84%
being closer to the United
States, Europe and the IMF

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.110 align:middle line:90%
and less friendly toward Russia?

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the United States
had mastered this art form

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:84%
back in the 1950s, long before
anyone came up with the term.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
This form of regime
change, one that

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.920 align:middle line:84%
wears the trappings
of popular revolt,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
often works better
than military coups

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
because they seem like genuine
expressions of the people.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
It's fair to call
color revolution

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
a form of false
flag, and we really

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
ought to take a
closer look at them.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
fundamentals of how

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:84%
to create your own
revolution in another country

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
or in your own country,
for that matter.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Step one-- start
with lots of money.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It all goes toward
funding your core leaders

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:90%
to build the organization.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
We're talking many millions
of dollars, and maybe billions

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
if the need is strong enough
and the target is worth it.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Step two-- your
core leaders hire

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.020 align:middle line:84%
the key workers and
trainers, the foot soldiers

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:90%
of the movement.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Step three-- create social
media and news infrastructure.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Any modern movement has to have
sophisticated social media.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.480 align:middle line:84%
We're talking Facebook pages,
Twitter feeds, Instagram,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:90%
and of course, a good website.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Step four-- create
physical infrastructure.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
office space, tents

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
if you want shantytowns
or long-term protest

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
sites, wooden platforms
and structures

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
for speeches, signs, banners,
lots and lots of signage.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Step five-- create an event, the
event that sparks the movement.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Only when the
infrastructure is ready

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:90%
do you then need the event.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the rallying point
around which your movement

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:90%
can generate interest.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
It could be an election that
you choose to contest or someone

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
in prison that you
can politicize.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
It could be corruption
of the government.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
It could be ethnic or
class or racial oppression.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, it has to make
sense within your society.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Step six-- include the public.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Once you have
created your event,

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
now you use your foot soldiers
and get the public involved.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Once they see that there's
an actual political movement

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and that it appears to
be a natural response

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to some injustice,
you'll probably

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
get some public attendance
at your rallies.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the
make-or-break moment,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.870 align:middle line:84%
since the movement has to appear
to have broad public support,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
or it won't succeed.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Step seven-- provoke
a police response.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.540 align:middle line:84%
This is dangerous, but
obviously can be effective.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It will help to polarize
your society, which

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:90%
ultimately helps your cause.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
Provoking police response
will require very selective

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:90%
video recording and editing.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Then you display
it on social media.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
This means demonstrating
police violence in some form,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.800 align:middle line:90%
but it's all in the editing.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Post your clip to
prove to the world

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
how repressive
the government is.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Step eight-- once
you have what appears

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
to be a genuine movement,
you can now enlist support

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:90%
from local politicians.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Once that happens,
you have sanction,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
as it were, from at least
some of the official power

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.230 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Step nine-- get the
attention of Western media.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:84%
If the funding
behind this movement

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:84%
is the CIA or powerful groups
with the right connections,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
then this step has
already been prepared,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
but now is the time
for coverage to begin.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And that leads to step 10--

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:90%
enlisting international support.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
When the US officially
condemns the repressive actions

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:84%
of the government in
question and supports

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
your popular uprising, you
know you're on your way.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
If all goes well,
condemnations can

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
lead to sanctions which
increases social misery

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:90%
and only helps your cause.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And that, my friends,
is how you can

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.960 align:middle line:90%
destabilize an entire society.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:84%
What we will see today are
several examples of this way

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:90%
back in the 1950s.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll start with the
nation of Iran in 1953.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:84%
To this day, America's
operation there

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is a classic example of false
flag and regime change success.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, let's not
leave out the British,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
because this was definitely
a joint operation.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at Operation Ajax.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:10%
Throughout the first
half of the 20th century,

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:10%
Iran with its massive oil fields
was under British domination,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:10%
its oil under the
profitable control

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.010 align:middle line:10%
of a British
corporation known rather

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:10%
dishonestly as the
Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:10%
But make no mistake,
this operation

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.390 align:middle line:10%
was British all the
way and had been

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:10%
controlling the Iranian
oil industry since 1913.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Today, by the way, that company
is known as British Petroleum.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
In 1951, a politician
named Mohammad Mosaddegh

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:90%
became Prime Minister of Iran.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Mosaddegh was a remarkable
man and a true progressive.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, his government
introduced reforms

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:84%
like social security and
much needed land reforms.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
All these made him very
popular with the people.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:90%
But then he did the unthinkable.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle line:90%
He challenged the oil industry.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Initially, he tried to audit
the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and earn a 50/50 cut from
the company's profits.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
When he received no cooperation,
the Iranian parliament

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:84%
voted to nationalize
Iran's oil industry.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
REPORTER: Mosaddegh
wanted none of it.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:84%
As the crisis worsened and
anti-British feeling mounted,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Iranian army units were
deployed to maintain order.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.275 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:84%
As the Iranian authorities
moved to take over oil plants

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and docks and the British
technicians unanimously

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.365 align:middle line:84%
refused to accept employment
with the new regime,

00:07:10.365 --> 00:07:11.985 align:middle line:90%
the situation seemed hopeless.

00:07:11.985 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Well, this was
popular with the people,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:90%
With the US and UK, not so much.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:10%
This kicked off a
regime change operation

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:10%
greenlit by Winston Churchill
in the UK and Dwight Eisenhower

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.000 align:middle line:10%
in the US, run by the
CIA and known as Ajax.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It resulted in a coup against
the Iranian government in 1953.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
The CIA official in charge
of orchestrating events

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
was Kermit Roosevelt, grandson
of former President Teddy

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Roosevelt.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Operation Ajax involved
several things.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:84%
One was detonating
a series of bombs

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
by the agents posing as
members of the Communist Party.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
These were actually
Iranian agents

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:84%
working for US and
British intelligence.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
kill innocent people

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
by planting explosives
and then blaming

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
the communists and also
groups loyal to the Mosaddegh

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know the CIA was behind
this since they've admitted it.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
What we don't know is
the extent of this tactic

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.780 align:middle line:84%
since the CIA
destroyed nearly all

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:84%
of its files
relating to the coup.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
We do know that at least one
well-known Muslim's house

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.072 align:middle line:84%
was bombed by CIA agents
posing as communists.

00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:90%
That much has been confirmed.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And we also know that some
of the most feared gangsters

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
in Tehran were hired by the
CIA to stage pro-Shah riots

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:90%
on the day of the coup.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
The CIA brought in other paid
demonstrators by the bus load

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and took over the
streets of the city.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Up to 300 people may
have been killed because

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.370 align:middle line:90%
of the conflict that day.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Another tactic was
bribing demonstrators

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.810 align:middle line:84%
into chanting
pro-Mosaddegh slogans

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:84%
while violently
attacking symbols

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
of the Shah, who was
essentially the king of Iran

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:middle line:90%
and supported by the US.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And this would be
like paying people

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to burn the American flag
in order to discredit

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:90%
an organization or movement.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:10%
In this case, the point
was to turn public opinion

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:10%
against Mosaddegh
and for the Shah.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:90%
It worked.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few very
unsavory characters

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:90%
were brought in for this coup.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:10%
One was general
Fazlollah Zahedi,

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.090 align:middle line:10%
who had been imprisoned
by the British

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:10%
during the Second World
War for trying to establish

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:10%
a pro-Nazi government in Iran.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:84%
This man was made the
new prime minister

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.010 align:middle line:84%
on the day of the coup, and
he received a $5 million

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:90%
payment the very next day.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And then a month later,
he received $28 million.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Then, after the Iran government
signed a friendly oil deal,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
he received yet
another $40 million,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:90%
for a total of $73 million.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
That's equivalent to
$657 million today.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Another key person in the
coup was Bahram Shahrohk,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
who literally had been
trained by the Nazi minister

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:90%
of propaganda, Joseph Goebbels.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, he became
Iran's director of propaganda.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Another pro-Nazi,
Sharif-Emami, took

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
several prominent
government positions,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
including that of
prime minister twice.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
The Western news media, led
by the BBC and New York Times,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
praised this new
Iranian government.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And of course, no one
gave the slightest hint

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:84%
that this was a
covert operation.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Why would they?

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Were deeply in bed with
both CIA and MI6 themselves,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.890 align:middle line:84%
except that ordinary
people had no idea.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:84%
The Ajax operation
was wildly successful.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:10%
It deposed a popular government
working on behalf of the people

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.650 align:middle line:10%
to salvage the oil
companies that were

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:10%
the real owners of the country.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:84%
A big part of the price
the US got out of it

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
was a major piece of
the Iranian oil action.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So the Brits no
longer had a monopoly.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:10%
And the Iranian
people, well, they

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:10%
got 26 years of the Shah,
who remained a loyal client

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:10%
of the United States and of
David Rockefeller for the rest

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:10%
of his days, becoming especially
known for his opulent lifestyle

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:10%
and repressive political police.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.610 align:middle line:84%
The operation taught
the United States

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that it could fake a popular
uprising as long as they

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.220 align:middle line:84%
threw enough money around,
hired enough thugs to break

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
things and kill people,
and had a compliant

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.255 align:middle line:90%
media to watch its back.

00:11:10.255 --> 00:11:14.930 align:middle line:84%
The US outdid itself the
following year in 1954.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.690 align:middle line:84%
This was a false
flag regime change

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
operation against the
nation of Guatemala.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Guatemala, one of the
poorest nations in the world,

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:84%
had been controlled by
US corporations in power

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:90%
seemingly forever.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The best land was owned by the
American corporation United

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:90%
Fruit.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:90%
The people lived in poverty.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
In 1944, there was
a popular revolution

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:84%
against the dictator,
which led to Guatemala's

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:84%
first democratic election
and major social reforms

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
like minimum wage, better
education, improved labor laws,

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.170 align:middle line:90%
and expanded voting rights.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
In 1950, President
Jacobo Arbenz began

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:84%
pressing for land
reform, probably

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
the most important issue
in Guatemala at that time.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The main idea was
to give poor farmers

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
access to the vast, unused
lands owned by United Fruit.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine how popular
this would be in such a country.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
In America, President
Harry Truman

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.170 align:middle line:84%
authorized a coup
against Arbenz in 1952,

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
but it was aborted when
details leaked out.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:10%
Then in 1953, Dwight
Eisenhower became President,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.820 align:middle line:10%
bringing into his cabinet
the Dulles brothers, John

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:10%
and Allen.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.660 align:middle line:84%
One ran the State
Department, one ran CIA,

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and both were heavily
connected to United Fruit.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Eisenhower authorized the
CIA to carry out a coup

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:90%
operation against Guatemala.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
The CIA decided
they needed to show

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that Arbenz's
government was communist

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.200 align:middle line:90%
and under Soviet control.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:84%
First, in February
1954, the CIA planted

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
weapons in next-door
Nicaragua that

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to
link to the Soviets

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and prove that Guatemala was
under control from Moscow.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.660 align:middle line:10%
The president of Nicaragua,
Anastasio Somoza Garcia,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:10%
was in on the fix,
and told the press

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:10%
that a Soviet submarine
had been photographed,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:10%
although no images
were available.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Somoza also floated a story
about Guatemalan assassination

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
squads that no one
seemed to believe.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
The CIA also gathered a large
amount of Soviet-marked weapons

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
to plant them inside
Guatemala before the invasion.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.170 align:middle line:84%
The whole point, of course, was
to prove Russian intervention.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:84%
The CIA also bribed
certain members

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Guatemalan officer corps
to get them to join the rebels.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
They set up radio
stations inside Guatemala

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and posed as rebels trying to
get recruits for the movement.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:10%
One lie that they
told on the radio

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:10%
was that Arbenz was secretly
planning to disband or disarm

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:10%
the armed forces and replace
it with a people's militia.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:10%
CIA planes dropped
leaflets over Guatemala

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:10%
carrying the same message.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
The CIA even offered
Arbenz himself

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.060 align:middle line:84%
a bribe, possibly to
abdicate or something less.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.209 align:middle line:90%
We're not sure.

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:84%
They dumped a lot of money for
him into a Swiss bank account,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.040 align:middle line:90%
but he rejected it.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:84%
An office called the US
Information Agency, essentially

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
a CIA outfit, started
placing unattributed articles

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
in foreign newspapers labeling
certain Guatemalan officials

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:10.584 align:middle line:90%
as communists.

00:14:10.584 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
They referred to
different actions

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
by the Guatemalan government
as communist-inspired.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
In just a few weeks before
the coup of June 1954,

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.470 align:middle line:84%
more than 200 articles
about Guatemala

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
were written and published
across Latin America.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
This became a standard
American practice--

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:84%
publish a story abroad and watch
it spread around the world.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.310 align:middle line:84%
All this gave the appearance
that independent world opinion

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:84%
was taking a certain stand, and
it kept America's connection

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:90%
hidden.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.457 align:middle line:10%

professed to be patriots.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They may not themselves
have been communists,

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.570 align:middle line:84%
but they had been subjected
to the inflammatory influence

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:12.860 align:middle line:84%

of its tools.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Shortly
before the coup,

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Nicaraguan president Somoza
got back into the picture

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and announced that his police
had discovered a secret Soviet

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:90%
shipment of weapons.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, these had
been planted by the CIA.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And finally, just
before the invasion,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:84%
an unmarked plane parachuted
weapons with Soviet markings

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:90%
into Guatemala.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REPORTER: Guatemala City,
representatives of the new

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:84%
anti-communist government,
inspect $10 million worth

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
of arms that were sold to
the deposed red government

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:90%
of President Arbenz.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Manufactured in Czechoslovakia,
and delivered by Polish ships,

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:84%
the collection was
supposed to help

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
the commies to
suppress the rebellion

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.589 align:middle line:90%
against their tyranny.

00:15:52.589 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: When, by the way,
some of the CIA's operation was

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
exposed in late January 1954,
the State Department simply

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
called the accusations
ridiculous and untrue.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The US press was
completely on board.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:10%
Time Magazine ridiculed
the idea that Americans

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:10%
would engage in a coup and said
the accusations were, quote,

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:10%
"masterminded in Moscow."

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:10%
The coup itself was
almost a denouement.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.230 align:middle line:10%
The CIA armed and
trained a force

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:10%
of 480 men, not large at all.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
They invaded Guatemala from
bases in Honduras and El

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:90%
Salvador on June 18, 1954.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
psychological warfare

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that did the trick, including
setting up an anti-Arbenz radio

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.650 align:middle line:84%
station claiming to be
giving genuine news.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of the CIA broadcasts
were transmitted

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:84%
over regular public radio, and
some over military channels,

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:90%
all very convincing.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
During one nighttime raid, a
tape recording of a bomb attack

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.900 align:middle line:84%
was actually played
over loudspeakers

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:84%
set up on the roof
of the US embassy

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.410 align:middle line:90%
just to scare the people.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
When Arbenz went on the air
to try and calm everyone down,

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:90%
the CIA jammed his broadcast.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.028 align:middle line:84%
There were also
dummy parachute drops

00:17:02.028 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:84%
to make people think it
was a major invasion that

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:90%
was going on.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.240 align:middle line:84%
United Fruit circulated
photographs of what they said

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:84%
were mutilated bodies
about to be buried

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:84%
in a mass grave, examples,
they said, of the atrocities

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.640 align:middle line:90%
committed by the Arbenz regime.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.270 align:middle line:84%
The Guatemalan military realized
that this was a US operation,

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and for that reason,
it seems, refused

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to fight out of terror that
the US would actually invade.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Arbenz resigned a week
later, and the CIA

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.960 align:middle line:90%
set up the new government.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.245 align:middle line:84%
>> MAN: This is the first time
in the history of the world

00:17:33.245 --> 00:17:35.785 align:middle line:84%
that the communist government
has been overthrown

00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:90%
by the people.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we
congratulate you

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and the people of Guatemala for
the support they have given.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: The US media was
utterly servile in reporting

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:84%
things just as the US
government wanted them to.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, the United States
truly dealt the death blow

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.645 align:middle line:90%
to Guatemalan democracy.

00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Through the rest of the
century, that country

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:84%
was beset by dictatorship,
civil war, and human rights

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:90%
violations.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.657 align:middle line:84%
But American
corporations were happy.

00:18:02.657 --> 00:18:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REPORTER: Well, the facts
show that the rebellion now

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:84%
disturbing Central America
is one conducted by patriotic

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
anti-red Guatemalans, which
inspires Russia to air

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:84%
the worn-out charge that
the US created the trouble.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: The operations in
Iran and Guatemala emboldened

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
America's CIA into thinking it
had carte blanche with the less

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:90%
powerful nations in the world.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Regime change became
a point of pride

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.950 align:middle line:84%
within people in the CIA's
clandestine operations.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.515 align:middle line:90%
And then came Cuba.

00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:36.446 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:36.446 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REPORTER: From his stronghold
in the wild Sierra Madre

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Mountains, Cuba's Fidel Castro
emerged triumphant after two

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:84%
years of guerrilla warfare
against the Batista regime.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: Cuba had always
been a loyal economic appendage

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:84%
of the United States, as well as
home to organized crime money,

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
some of which happened
to be close to the CIA.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:10%
At the beginning of 1959,
a revolutionary movement

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:10%
led by Fidel Castro did the
unthinkable and took power.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
In March 1960,
President Eisenhower

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
allocated $13 million for the
CIA to plan Castro's overthrow.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:10%
A few months later in
early January 1961,

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:10%
not long before he left the
White House to John F. Kennedy,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.520 align:middle line:10%
Eisenhower told the
head of the Joint Chiefs

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:10%
of Staff, Lyman Lemnitzer, that
he would move against Castro

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:10%
before the inauguration if
only the Cubans gave him

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:10%
a really good excuse.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Then, Ike put out an idea.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:84%
If Castro didn't give a
good excuse, maybe they--

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:90%
and this is a quote--

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:84%
"could think of
manufacturing something that

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.720 align:middle line:90%
would be generally acceptable."

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.980 align:middle line:90%
End quote.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're talking
about a false flag.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:84%
It could be a bombing,
some sort of attack

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
carried out by the United States
against the United States,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.550 align:middle line:90%
blamed on the Cubans.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the CIA had been
organizing a secret operation

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
in Guatemala with the help
of some Cuban exiles known

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:90%
as Brigade 2506.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:03.960 align:middle line:84%
The CIA was still
under the direction

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
of Allen Dulles, who had pulled
off the Iranian and Guatemalan

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:90%
operations so successfully.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
The man who oversaw
what would become

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
known as the Bay
of Pigs Invasion

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:90%
was the CIA's Richard Bissell.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.360 align:middle line:10%
Many of the agents Bissell
used for the Cuban operation

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.345 align:middle line:10%
had worked for the
1954 Guatemalan coup.

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing to keep in mind
about the Bay of Pigs Invasion

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:84%
was that the world
was not supposed

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.190 align:middle line:90%
to know the US was behind it.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
As incredible as
that sounds, that's

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:90%
how it was supposed to go down.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing was
supposed to appear

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:84%
to the world to be a
Cuban operation entirely.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy in particular
felt very strongly

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
that the US needed deniability
of the whole action.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
After all, we're talking
about a fairly open invasion

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
of a sovereign country, even
if it was one they didn't like.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:84%
That meant any airpower had
to seem as though it came

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:90%
from the Cubans themselves.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.570 align:middle line:84%
So a day and a half before
the actual invasion,

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:04.790 align:middle line:84%
on April 15, 1961, three
groups of B26 bombers

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
bombed three Cuban airfields
near Havana and Santiago.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:10%
They were painted to look
like stolen Cuban planes,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.540 align:middle line:10%
and their goal was to
destroy most or all

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:10%
of the armed aircraft
of the Cuban Air Force

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:10%
in preparation for
the main invasion.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
However, it turned out
that Castro and his people

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:84%
knew about the raid and
had moved his planes out

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:90%
of harm's way.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy realized things
were not looking good,

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:90%
but it was too late to stop.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:84%
On April 17, the
Cuban exile brigade

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
began its invasion
at an isolated spot

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
on Cuba's southern shore
known as the Bay of Pigs.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Right away, the
invasion was a disaster.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Unexpected coral
reefs, paratroopers

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.870 align:middle line:84%
landing in the wrong places,
and even a Cuban radio station

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:84%
on the beach
broadcasting every detail

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:90%
to listeners across Cuba.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Castro's troops soon
pinned down the invaders,

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:90%
and they quickly surrendered.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.910 align:middle line:10%
Kennedy, the
brand-new President,

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:10%
had egg all over his face.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But this did not
stop the attempt

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:84%
to create false flags and
regime change against Cuba.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Most famously, there
was Operation Mongoose

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:84%
led by US Air Force
General Edward Lansdale.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
This included a
wide-ranging plan

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:84%
from spreading
propaganda inside Cuba

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to enlisting resistance
forces to disrupting

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.400 align:middle line:84%
the Cuban government
and economy,

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:84%
destroying sugar crops,
railways, bridges,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
oil refinery, and mining
harbors using US special forces.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Mongoose didn't last long.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy pulled the plug in 1962.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.300 align:middle line:84%
The most shocking false flag
planned during this period

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
thankfully was
never implemented.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:90%
This was Operation Northwoods.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember when Eisenhower had
been pining for a manufactured

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:90%
excuse to invade Cuba?

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea
stayed in the head

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
of the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, General Lyman

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Lemnitzer.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Lemnitzer decided
that the US would

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:84%
have to trick the American
public and the world

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
into hating Cuba so much
that they would sign

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:90%
on to a war against Castro.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Operation Northwoods was
actually a series of ideas,

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:84%
none of which came to
fruition, but all of which

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.020 align:middle line:84%
required false flags to
justify a war with Cuba.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most
outrageous of them

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:84%
considered the
launch of John Glenn,

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
who was the first American
to orbit the Earth.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
On February 20, 1962,
Glenn was to lift off

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.910 align:middle line:84%
from Cape Canaveral, Florida
on his historic journey.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Lemnitzer and his
Chiefs actually

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:10%
proposed to Lansdale that if the
rocket were to explode and kill

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.650 align:middle line:10%
Glenn, they would provide,
quote, "irrevocable proof

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:10%
that the communists
and Cubans did it."

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:10%
They would do this--
and this is a quote--

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:10%
"by manufacturing various
pieces of evidence

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:10%
which would prove electronic
interference on the part

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.150 align:middle line:10%
of the Cubans," end quote.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So just consider--
just as NASA prepared

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:84%
to send the first
American into space,

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:84%
the Joint Chiefs of
Staff were preparing

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.410 align:middle line:84%
to use John Glenn's death
as a pretext to begin a war.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, fortunately,
that did not happen.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So Lemnitzer and the Chiefs
developed other ideas.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
One was a series of incidents to
take place at the US Navy base

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.330 align:middle line:84%
at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, such as dressing

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
friendly Cubans in
Cuban military uniforms

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and then have them start riots
near the main gate of the base.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Others would pretend to be
saboteurs inside the base.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Ammunition would be
blown up, fires started,

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.540 align:middle line:84%
aircraft sabotaged, mortars
fired at the base with damage

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.965 align:middle line:90%
to installations.

00:24:33.965 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And if this reminds you a bit
of the German invasion of Poland

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:90%
from 1935, then you're learning.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Another of Lemnitzer's
ideas called

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:84%
for blowing up a US
ship in Guantanamo Bay

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and blaming Cuba.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.500 align:middle line:84%
That one sounds, of course,
like the USS Maine of 1898.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Other ideas included developing
a Cuban terror campaign

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.910 align:middle line:84%
in Miami or in Washington,
sinking a boatload of Cubans

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
en route to Florida,
whether real or simulated,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
kill or wound Cuban refugees
in the United States,

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.505 align:middle line:84%
and of course giving
them wide publicity.

00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of these were to
be blamed on Castro's Cuba.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:14.480 align:middle line:84%
Lemnitzer also proposed
bombings and hijackings

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that would implicate
the Cuban government.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most outrageous
of these involved making it

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:84%
seem that a Cuban aircraft
had attacked and shot

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:90%
down a chartered civil airliner.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Another was to make it appear
that the Cubans had shot down

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:84%
an American fighter jet
over international waters

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:90%
in an unprovoked attack.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.840 align:middle line:84%
All of this was
proposed in March 1962.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I think Kennedy was
astounded by all of this.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:10%
He simply told Lemnitzer there
was virtually no possibility

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:10%
that the US would ever use
overt military force in Cuba.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.970 align:middle line:84%
The whole plan was shelved
and remained secret

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.855 align:middle line:90%
for the next 40 years.

00:25:50.855 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
All notes were thought
to be destroyed,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.260 align:middle line:84%
but apparently, this body
wasn't fully buried after all.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Operation Northwoods
was finally revealed

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:84%
to the public in a 2003 book by
researcher and historian James

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Bamford.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
President Kennedy
was assassinated

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in November 1963, an event that
rightfully should be considered

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:84%
a false flag much like Stalin's
assassination of Sergey Kirov

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.990 align:middle line:90%
three decades earlier.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.690 align:middle line:84%
In any case, less than
a year after that,

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:84%
one of the most critical false
flags of the 20th century

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.720 align:middle line:84%
took place at a place
called the Gulf of Tonkin

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.480 align:middle line:90%
on August 2, 1964.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Johnson was now
America's President.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Hostilities had been going on in
Vietnam since the Second World

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.620 align:middle line:84%
War, and all through the 1950s
and '60s, the US had been

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:84%
managing things from
behind the curtain--

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
preventing Vietnam
from becoming unified,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:84%
arming and controlling the
government in South Vietnam,

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.020 align:middle line:84%
a government that was so
unpopular that Buddhist monks

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
began lighting themselves
on fire in protest.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But Johnson didn't want
to tone things down.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to ratchet
them up and escalate

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.324 align:middle line:90%
an already unpopular war.

00:26:57.324 --> 00:26:58.990 align:middle line:84%
It could help make
money for his friends

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:00.800 align:middle line:90%
who owned defense corporations.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
He could also get the
Pentagon and CIA off his back

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and quit trying to invade Cuba,
which was no longer feasible.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But he needed a provocation to
convince the American people

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.940 align:middle line:84%
that the war had
to be escalated.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And then on August
2, a sea battle

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
occurred between the United
States and North Vietnam

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:90%
in Vietnamese waters.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:90%
This was the Gulf of Tonkin.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Both sides experienced
damage to their vessels,

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:84%
and the North
Vietnamese lost four men

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.340 align:middle line:90%
and suffered six casualties.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, the
National Security Agency

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:84%
claimed that a similar
battle had taken place.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.560 align:middle line:84%
What actually happened
is that the USS Maddox

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.930 align:middle line:84%
was engaged in
electronic espionage

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
against North Vietnam,
coordinating attacks

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.230 align:middle line:84%
by South Vietnam and
the Laotian Air Force

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:84%
against North
Vietnamese targets.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.480 align:middle line:84%
They were doing this in North
Vietnamese waters, which

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.190 align:middle line:90%
is an act of war.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.170 align:middle line:84%
On August 2, the
North Vietnamese,

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.020 align:middle line:84%
knowing this was going
on, attacked the Maddox,

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.630 align:middle line:84%
rather ineffectively,
as you might imagine.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
There was never any
evidence of a second attack.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But on August 5,
newspapers across America

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.390 align:middle line:84%
reported this as a
series of attacks

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.950 align:middle line:90%
against American vessels.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:84%
People were told that
North Vietnamese torpedo

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.860 align:middle line:84%
boats launched an unprovoked
attack while the Maddox was

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.080 align:middle line:90%
on a routine patrol.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REPORTER: Swift and sure
has been US retaliation

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:84%
for communist PT boat
attacks on the high seas.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the Maddox, one
of the two destroyers

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that were attacked while
patrolling international waters

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.370 align:middle line:84%
in the Gulf of Tonkin
near North Vietnam.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.615 align:middle line:84%
War planes from two
carriers, the Ticonderoga

00:28:35.615 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:84%
and the Constellation, avenged
the unwarranted red assault

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:42.884 align:middle line:84%
with 64 sorties to
North Vietnam PT basins.

00:28:42.884 --> 00:28:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: President Johnson
added the attacks were

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:84%
on the high seas, which
meant international waters,

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.490 align:middle line:90%
but this was not true.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Johnson also knew the second
attack never happened.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Captain John J. Herrick,
the task force commander

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Gulf, had
cabled Washington

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.370 align:middle line:84%
that the second report was the
result of an overeager sonar

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:84%
man who had picked up the sounds
of his own ship and panicked.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.420 align:middle line:84%
The US media relied
almost exclusively

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:84%
on US government officials
for its information

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and almost completely
avoided any questioning

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:90%
of what actually happened.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:10%
>> WAYNE MORSE: At the time,
I referred to it as another

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.810 align:middle line:10%
sinking of the Maine.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.400 align:middle line:10%
>> INTERVIEWER: Suggesting?

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:10%
>> MORSE: Well, you know what
the best historical advice is

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.710 align:middle line:10%
in regard to the
sinking of the Maine.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:10%
It was a deliberate act on
the part of the United States

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.190 align:middle line:10%
to have an excuse to go
to war against Spain.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.010 align:middle line:10%
The Gulf of Tonkin was a
deliberate aggressive act

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:10%
on the part of the
Johnson administration

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:10%
to justify making war
against North Vietnam.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: The rest followed
sadly and predictably.

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.410 align:middle line:84%
The US Congress gave permission
for massive air strikes

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
on North Vietnam and a
dramatically ramped-up US

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.020 align:middle line:84%
involvement there up to more
than half a million troops

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.082 align:middle line:10%
>> LYNDON JOHNSON: When
the going got hard,

00:29:58.082 --> 00:30:01.680 align:middle line:10%
when the road got
longer and dustier,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:10%
when the casualties
started coming in, why,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:10%
there's certain folks started
looking for the seller.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.195 align:middle line:10%
I know they-- or a
good many of them have,

00:30:13.195 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:10%
and I don't question
their right to do so.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:10%


00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't even criticize them
for taking that position,

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.801 align:middle line:10%
if that's what their
conscience dictates.

00:30:28.801 --> 00:30:31.300 align:middle line:10%
I just wish their conscience
had been operating when they're

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:10%
making all these
other decisions,

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:41.150 align:middle line:10%
because Congress gave us
this authority in August 1964

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:10%
to do whatever may be necessary.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.670 align:middle line:10%
That's pretty far-reaching.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.520 align:middle line:10%
That's the sky's the limit.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> RICHARD: It wasn't until
2005 that the NSA released

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:84%
declassified documents which
confirmed the second attack had

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:90%
never happened.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:84%
All North Vietnam was
doing on the second night

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:84%
was salvaging two of the boats
damaged on the first night when

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.290 align:middle line:84%
they were simply defending
their territorial waters

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.300 align:middle line:90%
from American military action.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Even though there was a
minor military encounter

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:84%
between two nations, this
remains a genuine false flag.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.510 align:middle line:84%
The US explicitly
misrepresented events

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:84%
that were going on
to such an extent

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.610 align:middle line:84%
that its portrayal of
them amounted to fiction.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:84%
In the first place,
the US had been

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
involved in ongoing provocations
against North Vietnam,

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and these provocations were
military actions that were

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.660 align:middle line:90%
killing people in that country.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Second, US ships were in North
Vietnamese territorial waters,

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:90%
an act of aggression.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Third, the North Vietnamese
defense of its sovereignty

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:84%
was the equivalent
of a tiny peashooter

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.100 align:middle line:84%
against the USS Maddox,
which suffered no casualties.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Fourth, there was
no second attack

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.060 align:middle line:84%
as reported by the US
government and slavishly

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.950 align:middle line:90%
repeated by the media.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.530 align:middle line:84%
The US power structure
provoked the North Vietnamese

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:84%
into doing something,
anything that

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
could be construed as
aggressive and used

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.780 align:middle line:84%
that as their justification
for the war it wanted.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And today, Vietnam is one of
the most servile of all the US

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:90%
client states.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.580 align:middle line:10%
It took the deaths of
perhaps 2 million Vietnamese

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.650 align:middle line:10%
to break the population,
but now there

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.230 align:middle line:10%
is a nation of cheap
labor fully available

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.090 align:middle line:10%
for international
corporate needs.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:20.630 align:middle line:90%
Mission accomplished.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:84%
The events I discussed today
all took place a long time ago,

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.770 align:middle line:84%
but their relevance for
today should be obvious.

00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why it remains
essential for those

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.100 align:middle line:84%
who care about truth and freedom
and dignity that we remember.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.700 align:middle line:84%
The next time you see an example
of a sketchy regime change

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.610 align:middle line:84%
operation around the world,
or the next time a government

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.280 align:middle line:84%
asks you to support an
invasion, no matter what

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.250 align:middle line:84%
the justification,
take a deep breath

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.590 align:middle line:84%
and examine just what
is really going on.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:84%
The more we question official
narratives that are fed to us,

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:90%
the better off we will all be.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Besides, questioning
authority is the foundation

00:32:57.790 --> 00:32:59.890 align:middle line:90%
of any free society.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.385 align:middle line:84%
You know, some
people might think

00:33:01.385 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that all this talk about false
flags and nasty government

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:90%
activities is upsetting.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.987 align:middle line:90%
But what I would say is this--

00:33:06.987 --> 00:33:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the art of personal
development for each one of us

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.370 align:middle line:84%
requires us to shed many
illusions that have surrounded

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:90%
us all our lives.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Illusions are painful to
shed, but once they're gone,

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.000 align:middle line:84%
we enter into a
truly higher reality.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So don't fear the red
pill, because if you

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
seek transformation,
you need truth

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:90%
as your constant companion.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm Richard Dolan.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.190 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.
