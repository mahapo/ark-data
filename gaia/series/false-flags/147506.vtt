>> Hello, I'm Richard Dolan,
and this is False Flags.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.550 align:middle line:10%
The First World War
broke the old world

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:10%
and created something
entirely new,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.160 align:middle line:10%
it brutalized and militarized
the world as well.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And it also created the
first truly modern system

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:90%
of propaganda.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Newspapers had been
nationalistic and warlike

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:84%
before this, but
now, increasingly,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
the methods of
manipulation were becoming

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:90%
more and more sophisticated.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Especially with the
innovations of one man,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.790 align:middle line:84%
a nephew of Sigmund Freud
named Edward Bernays, who

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:84%
revolutionized advertising
and almost single-handedly,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.685 align:middle line:84%
created the new industry
of public relations.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But more than this,
in several nations,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
control over the
newspapers and radio

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.580 align:middle line:84%
was becoming a very important
priority, especially

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
in those nations that had
authoritarian governments,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
like the new Soviet Union, the
fascist government in Italy,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.560 align:middle line:84%
and later, Germany, as well
as in the empire of Japan.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
these governments

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.530 align:middle line:84%
were diving headfirst into
a new and strange world

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
where their governments
had control over mass media

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, could dominate
the public mind as never

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And on top of this, many
of those same nations--

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Germany, Japan, and
the Soviet Union--

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
were very unhappy with
the state of the world

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
after World War I and
their place in it.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The world opinion did not
allow for wars of aggression

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
like it might have
done in the past.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
War was widely condemned now
as it had never been before.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So if a nation wanted
to create change

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
on the international stage,
they would need a good pretext.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
All the pieces were in place
for some major false flags,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
especially once the global
economy collapsed after 1929.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
In our last episode, we saw
how this transpired in Germany

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.700 align:middle line:84%
when the Nazi party
took power and conducted

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:84%
two epic false flags
that changed the world.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a look at
Japan and the Soviet Union,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
two other authoritarian
governments

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:84%
that engaged in false
flags during the 1930s.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:90%

>> Nearer still to US territory
is Japan's greatest enemy.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:10%
Only 54 miles of Bering
Strait separate Alaska

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:10%
from militarized Soviet Russia.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Because these two nations
also consciously created false

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.150 align:middle line:84%
narratives to justify actions
that could never have otherwise

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.680 align:middle line:90%
been justified.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Then before we go,
we'll also take a look

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
at an event in
American history that

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
has been at the center of
debate for quite some time now,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.130 align:middle line:84%
the bombing of Pearl
Harbor in 1941.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Was that also a false flag?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, Japan had a long history
of government censorship

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:90%
and thought control.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
In the centuries before it
had any contact with the West,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Japan, in many ways, was a
police state with total control

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:90%
over the spread of information.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.800 align:middle line:84%
A tendency which the state
entrenched even further

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century
once the nation

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
was in contact with
the rest of the world.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:84%
After the First World War
ended, thought crimes,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
like socialism or promoting
Korean independence,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:90%
were severely punished.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
There was even a special police
force created specifically

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:90%
to deal with such offenses.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
The media was
tightly controlled.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.220 align:middle line:90%
Censorship was universal.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And by the mid-1930s, an
information and propaganda

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.321 align:middle line:90%
committee was formalized.

00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But even before
this, the government

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
had detailed guidelines
to publishers

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:90%
that had to be followed.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, criticism of
the government or military

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.710 align:middle line:90%
was forbidden.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And, indeed, anything deemed
unfavorable was censored.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:90%

like the Nazis over in Germany,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:84%
could tell its citizens
whatever it wanted.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Japan's military
was also feeling

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.140 align:middle line:90%
pretty good about itself.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:84%
The country had
significantly modernized,

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.900 align:middle line:84%
much more than China which was
their neighboring giant next

door.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, China was
still a long way

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
from getting its act
together in any way that

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:84%
could compete with the rest
of the world economically

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:90%
and militarily.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese leadership
saw a ripe opportunity.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Japan already had economic
interests in China,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%

control outright.

A group of Japanese
officers in Manchuria

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:84%
wanted to provide a

justify Japanese
military invasion

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.510 align:middle line:84%

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
was owned by Japan, and
was only 800 meters away

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.720 align:middle line:90%
from a Chinese garrison.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The plan was to create
a large explosion which

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:84%
would then attract
Chinese troops

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:90%

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:84%
It goes on-- "a clash between
Japanese and Chinese troops

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:90%
then took place.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds and thousands
of Japanese residents

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:90%
were placed in jeopardy.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
In order to forestall
an imminent disaster,

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese army
had to act swiftly.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:84%
The endeavors of
the Japanese Army

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
to guard the South Manchurian
Railway against wanton attacks

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
should be viewed
in no other light.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:84%
It may be superfluous to repeat
that the Japanese government

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
harbors no territorial
designs on Manchuria."

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So note the threadbare
excuse and the emphasis

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
on oh, no, we don't
want anyone's territory,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:84%
while, of course, they
were stealing it all.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:84%
You see, even back in the
1930s with false flags,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't so much the
actual event that mattered,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
but how it was portrayed
in the major media.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Clashes between Japanese and
Chinese in Manchuria prompted

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:84%
the Nepalese militarists
to take action.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Without waiting for any
formal declaration of war,

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.389 align:middle line:90%
Japanese troops attacked.

00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The rest of the
world severely condemned

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Japan's invasion, but Japan
knew that no one was ever going

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle line:90%
to do anything about it.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Europe and America
were still reeling

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
from the bloodbath of
the First World War,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:84%
they did not want to
go through war again.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And plus, there was
a global depression

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.510 align:middle line:90%
that made things worse.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:84%
The mood of that era was
focused on making war illegal

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and, basically, talking it out
through the League of Nations.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was useless
against a government committed

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.740 align:middle line:90%
to actual conquest.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:84%
On September 18th,
1931, Japanese troops

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.030 align:middle line:84%
seized Mukden, Manchuria's
most important city.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>> They say nothing
succeeds like success.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Japan did it once,
why not do it again?

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:84%
They did it, in 1937, once
again, against hapless China.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.620 align:middle line:84%
This time, the Japanese
wanted to invade China itself.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
We now come to the infamous
Marco Polo Bridge Incident.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> First thing the Japs did was
to prepare their usually fake

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:90%
alibi.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
This time it wasn't a
damaged railway track

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.210 align:middle line:84%
as it had been in
Manchuria 1931.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:90%
A Jap soldier had disappeared.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, he'd been kidnapped
by the insolent Chinese.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.092 align:middle line:84%
Once more, Japan's
honor had been insulted.

00:09:54.092 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Once more, the insult
must be avenged.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>> This isn't as clear
and obvious a false flag

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
as the Manchurian Incident,
but it is suspicious,

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and it was used by Japanese
War Hawks as the pretext

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:90%
for invading China.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
On the night of July 7th,
1937, the Japanese and Chinese

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
were very close to each
other near the northern city

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.484 align:middle line:90%
of Beijing.

00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
They were not at war,
but they were definitely

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:90%
not on friendly terms.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.080 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese military unit
was engaging in a drill

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
at that time and
decided, they did not

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:84%
need to inform the
Chinese of that fact.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So not surprisingly, some
shots were fired by both sides.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:84%
This does not appear to
have been a huge encounter

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and it certainly did not need to
become anything more than that,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.530 align:middle line:84%
but then, a Japanese
soldier went missing,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:90%
or so we are told.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.510 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese decided to turn
this into an alleged kidnapping

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:90%
by the Chinese.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese decided to
make this into a big deal.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
They demanded to search the
Chinese base for their missing

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:90%
soldier.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese said, no, thanks.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
We'll search for him ourselves
and you can bring one

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:90%
of your officers along to help.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but if the
Japanese had agreed

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to that logical
suggestion, they would have

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:90%
had no excuse to pick a fight.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So instead, they tried
forcing their way in

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:90%
and were driven back.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Now things escalated and this
became a full on skirmish.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>> On the night
of July 7th, 1937,

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.535 align:middle line:84%
at the Marco Polo
Bridge near Peking,

00:11:19.535 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
the Jap war machine struck.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Japan clearly wanted a reason
to go to war, and they went.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was a false flag,
a set up by the Japanese.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.120 align:middle line:84%
If not, then it was one of
the most threadbare excuses

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:90%
for war in the last century.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It opened the way for
massive atrocities

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:84%
against the Chinese people
and years of conflict

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that went well past
the Second World War.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, again, these events
were able to happen in some part

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
because there was simply no
real freedom of the press.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.796 align:middle line:84%
No real freedom of
inquiry and expression.

00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe in the case of
Japan, it wouldn't

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.330 align:middle line:84%
have made much difference
because of all the false flags

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.320 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:90%

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> These two by Japan were
among the most obvious.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Really, the Japanese military
didn't care all that much.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, they were all
about controlling the media

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
within their country
and, therefore,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
controlling the
narrative because once

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:84%
you do that, you can
do almost anything.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Japan, like Nazi
Germany, was a pioneer

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
in the modern art
of the false flag.

hoards gained new victories

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and occupied new territory,
Japan's men of the sword see

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:84%
already at hand,
the hour of destiny.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:84%
The hour when Japan's new order
can be imposed upon the world.

nation in the 1930s that helped

to develop this modern plague.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.420 align:middle line:84%
well, the assassination of
Stalin's leading rival in 1934,

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:84%
had at least equal impact on
the history of the Soviet Union.

>> In the summer of 1932,
Soviet dictator, Joseph Stalin,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.180 align:middle line:84%
started to realize that there
was a great deal of opposition

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.700 align:middle line:84%
to his policies,
which had, after all,

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:84%
not only been heavy handed, it
not only dispossessed millions

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:84%
of people from their
farms and property,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
but had also alienated the
Revolutionary Party that

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.440 align:middle line:84%
brought them all to
power, the old Bolsheviks.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Stalin had eliminated
and banished many of them

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:90%
in various power struggles.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Now he was finding that some
party members were publicly

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:84%
criticizing him and calling
for the readmission of some

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
of them, like Leon
Trotsky, back to the party.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.150 align:middle line:84%
At a top level meeting,
Stalin demanded

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that his critics should
be arrested and executed.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:84%
But there was one man brave
enough to argue against him.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:90%
And that was Sergey Kirov.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.985 align:middle line:84%
At the vote, the
majority supported Kirov.

00:14:04.985 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Kirov was a unique man.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:84%
He was an original revolutionary
from way back in 1917.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was still
very loyal to Stalin.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Even so, he had an
independent mind,

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.550 align:middle line:84%
and he was incredibly
popular, much

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:84%
more liked by the
Communist Party leadership

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.170 align:middle line:84%
than Stalin was,
that's for sure.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
In 1934, at another
top government meeting,

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Kirov suggested a national
policy of reconciliation.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
He said that people
who had been imprisoned

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
for opposing the collective
farms and the industrialization

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:90%
policies should be released.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And, once again, Stalin
found himself out voted.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Stalin planned
Kirov's assassination.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Since Kirov was in Leningrad,
which is now St. Petersburg,

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to have it
done through the head

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
of the intelligence
agencies in that city.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.060 align:middle line:84%
The problem was, that man was
a close friend of Kirov's.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
When Stalin tried to
have one of his lackeys

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
to replace Kirov's man,
Kirov was so annoyed,

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
to say the least, and
said absolutely no way.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:10%
Stalin then had to go
through his security

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:10%
chief, the monstrous Genrikh
Yagoda, to find an assassin.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:84%
That man was found, a man
named Leonid Nikolaev.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Nikolaev's first attempt
to enter Kirov's building

totally failed, he only
ended up getting arrested.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But he had friends on the
inside and was released.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Then on December 1st, 1934,
he finally got in and killed

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:90%
his target, Kirov was dead.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.990 align:middle line:10%
Nikolaev and all the other
key witnesses were eliminated.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Stalin was able to turn Kirov
practically into a Saint.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:84%
The media, completely and
totally compliant to Stalin,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:84%
whipped up public
frenzy into a witch hunt

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.780 align:middle line:84%
for the terrorists who
plotted this heinous crime.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Before long,
Stalin's other rivals

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:90%
were charged with the murder.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:90%
They were interrogated.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:90%
They were tortured.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And then brought before a
secret military tribunal.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
With no proof against
them, they accepted

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
what was called quote,
the political and moral

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
responsibility, end quote,
for Kirov's murder, whatever

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:90%
that means.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
This was the beginning
of the great purges,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
a brutal and extra
repressive period

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Stalinist nightmare.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It lasted for years, right up
to the outbreak of the Second

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:90%
World War.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:29.200 align:middle line:84%
You might not think of a
political assassination

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.040 align:middle line:84%
as a false flag and most of
them aren't, but think about it.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Stalin eliminates his most
dangerous political rival

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and blames it on his
other political rivals,

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
using this as a pretext for
turning the country inside out.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.650 align:middle line:90%
It qualifies.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Now Stalin, like Hitler,
like the Japanese,

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:84%
was also not averse to doing
an international false flag

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
as a way to justify an
invasion of another country.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:84%
After the German invasion
of Poland of 1939,

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:84%
involving several false
flags as we have seen,

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:84%
the Soviet Union also
created a false flag

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:90%
to invade the nation of Finland.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Those two countries
had signed treaties

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:84%
promising that neither country
would invade the other.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So that meant if the Soviets
were going to invade Finland,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
they needed to invent
a very good excuse.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
that in the year

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
or so before they
did their false flag,

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
they held several war games
based exactly on the incident

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:90%
that they now enacted.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:10%
>> On November 26, 1939,
at the small border village

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:10%
of Mainila, seven
artillery shots were fired.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Finnish observation
posts saw this.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
There were witnesses who
saw the shells detonate just

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:90%
inside Soviet territory.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
The Soviets claimed that several
of their soldiers were killed.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.690 align:middle line:90%
They were outraged.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Not surprisingly, the Finns
denied any responsibility.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
By saying what they did,
they were essentially

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
accusing the Soviets of
perpetrating the false flag,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:84%
although they didn't
state this explicitly,

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:90%
at least, not at first.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Finland wanted to have a neutral
investigation of all of this,

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.980 align:middle line:84%
but predictably, the
Soviet Union refused.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:84%
The Finns did their
own investigation,

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
concluding that they had
nothing to do with this.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, not only did they
identify Soviet artillery

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:84%
as the source of the shelling,
but their own artillery

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.180 align:middle line:84%
was out of range,
explicitly in order

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.030 align:middle line:90%
to prevent just such a scenario.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.650 align:middle line:90%
But it didn't matter.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
A few days later,
the Soviets invaded

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Finland starting what was
called the Winter War,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
a bloody and brutal affair
that took many lives,

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:90%
all based on a lie.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
There's been a great
deal of archival research

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.610 align:middle line:90%
on this incident.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:84%
It has proven beyond any doubt
to have been a false flag.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
This includes
declassified materials

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
in the Russian and
Soviet archives,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Finnish war diaries, and a great
deal of witness testimony taken

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.480 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Even Soviet leader,
Nikita Khrushchev,

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.970 align:middle line:84%
years later admitted that
the whole thing was staged.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.290 align:middle line:10%
In the 1990s, Russian president
Boris Yeltsin also agreed.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:84%
The whole point had been to
paint Finland as an aggressor

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.135 align:middle line:90%
and launch an offensive.

00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, there were no
Soviet troop losses either,

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.400 align:middle line:90%
that was all made up.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
These false flags happened at
a certain period in our world

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.120 align:middle line:84%
when a number of puzzle pieces
making up the modern world

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:90%
came together.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:84%
One simple thing was that
because wars of aggression

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.590 align:middle line:84%
were now considered
wrong and immoral,

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
nations that had
aggressive designs

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.040 align:middle line:84%
had to find better and better
excuses for their invasions.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:84%
This really hadn't been the
case in earlier centuries.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the nations behind
these early false flags--

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Germany, Japan, and
the Soviet Union--

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
were all forms of dictatorship
with dominant control

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:84%
over their media, which,
back in those days,

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:90%
was newspapers and radio.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
When the government
controls the media,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
they control the message
that's reaching the people.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:90%
That is very, very important.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And was also very
much a new development

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Sure, governments
had always had lots

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
of power over people, going
back to ancient times,

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
but what they didn't have a
system of mass media by which

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
to spread their information,
or disinformation,

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.150 align:middle line:90%
as the case was here.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And also, each of
these nations had

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
developed very good
militaries for their time

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:84%
with very well-developed
intelligence communities.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And we can see, the military
and intelligence community

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.330 align:middle line:84%
influence on most of
these false flags.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe more to the point,
each of these nations

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
was a regional power, much more
powerful than their neighbors.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to justify an
international false flag

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
if you are likely to get beaten
by the nation on your border.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Finally, each of
these nations was

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
very unhappy with their place
in the world at the time.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Germany and Japan, especially,
but also, the Soviet Union,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
all were looking for
opportunities to grow.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.854 align:middle line:84%
None were happy with the
international status quo.

00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Well that's an
unhappy combination

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:84%
of events that allowed for
these false flags to take place.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Now before wrapping up,
there is one other event

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:84%
we really need to take
a look at and this

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:84%
is the attack on Pearl
Harbor on December 7, 1941.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:10%
It was this attack on
a major American Naval

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.160 align:middle line:10%
base by the Japanese that
launched America's involvement

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:10%
in the Second World War.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:26.342 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.342 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter what our enemies,
in their desperation may

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
attempt to do to us, we will
say as the people of London have

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:90%
said, we can take it.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:46.155 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, what's
more, we can give it back.

00:21:46.155 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And we will give it back
with compound interests.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
>> For years, this attack was
attributed to a failure of US

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.410 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And even to this day, that
is the dominant mainstream

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:90%
interpretation.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to note
that there were people

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
at the time who had suspicions
that somehow, Pearl Harbor was

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.431 align:middle line:90%
a setup.

00:22:07.431 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:84%
There was no internet
back then and hardly

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.070 align:middle line:84%
anything of what we would
call an alternative media

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:84%
so the suspicions
never went anywhere.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But since then, a number
of revisionist historians

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.680 align:middle line:84%
have challenged the
dominant narrative

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:90%
of what happened that day.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.630 align:middle line:84%
One such study, by historian
Robert B. Stinnett,

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.971 align:middle line:84%

over one million records.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
He finally hit pay
dirt in the 1990s

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:84%
discovering that even
though many files had still

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.330 align:middle line:84%
been held back and
even altered to conceal

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:84%
important information,
enough was

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:84%
released to allow him to put
the story, the true story,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
He made it clear that the
American Military High

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Command knew more
than a week in advance

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Pacific fleet at Pearl
Harbor would be the target.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:84%
This was because American
Naval Intelligence

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:84%
had cracked the Japanese
Naval codes back

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.380 align:middle line:84%
in 1940, more than a year
before the attack that killed

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:90%
over 2,000 American servicemen.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Stinnett showed that the
establishment explanation

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.090 align:middle line:84%
of Pearl Harbor, that
Americans hadn't cracked

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.700 align:middle line:90%
the Japanese encryption.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.070 align:middle line:84%
That the Japanese
engaged in radio silence

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.600 align:middle line:90%
to avoid detection.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
That Americans didn't know
where the Japanese would attack,

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:84%
He showed all of
that to be false.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
For instance, he showed
the Japanese carrier fleet

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.150 align:middle line:84%
did engage in daily radio
communication with itself,

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
as well as other
Japanese command centers.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:10%
He knew this by reading American
Naval Intelligence radio

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:10%
intercepts of the
Japanese transmissions.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.490 align:middle line:10%
The Americans had
the info right there,

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.840 align:middle line:10%
intercepting well over
90% of all Japanese radio

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:10%
transmissions.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:84%
All sent on to the headquarters
for Naval Communications

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence in Washington.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Of course, all these Japanese
communications were in code,

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
but American codebreakers had
broken all the Japanese Naval

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:90%
codes by October of 1940.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:84%
American cryptologists could
read almost all Japanese radio

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:84%
traffic within hours
of receiving them.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Now in a normal world,
you would think, great,

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
America has the ability
to defend itself.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
But the critical information
from these intercepted Japanese

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.750 align:middle line:84%
communications was withheld
from the key commanders

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.170 align:middle line:84%
of the forces in Hawaii and
the Pacific fleet, Lieutenant

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:84%
General Walter Short and
Admiral Husband E Kimmel.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It strongly appears
that these two men

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
were betrayed by their
friends and colleagues

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.990 align:middle line:84%
in the Naval High
Command who did

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.360 align:middle line:90%
know of the impending attack.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Not only could the
Americans intercept and read

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:84%
the Japanese radio
transmissions,

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.470 align:middle line:84%
most of the radio
intercept stations

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:26.520 align:middle line:84%
had technology called radio
direction finders which

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:84%
allowed them to
pinpoint the location

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:90%
of specific Japanese warships.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:84%
All of this, and more, was
uncovered by historian Robert

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Stinnett in his excellent book.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Now the thing about
Pearl Harbor is not

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
that it was a classic false
flag in the sense I've

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
been discussing
earlier, this wasn't

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:90%
an American covert operation.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese clearly
conducted the attack.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:84%
But the US political
and military leadership

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:56.100 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get involved in the
World War that was going on

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:84%
at the time, but American
public opinion was dead set

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.680 align:middle line:90%
against getting involved.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.620 align:middle line:84%
A pretext, or cause,
was absolutely

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
necessary to change that
public opinion, something

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:90%
dreadful and shocking.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>> 7:55 AM December 7th, that
minute will go down in history

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
as the beginning of
the end of the Japs.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I know it because they
started something we're

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.670 align:middle line:90%
going to finish, you and me.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the American
government has never made any

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
such admission, the historical
evidence points strongly

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to the conclusion that President
Roosevelt and his chief

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:84%
advisers knew this attack was
going to happen and allowed it

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
America wasn't a dictatorship
with total control

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:84%
over the press like Germany,
Japan, or the Soviet Union,

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:84%
but as spectacular
as Pearl Harbor was

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the carnage
and destruction,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.410 align:middle line:84%
it was a much more
subtle false flag

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.480 align:middle line:90%
than any other of that era.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Because Pearl Harbor
was allowed to happen

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and clearly, the people involved
were extremely close lipped

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:84%
about it for the
rest of their lives.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
It may be that some people
would look at the situation

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
today and condone the
president's policy.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:84%
After all, they could argue
that getting involved in the war

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
was the right thing
to do and something

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
was necessary to
convince the public.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's so, but in a system
of government based on rule

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.620 align:middle line:84%
by the people, such
underhanded tactics only

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.190 align:middle line:84%
serve to erode the
foundations of that system.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:84%
After all, once you learn how
to manipulate public opinion so

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
easily, it becomes very
tempting to keep on doing it.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, we have to wonder just
how the American public might

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:84%
have responded had it learned
of Stinnett's research

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.750 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:84%
How angry do you think
people would have been?

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:84%
The point of discussing these
perfidious acts of the past

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.140 align:middle line:90%
is twofold.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.699 align:middle line:84%
First, I want to emphasize
to you that false flags, even

00:27:57.699 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:84%
though they may not
be something that

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.870 align:middle line:84%
goes all the way through ancient
times with any regularity,

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:84%
are something that goes back
through the past century.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:10.010 align:middle line:84%
They are part and parcel
of the world we live in.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.170 align:middle line:84%
They may not happen
everyday, but there

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.060 align:middle line:84%
are reasons they have
happened in the past

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and those reasons remain
with us to this day.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.490 align:middle line:84%
The other reason to
talk about these things

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:84%
is not to depress us by
discussing evil things

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.035 align:middle line:84%
that governments
do, on the contrary.

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:24.890 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Truth-telling is the
most empowering act of all.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:84%
It's only by looking
at the world around us

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:84%
with clear vision that we have
a chance to identify problems

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and to deal with them.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.955 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunate that false
flags are part of our world,

00:28:37.955 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:84%
but we don't help ourselves or
anyone else by pretending they

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:90%
aren't.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
We need to see them clearly
and be willing to call them out

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.820 align:middle line:84%
when they happen
because when we do,

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:84%
we empower ourselves
and step-by-step,

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:84%
really do make our
world a better place.

when after the end of
the Second World War,

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:01.250 align:middle line:84%
false flags
increasingly returned

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.170 align:middle line:84%
against the government's
own citizens.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember, reaching the
truth means stripping away

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:90%
the illusions around us.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.800 align:middle line:84%
