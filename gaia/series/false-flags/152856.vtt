>>RICHARD DOLAN: Hello,
I'm Richard Dolan.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And this is False Flags.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:17.720 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:10%
On the morning of
September 11, 2001,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:10%
a series of incredible,
tragic events

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:10%
unfolded before the
eyes of the world

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:10%
as we learn that four
commercial airliners had

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.464 align:middle line:10%
been hijacked by terrorists.

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:31.505 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the morning,
the world had changed.

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:10%
Three of the aircraft had hit
targets, the two largest towers

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.040 align:middle line:10%
of the World Trade
Center in New York City

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:10%
and the Pentagon
in Washington DC.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
The fourth airliner
crashed near the small town

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:90%
of Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We were told it was probably
headed for the White House.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of people
died, the lion's share

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
coming from people who
were in the World Trade

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:90%
Center at the time.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:84%
President George W.
Bush and his team

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:84%
featuring people like Vice
President Dick Cheney,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld, National Security

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Adviser Condoleezza
Rice, and many others

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:84%
told us that America had
been attacked by terrorists.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:10%
>>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
Today, our fellow citizens,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:10%
our way of life,
our very freedom

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:10%
came under attack in a series
of deliberate and deadly

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.760 align:middle line:10%
terrorist acts.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: They immediately
identified Osama bin Laden

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
as the leader of the group known
as al-Qaeda that had planned

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:90%
and organized the attack.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.990 align:middle line:10%
President Bush and his
national security team

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:10%
sprung into action.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.040 align:middle line:10%
Within a month, the US
had invaded the nation

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:10%
of Afghanistan
where we were told

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.720 align:middle line:10%
Osama bin Laden was hiding out.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Within 18 months, the US
had also invaded Iraq,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that the
US government admitted

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.540 align:middle line:84%
that Iraq had nothing
to do with the attack.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:84%
From the beginning,
no one in America

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
was allowed to question the
so-called truths of 9/11.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:10%
President Bush himself
called on the nation

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.839 align:middle line:10%
not to tolerate crazy
conspiracy theories about 9/11.

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PRESIDENT BUSH: Let us never
tolerate outrageous conspiracy

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
theories concerning the
attacks of September the 11th,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
malicious lies that attempt
to shift the blame away

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:84%
from the terrorists themselves,
away from the guilty.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: And, indeed, the
mainstream media obliged him.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Its coverage became
a straight jacket

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:84%
of conformity, a
state of affairs that

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:90%
has lasted to the present day.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Out of 9/11, we ended up
with the USA Patriot Act,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
the Homeland Security Act, and
the never-ending series of laws

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that have eviscerated
our rights as citizens;

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
privacy, gone, the
right to habeas corpus,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.960 align:middle line:84%
gone if the government
labels you a terrorist.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:10%
A culture of conformity has
spread from the mainstream

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:10%
media to the very
fabric of our society,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.860 align:middle line:10%
a rigid ideological mindset
that has replaced the political

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:10%
with the cultural.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:10%
That is don't
question our politics.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Instead, focus on culture,
language, race, and identity.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:90%
Stay divided.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Fight each other.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we will gobble up
your rights while we're at it.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the events
of 9/11 with a clear eye

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.769 align:middle line:84%
since there's a lot
that is wrong with it.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Regarding the north and south
towers of the World Trade

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Center, we were told
immediately and repeatedly

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.200 align:middle line:90%
that they collapsed.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
We were given a full-on
media blitz essentially

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:84%
that the crash of airplanes
and subsequent fires

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.890 align:middle line:84%
caused a total collapse
of the Twin Towers.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:84%
There is an alternative
narrative, actually

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.560 align:middle line:84%
several somewhat competing
alternative narratives.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But all of them effectively
debunked the official narrative

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and state in one form or
another that these structures

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
were brought down
through other means

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
via some type of
controlled demolition,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
whether these be
with highly advanced,

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.280 align:middle line:84%
albeit conventional explosives
like nano-engineered thermite

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:84%
or even a limited
nuclear detonation,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:84%
or then even more exotic
energy-based weapons systems.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to be the arbiter
of these or other competing

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:90%
theories.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:90%
I will, however, offer you this.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:10%
Never in the history of
steel frame architecture,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:10%
not before 9/11 or
since, had fires,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:10%
even fires that raged
for days and consumed

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:10%
much of the building,
had ever caused

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:10%
the collapse of a
steel-framed structure.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet on September
11, 2001, it

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
happened not once, not
twice, but three times

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
because another building
came down that day as well,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:90%
famously known as Building 7.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
The World Trade Center was
a seven-building complex

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and Building 7 was
47 stories tall.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:90%
No aircraft hit it.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Yet just like the
North and South towers

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
earlier that day, it
came down at 5:20 PM

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:90%
amid huge billows of dust.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there was a fire
on one of the floors.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:84%
But this was not a
towering inferno.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, watch
the building fall.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.610 align:middle line:10%
You see the roof
cave in slightly

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.770 align:middle line:10%
and then the entire
structure comes down

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:10%
at virtual free fall speed.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
It hits the ground
at 6.3 seconds.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
All the available
evidence on Building 7

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
prior to its collapse
doesn't show anything more

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
than superficial
structural damage

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
from the earlier destruction
of the Twin Towers

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%
and a few isolated fires.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
The thing about Building
7, it fell straight down.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:10%
That meant, as with
the two other towers,

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.670 align:middle line:10%
all of the load-bearing
columns had

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:10%
to be broken at the same moment.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:10%
You need that kind of
precision if you're

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.260 align:middle line:10%
going to prevent a building
from toppling over.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
That's what the science
of controlled demolition

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
is all about, which,
of course, that

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what it looks like.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
In the history of
architecture, the only times

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.010 align:middle line:84%
a steel-framed
structure came down

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
like this was when a controlled
demolition was responsible,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:90%
never any other time.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And yet this question has never
been asked by the establishment

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.041 align:middle line:90%
media.

00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
All three of the
buildings came down

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to virtual free fall speed, all
that steel, all that support,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
all that matter offering zero
resistance to the rate of fall.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
We were told that the fire
melted the steel, well,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:90%
initially.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Then the argument was modified
because it was ludicrous.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Steel won't melt until it
reaches 1,500 degrees Celsius.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't get such temperatures
without pressurized air

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:90%
like you get in a blast furnace.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So, instead, we were told
that the heat from the fires

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
weakened the steel
enough in both cases

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to bring them down in a huge
pile of dust at free fall

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:90%
speed.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Scientific Americans said
this with a straight face

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:90%
as early as October 2001.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.990 align:middle line:84%
BBC told us, Popular Mechanics,
NOVA documentaries, and so on.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
They all said the fire
getting as hot as 800 degrees

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.130 align:middle line:84%
weakened the steel supporting
the buildings enough to bring

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
them both down, and
I guess Building 7,

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%
which they never talked about.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.140 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:84%
What we are seldom
told is how unlikely

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
it was that these fires
could have reached

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:84%
the temperatures necessary to
do that for any length of time,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in particular, the South
Tower fires, surprisingly

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
not that big a deal, at least
from a structural standpoint.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:84%
They never spread to the
opposite side of the building

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:84%
and gave off a darkening
smoke that dwindled

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:90%
as the morning progressed.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.560 align:middle line:84%
There were not even any visible
flames before it came down.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
The Fire Chief,
Orio Palmer, who was

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:84%
on the 78th floor
of the South Tower

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
described the fire
in that building as,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.618 align:middle line:90%
quote, two isolated pockets.

00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:40.034 align:middle line:10%
>>ORIO PALMER: We've got two
isolated pockets of fire.

00:07:40.034 --> 00:07:42.474 align:middle line:10%
We should be able to knock
it down with two lines.

00:07:42.474 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:10%
Radio that, 78th floor,
numerous 10-45 code one's.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: He went on to
tell his comrades, quote,

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:84%
we should be able to knock
it down with two lines.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The official report on
9/11 concealed the fact

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
that the firefighters had
reached the crash zone.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:84%
This should be no surprise
since, in the case of the South

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Tower strike, most of the
fuel probably burned up

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
in the impact fireball.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Look at the photograph.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is that the
fires in the two towers

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
went through a
similar progression.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Initially, in each you see
widespread, visible flames

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:90%
and light gray smoke.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Then the flames became smaller
and the smoke became darker.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
When you get dark smoke
and no visible flames,

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
it means less heat,
less intensity,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
not a pressurized,
intense inferno.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.400 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't help but go back to
this video of a vertical steel

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
column simply vanishing
before my eyes.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:84%
It didn't crumple up or
fall over or stand up

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
jutting into the air
like you would expect.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
No, it disintegrates
before our eyes.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.390 align:middle line:84%
You see, the buildings
of the World Trade Center

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.920 align:middle line:90%
didn't collapse.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
They disintegrated into an
exploding cloud of dust.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about 1,000 feet
of intact structural steel

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:10%
and cement
obliterated instantly.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Never mind that no steel-framed
skyscraper had ever

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
totally collapsed due to any
cause or combination of causes.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:84%
We're talking bombings, fires,
earthquakes, hurricanes,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.810 align:middle line:90%
nothing other than demolition.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Never mind that the incredible
disintegration of the towers

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:84%
didn't look like
anything that has ever

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:84%
happened, not once, not
twice, but three times.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.630 align:middle line:90%
And why did Building 7 fall?

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But any true
forensic analysis was

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.760 align:middle line:84%
prevented since
this 16-acre crime

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.900 align:middle line:84%
scene was off limits to any
independent investigation,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
indeed, off limits
to any investigation

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
since all of the steel
was removed and destroyed

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
immediately after the
fall of the buildings.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:10%
These were the three
largest structural failures

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:10%
in history, no investigation.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:10%
Oh, sure, the government issued
a report some years later.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:10%
But there is no way to do
a proper investigation.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Just 11 days after
the attack, a company

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:84%
called Controlled
Demolition, which

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:84%
did the cleanup after the
Oklahoma City bombing,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
got the contract to remove
the debris at the World Trade

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:84%
The steel was sold cheap
to scrap metal vendors

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and most of it was quickly
shipped to India and China.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Trucks hauling the
steel were even

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
outfitted with
$1,000 GPS locators.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
The public was completely
banned from the area.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
When the government
did issue its report,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
it never addressed
the basic questions.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.660 align:middle line:84%
It never brought up the history
of steel-framed structures,

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:84%
never addressed how the massive
core columns just melted away.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly did not
address how Building 7 came down

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:90%
into a pile of dust.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:84%
But, oh, much of the World Trade
Center may have disintegrated.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:84%
But we did learn that one of the
hijacker's passports was found.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:90%
How lucky.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.540 align:middle line:10%
Among the mountains
of debris, we

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle line:10%
are told that the passport
of hijacker Satam al-Suqami

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:10%
was found a few blocks from
the World Trade Center.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.710 align:middle line:84%
He was supposedly on
Flight 11, the plane

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:90%
that hit the North Tower.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Just to remind you,
in that collision,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:84%
the building's core absorbed
almost the entire airplane.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, the BBC announced
the fall of Building 7

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
20 minutes before it happened.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BBC ANCHORMAN: -the Salomon
Brothers building collapsing.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:90%
And, indeed, it has.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It seems that this was not
the result of a new attack.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It was because the
building had been weakened

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:90%
during this morning's attacks.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We'll probably find
out more about that

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
from our correspondent,
Jane Stanley.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Jane, what more can you tell
us about the Salomon Brothers

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.377 align:middle line:90%
building and its collapse?

00:11:35.377 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>JANE STANLEY: Well, only
really what you already know.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Details are very, very sketchy.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.650 align:middle line:84%
As you can see behind
me, the Trade Center

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.340 align:middle line:90%
appears to be still burning.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:10%
We see these huge
clouds of smoke and ash.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And we know that behind there
is an empty piece of what

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.320 align:middle line:84%
was a very familiar New
York skyline, a symbol

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.030 align:middle line:84%
of the financial prosperity
of this city that's completely

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:90%
disappeared now.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And New York is still
unable to take on board what

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.714 align:middle line:90%
has happened to them today.

00:12:06.714 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: On this broadcast,
when it was announced,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:84%
you actually see the
building in the backdrop.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, yeah, we have
the famous statement

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of World Trade Center building
owner, Larry Silverstein,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.934 align:middle line:84%
who talked about how Building
7 needed to be pulled.

00:12:19.934 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>> LARRY SILVERSTEIN:
As you know,

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
we've had such
terrible loss of life.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.131 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the smartest
thing to do is pull it.

00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:10%
And they made that
decision to pull.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.676 align:middle line:84%
And then we watched
the building collapse.

00:12:31.676 --> 00:12:36.849 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.849 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Now, regarding
New York, clearly

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
the cause of why the towers
fell has not been adequately

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:90%
explained, officially at least.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the Pentagon,
more serious problems

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:90%
of explanation.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:84%
American Airlines
Flight 77, a Boeing 757,

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.540 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to have crashed
into the Pentagon at 9:37 AM.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
There are several pieces of
physical evidence and elements

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.670 align:middle line:84%
of the body of
eyewitness evidence

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that rule out the official
account of the crash.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Officially, the flight
was taken over hundreds

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
of miles away by a suicide
pilot named Hani Hanjour and two

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:90%
accomplices.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
He presumably fought his
way into the cockpit,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
took out the two pilots, even
though one was a former F-4

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Fighter jock and a tough
looking guy if you ask me,

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:84%
somehow got control
over the aircraft,

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
even though he flunked a
flight test the previous month

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:84%
for a puddle-jumping Cessna,
had the presence of mind to turn

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:84%
off his transponder, turn the
plane around above the clouds,

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
then, surpassing Christopher
Columbus in the art of dead

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.880 align:middle line:84%
reckoning, flew with precision
back to DC, saw his target,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
swooped down 7,000 feet in
three minutes in a beautiful

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:90%
corkscrew maneuver--

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
so good, by the way, that the
air traffic controllers assumed

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.860 align:middle line:84%
that he was a jet fighter and
said, thank God, where have you

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:90%
guys been all the time--

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and approaching the Pentagon
at such a shallow angle

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that its wings clipped
lampposts on the highway

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
at an altitude of 20 feet
and a speed of roughly

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:90%
400 miles per hour--

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
which is, by the way,
essentially an impossibility

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:84%
for a plane of that
size and type--

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and then plows into
the first floor

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
of the newly renovated
west block of the Pentagon.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I have interviewed
three commercial pilots

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:90%
about that particular maneuver.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
All of them said they
could not have executed

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:90%
such an amazing maneuver.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, any
commercial aircraft

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
that is clipping
multiple lampposts

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:middle line:90%
is not going to keep flying.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
It's going to crash
into the ground

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.650 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of fire and
metal and bodies all around.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, all we have in
terms of evidence

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
are a couple of fuzzy still
frames from a webcam attached

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.080 align:middle line:90%
to the Pentagon.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a rooftop video
on a nearby Sheraton Hotel

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:90%
which captured the event.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
We have never seen
it, ditto, a video

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.650 align:middle line:84%
from a gas station next door
which also captured the event,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
confiscated by
government agents.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, 9/11 researchers have
identified many other video

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
cameras that capture this
event, no video of which

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.309 align:middle line:90%
has ever been made public.

00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
The pattern of damage
to the building

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:13.260 align:middle line:84%
itself is not consistent
with the impact of a 757.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Evidence of aircraft
debris is scarce.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And conspicuously absent
are recognizable objects

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.085 align:middle line:90%
like luggage, seats, and bodies.

00:15:21.085 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
The lawn of the
Pentagon looks like you

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.362 align:middle line:90%
could have a picnic on it.

00:15:24.362 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CNN ANCHORMAN: You know, it
might have appeared that way.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:10%
But from my close-up
inspection, there's

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:10%
no evidence of a plane
having crashed anywhere

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:10%
near the Pentagon.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.370 align:middle line:84%
The only site is the
actual site of the building

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:90%
that's crashed in.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:10%
And as I said, the only
pieces left that you can see

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:10%
are small enough that you
could pick up in your hand.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.605 align:middle line:84%
There are no large tail
sections, wing sections,

00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:84%
a fuselage, nothing like
that anywhere around,

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
which would indicate that
the entire plane crashed

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.427 align:middle line:90%
into the side of the Pentagon.

00:15:53.427 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Only one
piece of aircraft debris

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
larger than small shards was
seen by passersby outside

00:15:58.980 --> 00:15:59.790 align:middle line:90%
of the building.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:10%
And that piece which has been
identified as from an American

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:10%
Airlines 757 has been
called into question

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:10%
by a number of 9/11 researchers
who argue that it was planted.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might think
that's going too far.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, no other
significant debris

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:90%
has ever been shown.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:90%
It's very odd to say the least.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, the hole in
the Pentagon itself

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
surely does not
seem large enough

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:84%
to have taken in the
full width of the wings

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:90%
and tail of the airplane.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Even if those parts
were shredded on impact,

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:84%
they should have left a few tons
of debris outside the building.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:10%
Also, people who
were on the scene

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:10%
could not explain what happened
to 60 tons of aluminum that

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.850 align:middle line:10%
supposedly hit the Pentagon.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Arlington County Fire
Chief, Ed Plaugher,

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:90%
was there on the scene.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
On the day after the attack,
a journalist asked him,

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
is there anything left
of the aircraft at all?

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.534 align:middle line:10%
And here's what he said.

00:16:53.534 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:10%
>>ED PLAUGHER: First off, the
question about the aircraft,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:10%
there are some small
pieces of aircraft

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:10%
visible from the interior
during this firefighting

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.526 align:middle line:10%
operation I'm talking about,
but not large sections.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's
no fuselage sections

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.935 align:middle line:84%
>>PRESS INTERVIEWER:
Chief, there

00:17:11.935 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:84%
were small pieces of
the plane virtually all

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:90%
over the highway, tiny pieces.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Would you say the plane
exploded, virtually exploded,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.847 align:middle line:90%
on impact due to the fuselage?

00:17:19.847 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ED PLAUGHER: You know, I'd
rather not comment on that.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.596 align:middle line:10%
We have a lot of
eyewitnesses that

00:17:23.596 --> 00:17:26.312 align:middle line:10%
can give you better information
about what actually happened

00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:10%
with the aircraft
as it approached.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.925 align:middle line:10%
So we don't know.

00:17:28.925 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Oh, so you'd
rather not comment on that.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's great.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.230 align:middle line:84%
There are images
showing what can

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
happen to a commercial jet when
it hits birds while in flight.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The damage sometimes
can be severe.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
When you consider that
an airplane fuselage is

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
essentially a hollow
tube, you have

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:84%
to wonder, how is
it going to punch

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
a deep hole through reinforced
concrete, the headquarters

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.016 align:middle line:84%
of the world's most
powerful military?

00:17:53.016 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
A couple of other things
about the Pentagon strike,

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.290 align:middle line:84%
several witnesses
described a shockwave

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that knocked them to the
ground, both inside and outside

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:90%
the building.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Several described
it as a concussion.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:10%
Now, maybe it was as
the government claimed

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.460 align:middle line:10%
and the jetliner had the
world's greatest hijacker pilot,

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:10%
made the world's most
impossible moves, slammed

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:10%
into the Pentagon, and
essentially disappeared

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:10%
into the building, leaving no
fuselage or parts that the fire

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:10%
chief could identify.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, most
of the specific evidence

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that would prove it
really was Flight 77

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:90%
is unavailable to the public.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.610 align:middle line:84%
The entire scenario appears
incredibly improbable.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And all we have ever had to
support the official story

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:84%
are statements from
the authorities,

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:90%
no evidence of any sort.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Now we move on to the
crash of United 93

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.140 align:middle line:90%
in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
One question,
where is the plane?

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:84%
No image of the plane
exists anywhere.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NEWS ANCHOR: The reason why
it's so hard for investigators

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
to find out what happened here
is because there's practically

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:90%
nothing left of the aircraft.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
That crater you see behind
where all of those workers are

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
is the point of impact where
the plane fell from the sky.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.094 align:middle line:90%
And that is all that is left.

00:19:06.094 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: We're told
some really silly things

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
like the plane melted
right into the ground.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, but that's not how
planes crash into hard ground.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Even somewhat softer ground
is unbelievably dense.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:84%
A large commercial
airliner is not

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:90%
going to dive into the ground.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Something hit the ground, yes.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:90%
But where was the plane?

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:84%
What exactly happened
at Shanksville?

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Then there are the phone calls.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:84%
You may recall a number
of cell phone calls

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:84%
were allegedly made that day by
people in the various hijacked

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.514 align:middle line:90%
planes.

00:19:36.514 --> 00:19:37.930 align:middle line:84%
To be exact, there
were said to be

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.870 align:middle line:84%
15 calls that were
described at the time

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
as cell phone calls and about
10 of those were from Flight 93.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:10%
>>FEMALE AUTOMATION:
Tuesday 9:47 AM.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:10%
>>CEECEE: Hi, baby.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm-- baby, you have to
listen to me carefully.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm on a plane
that's been hijacked.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the plane.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.276 align:middle line:90%
I'm calling from the plane.

00:19:56.276 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:90%
I want to tell you I love you.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Please tell my children
that I love them very much.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so sorry, babe.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to say.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:90%
There's three guys.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.224 align:middle line:90%
They hijacked the plane.

00:20:07.224 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to be calm.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.246 align:middle line:10%
We're turned around.

00:20:10.246 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:10%
And I heard that there's
planes that that's been flown

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.666 align:middle line:10%
into the World Trade center.

00:20:14.666 --> 00:20:17.618 align:middle line:84%
I hope to be able to see
your face again, baby.

00:20:17.618 --> 00:20:19.094 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:20.855 align:middle line:10%
Goodbye.

00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: It was so
dramatic that they

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
gave an image to the world
of passengers fighting back

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:30.211 align:middle line:84%
to take control of the aircraft
and was even made into a movie.

00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>FLIGHT 93 ACTOR:
We have to do it now

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:84%
because we know what
happens if we just sit here

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.606 align:middle line:90%
and do nothing.

00:20:36.606 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: Well,
many researchers

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.450 align:middle line:90%
have looked into this.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
The superb 9/11 researcher,
David Ray Griffin,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:90%
wrote about these phone calls.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:10%
He pointed out that cell phone
technology available in 2001

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:10%
made it impossible for cell
phone calls from airliners

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.450 align:middle line:10%
at altitudes of more
than a few thousand feet,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:10%
especially calls lasting
more than a few seconds.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:10%
And yet many of the
reported cell phone calls

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:10%
happened when the planes were
above 25,000 feet or even

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:10%
40,000 feet.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And several of these
lasted a minute or more.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.750 align:middle line:84%
One of them reportedly
lasted for 12 minutes.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:84%
He cited the work of Canadian
scientist and mathematician,

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:84%
A.K. Dewdney, who demonstrated
this impossibility, at least

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
the impossibility
of all but two calls

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
which were made from
less than 5,000 feet.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:10%
At 20,000 feet, Dewdney wrote,
the chance of a typical cell

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:10%
phone call making it to ground
and engaging a cell site,

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:10%
there is less than one in 100.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:38.520 align:middle line:10%
The probability that two callers
will succeed is less than one

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:10%
in 10,000.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
The likelihood of
13 successful calls,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Dewdney added, would
be infinitesimal.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, there are real
oddities about the strategy

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:84%
of the hijackers
themselves and definitely

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.130 align:middle line:84%
about the response of
the jet interceptors.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
The four planes
commandeered on September 11

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
either flew to their targets
from distant airports

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:84%
or flew hundreds of miles
away from their targets

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.160 align:middle line:90%
before turning around.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.990 align:middle line:84%
There are three
international airports

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.970 align:middle line:84%
within five minutes
flying distance

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:90%
from the World Trade Center.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Yet the hijackers selected
Flights 11 and 175

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
originating from Boston,
which is 40 minutes' flight

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:90%
time away.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Flight 77, the plane that we
are told hit the Pentagon,

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.630 align:middle line:84%
took off from
Dulles just a couple

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:90%
of miles away from the Pentagon.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:10%
Yet the hijackers waited
almost until the plane reached

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:10%
Kentucky before taking it over.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Flight 93 took off from
Newark, New Jersey.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
If the hijackers had taken it
over shortly after takeoff,

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:84%
they could have reached
Washington in about 30 minutes.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they waited until
it was near Cleveland, Ohio

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:48.410 align:middle line:90%
before turning it around.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Anyone planning such
an attack could easily

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
find out that any
hijacked airplane would

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.840 align:middle line:84%
be intercepted within
20 minutes anywhere

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:90%
in the Northeast Corridor.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But these guys chose
to depart from airports

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:84%
over 100 miles from their
targets in three of the cases

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and waiting for nearly a
half hour in all four cases

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:84%
before they took
over the flights.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:84%
That's one heck of a way
to expose the entire plot

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:84%
to certain interception if
air defenses were operating

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:90%
normally.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But maybe these people realize
that the air defense system

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.730 align:middle line:90%
would not be operational.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.360 align:middle line:84%
For domestic air defense, the
US has a nationwide air traffic

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.610 align:middle line:84%
control system that
is continuously

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:90%
monitoring air traffic.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
In cases of any deviations of
any aircraft from their flight

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:84%
paths or loss of radio contact,
air traffic controllers

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
notify NORAD, that's North
American Air Defense.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.400 align:middle line:84%
NORAD is constantly monitoring
air and space traffic.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.600 align:middle line:84%
If there is an
emergency of any kind,

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:84%
it can order the Air Force
or other armed services

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
to scramble fighters to
deal with the situation.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.350 align:middle line:84%
On September 11, 2001,
every part of that system

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:90%
broke down, every part.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We know, based on the
official timeline,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
the response times for
reporting the deviating aircraft

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:84%
were many times longer than
they were supposed to be.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Then NORAD, once notified
of the off-course aircraft,

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
failed to scramble jets
from the nearest bases.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they scrambled them
from much more distant bases.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Then, once airborne,
the interceptors

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.020 align:middle line:90%
failed to reach their targets.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Because they flew at small
fractions of their top speeds.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes they flew
in the wrong directions.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Had there not been multiple
failures at each stage,

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
if even one procedure
of the process

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:84%
had been followed correctly, the
attack could have been stopped.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
NORAD had time to protect
the World Trade Center,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.770 align:middle line:84%
even given the unbelievably
late time when it claims

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:90%
to have been first notified.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.930 align:middle line:10%
It had time to protect the
South Tower and Washington,

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.750 align:middle line:10%
even given its bizarre
choices of bases

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.820 align:middle line:10%
from which to scramble planes.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And it still had
ample opportunity

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to protect both New York City
and Washington even if it

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
insisted that all interceptors
fly subsonic simply

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:84%
by redeploying
airborne fighters.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.890 align:middle line:90%
But everything failed.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:84%
There is certainly more
suspicious behavior about 9/11

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:84%
including several events
immediately preceding

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.800 align:middle line:84%
the event suggesting that
many people anticipated

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
the attack, extremely large
amounts of insider trading

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.760 align:middle line:84%
in what are known
as put options.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:84%
A put option on Wall Street is
an agreement, well, an option,

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to sell assets at
an agreed price

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.830 align:middle line:90%
on or before a particular date.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.940 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, it's really
good for insider traders

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
who know that a certain
stock is going to fall.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
You get to sell at a
much higher price that's

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:90%
been previously agreed upon.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
This happened in massive numbers
to United Airlines and American

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:90%
Airlines stocks.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Someone knew what
was going down.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Same thing for put options
on reinsurance companies

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
expected to pay out
billions to cover losses

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.910 align:middle line:84%
from the attack, Munich
Re and the AXA Group

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as financial services
companies like Merrill

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and
Bank of America, all of whom

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.490 align:middle line:90%
were badly hurt by the attack.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.410 align:middle line:84%
A number of important
people admitted

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:84%
to have been warned
not to fly that day.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps most well-known was San
Francisco Mayor, Willie Brown.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.880 align:middle line:90%
But there were many others.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.090 align:middle line:84%
There was Donald Rumsfeld's
statement shortly before 9/11

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.972 align:middle line:84%
that the Pentagon
had lost $2 trillion.

00:26:24.972 --> 00:26:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DONALD RUMSFELD:
According to some estimates,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
we cannot track $2.3 trillion
dollars in transactions.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>TV HOST: $2.3
trillion with a T.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.139 align:middle line:84%
That's $8,000 for every man,
woman, and child in America.

00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARD: There is
the privatization

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.340 align:middle line:84%
of the World Trade Center just
six weeks before the attack.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:90%
There were the war games.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.320 align:middle line:84%
The late 9/11 researcher and
former LAPD Detective Michael

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Rupert uncovered something
of great importance.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:84%
In May of 2001, Vice
President Dick Cheney

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:84%
was placed directly
in charge of managing

00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:01.165 align:middle line:84%
the, quote, seamless integration
of all training exercises

00:27:01.165 --> 00:27:02.540 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
federal government

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and military agencies.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:10%
Not only did the morning of 9/11
begin with multiple training

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:10%
exercises of war games
and terror drills,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:10%
but Cheney was in
charge of managing them.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:84%
These included
live fly exercises

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:21.260 align:middle line:84%
with military aircraft
posing as hijacked aircraft

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:84%
over the United States as well
as simulated exercises that

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
placed false blips, that
is radar blips indicating

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
virtual planes, on
FAA radar screens.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:84%
One exercise titled Northern
Vigilance pulled Air Force

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:84%
fighters up into Canada
simulating a Russian air

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.010 align:middle line:90%
attack.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So there were very few fighters
remaining on the East coast

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:90%
to respond.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
All of this paralyzed Air
Force response or at least

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
helped significantly
to hamper it.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Dick Cheney also happened to
be one of the main government

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.930 align:middle line:84%
officials deciding that these
extensive war games would

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.300 align:middle line:90%
take place on that day.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.700 align:middle line:84%
It's worth bearing in mind
that American intelligence

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:84%
had collected dozens of
warnings from governments

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence agencies
indicating that terrorists were

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.280 align:middle line:84%
planning to hijack
civilian aircraft

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and crash them into American
targets on the ground

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:84%
during the week of
September 9th, 2001.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.620 align:middle line:84%
9/11 did not come
out of the blue.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It was entirely within the realm
of possible expected events,

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
unlike what the US
government later claimed.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And Dick Cheney effectively
was running the show that day.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, my goodness, we have
gone into a great deal

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is we've
only scratched the surface.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, 9/11 has
been covered many times.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Still, it never hurts to
keep talking about 9/11.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.800 align:middle line:84%
After 15 years, there's
still great value

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.760 align:middle line:84%
in talking about this event
with a critical and clear eye.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.830 align:middle line:84%
We delve into these matters
as we do for a reason.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.114 align:middle line:84%
When our rights are taken away,
we have the right to know why.

00:28:56.114 --> 00:28:58.280 align:middle line:84%
When our own government
attacks us and then tells us

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that it needs more power in
order to make us more safe,

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.020 align:middle line:90%
we can question that.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to be taken
in by the illusions.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Because if we seek
transformation,

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:84%
we need truth as our
constant companion.

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.050 align:middle line:90%
