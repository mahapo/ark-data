of the Islamic caliphate, who
viewed the ancient monuments not

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:10%
as a precious legacy from a
sophisticated civilization,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.055 align:middle line:10%

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:90%
or by whom--

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:84%
only a consensus that
they were erected

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
in prehistoric times and
absolutely not as burial places.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
The idea that Pharaohs
Khafre, Khufu, and Menkaure

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
were responsible for
the pyramids of Giza

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:84%
began with an opinion by
the Roman historian Pliny

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
the Elder, who
claimed pyramids to be

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
the idle and vain ostentation
of the wealth of kings.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:10%
Academic consensus
followed that the monuments

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:10%
were built by these pharaohs
after 2600 BC, supported

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.710 align:middle line:10%
by a carbon-14 date taken
from mortar between the stone

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:10%
blocks of the Great Pyramid.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:84%
The problem is ancient Egyptians
used massive blocks of stone

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.250 align:middle line:84%
so well-fitted they
required no mortar.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the dating only confirms
restoration work carried out

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:90%
during that period.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
The rest is based on
circumstantial evidence

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
The fact is, that within
a short historical span,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
even Pharaoh
Amenhotep III did not

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:84%

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.960 align:middle line:84%
The Khufu had found an adjacent

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%

carried out restoration work

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
to this and adjacent
monuments built by the gods.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
To this effect, he
proceeded to build

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.760 align:middle line:84%
a small pyramid for his daughter
beside this temple known

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
as Structure G1C, and
next to it a pyramid

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.153 align:middle line:84%
for himself, most likely the
small pyramid numbered G1D.

00:06:25.153 --> 00:06:30.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are six of
these small pyramids.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists claim them to
be the burial places for wives

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and daughters of the
pharaohs who built the larger

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:90%
pyramids behind them.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
But if all these structures
were built in the same period,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:84%
then it is odd that the small
pyramids are significantly

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:90%
inferior of construction.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%

larger neighbors,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
the quality of stone
masonry is notably poor.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And the manner in which the
blocks have been assembled

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
is comparatively slipshod and
lacks the same engineering

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:90%

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, early Arab
historians were well aware

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
that the Great
Pyramid itself was

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:84%
built in prehistoric times, when
Vega was the de facto pole star.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%

provides us with a working range

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
of 12,000 to 10,000 BC, and
within this range falls the date

of arrival in Egypt of
the followers of Horus.

their less impressive monuments

Yunu was an island

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:10%

Just south of Yunu, on
the Hill of Thanksgiving,

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.700 align:middle line:84%
in the heart of
Cairo's old citadel,

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.770 align:middle line:84%
sits the Mosque of Ibn Tulun,
one of the city's oldest.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:10%
In the central courtyard,
a fountain for cleansing

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:10%
is flanked by a minaret with a
spiral staircase for the muezzin

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.700 align:middle line:10%
to sing the call to prayer.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:10%
In this mosque, there
are six prayer niches.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The mihrab should
point to Mecca,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:84%
but missed their intended
target by 90 miles.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Like all European churches
built over earlier sacred sites,

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:84%
this mosque appears to conceal
a more ancient footprint.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
From this elevated
position in Cairo,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.980 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
possible to see

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:84%
both Yunu and the
Giza plateau, making

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.800 align:middle line:84%
it an ideal platform for an
ancient surveyor planning

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.700 align:middle line:84%
to build something
impressive across the river.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Both sites are exactly eight
miles from today's mosque.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So it is likely the two were
planned in the same era.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
When it came to erecting
monuments in the ancient world,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.965 align:middle line:84%
architects aligned their work to
a prominent object in the sky.

00:11:17.965 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:10%
Such sky-ground referencing
established an umbilical cord

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:10%
with a rising sun, moon,
or a star or constellation,

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:10%
in order to bestow
upon the temple

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:10%
the symbolism or
quality and energy

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.826 align:middle line:10%
with which the celestial
body was associated.

00:11:34.826 --> 00:11:38.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:84%
As such, the process
also memorialized

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.150 align:middle line:90%
the date of construction.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
With regard to Egypt, the three
Giza pyramids form a mirror

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
image of the constellation
directly associated with

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
the followers of Horus, Orion,
when on the winter solstice

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:84%
of 10,450 BC, they matched the
alignment of its three belt

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:90%
stars.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
At the same moment, an observer
on the plateau would also have

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
seen Sirius, the star
associated with wisdom,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
rising above the sacred mound
Yunu and its academy of ancient

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, all of which
coincides with that unexplained

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:84%
agricultural revolution in
the Nile Valley in 10,500 BC.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.280 align:middle line:84%
An enterprise of this
scale was clearly

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.890 align:middle line:84%
beyond the capacity
of hunter-gatherers.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It is the product of people
with a long and proven history

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
in engineering, social planning,
and monumental construction,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
along with skills in astronomy,
mathematics, geomancy, masonry,

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
transportation,
and organization--

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
skills requiring
hundreds if not thousands

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:90%
of years of development.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.180 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Such a civilization profile fits
the followers of Horus well.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, there exists
an uncomfortable document

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:90%
called the Turin papyrus.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It's uncomfortable insofar
as it lists nine dynasties

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.510 align:middle line:90%
of Predynastic pharaohs.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:84%
The oldest, the
Venables of Memphis,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
gods such as Ra, Osiris, Isis,
Horus, Set, and Djehuti--

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:90%
whom later Greeks called Thoth--

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:90%
reigned for 23,200 years.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:10%
They were succeeded by the
followers of Horus for 13,420

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:10%
years, until Pharaoh Mena--

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:10%
who is described as the first
of a purely human bloodline--

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:10%
took the throne of
Egypt in 3100 BC.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
That places the start of the
Egyptian dynasty in 39,720 BC.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Speaking to the Greek scholar
Solon during his visit

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.500 align:middle line:84%
to the academy at
Sais, around 600 BC,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:84%
an Egyptian priest
explained that in their time

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.740 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians have seen the
course of stars change direction

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:84%
four times, experienced the
Earth rotating backwards,

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and the sun setting in the
part of the sky where it rises

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:90%
today, twice.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.910 align:middle line:84%
To which the priest remarked in
jest, "You Greeks are too young.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Wait until you've been
around as long as we have,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and written on the walls of our
temples all notable events that

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.195 align:middle line:90%
have reached our ears."

00:14:26.195 --> 00:14:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There are other clues
pointing to an older age

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:84%
for the pyramids of Giza and
their surrounding temples,

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and they begin at the
foot of the plateau.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.030 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Two temples form the
entrance to Giza.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Still visible in
front are the remnants

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
of two piers, from a time when
the Nile was six miles closer,

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:84%
surrounding the Valley
Temple and turning it

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:84%
into an artificial
island, in the process,

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:84%
illustrating the creation myth
in which a mound rises out

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
of the waters of chaos
and is impregnated

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
with a knowledge of the
universe by a creator god.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:84%
This sacred act forms the
foundation of the temple.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And it is from
this perfect seed,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
this mirror of
cosmic perfection,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.435 align:middle line:90%
that civilization grows.

00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Two entrances lead to
an interior courtyard,

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
where masculine
pink granite columns

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
rise from the alabaster floor
representing the feminine,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.080 align:middle line:90%
the cosmic marriage.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Thick architraves once supported
the stone roof marked with slits

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
to allow slivers of light to
illuminate 23 statues that

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:90%
stood in recesses on the floor.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Each honored the
eight primeval gods,

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.510 align:middle line:84%
along with the
seven ancestor gods

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and the eight
followers of Horus.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
The creative principle,
Atum, is represented

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:84%
by the temple itself, so that
when one enters the building,

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
one enters the body
of a living entity.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
The design in the shape of a T
represents the breath of god,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:84%
just as it does in
Hopi and Mayan temples.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:84%
In the dimly lit interior
of the stone womb,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
visitors were reminded
of the entities

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
the first occasion,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:84%
as well as the root
of Egyptian culture.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:84%
A close look behind
the granite facade

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
reveals an inner core composed
of massive limestone blocks.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
They're in an advanced
state of erosion, scoured

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.740 align:middle line:84%
by prolonged periods
of rain, and carved

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:90%
by a fast moving body of water.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet the region only
experienced such a pluvial

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.210 align:middle line:84%
climate between
10,500 and 7000 BC,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.244 align:middle line:84%
before arid conditions
gradually became the norm.

00:17:10.244 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
By contrast, the granite
lining shows hardly

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
any deterioration,
not surprising

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.980 align:middle line:84%
given there is a
harder material.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:84%
But still, one would
expect some erosion on par

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.249 align:middle line:90%
with the inner wall.

00:17:25.249 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
The interior walls appear to
be a much later restoration,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:84%
including this lone
block of diorite,

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that is in pristine
condition and stands out

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.990 align:middle line:90%
amid a sea of red granite.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
A close look at
the exterior indeed

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:84%
reveals that the Valley
Temple has been the subject

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.196 align:middle line:90%
of an ongoing restoration.

00:17:48.196 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
The larger and
older granite slabs

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
are fitted very precisely, while
more recent work is less so

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and required the use
of mortar, indicating

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
how subsequent stonemasons
lacked the understanding

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.790 align:middle line:84%
and finesse of
their predecessors.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The smoothly finished
granite outer stones

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.300 align:middle line:84%
have been pillaged
for houses and mosques

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
in Cairo, exposing
the extreme erosion.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But the temple also shows
evidence of having been rebuilt.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
The monolithic blocks were hit
by a colossal force of nature,

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
causing them to be
dislodged then placed back.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Because they have been
repositioned upside

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:90%
down, and even back to front.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.950 align:middle line:84%
There has also
been a remodeling.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
The orientation of
a passageway leading

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
uphill and towards
the middle pyramid

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.070 align:middle line:84%
is both awkward
and aesthetically

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.055 align:middle line:84%
at odds with the otherwise
harmonious plan of the Valley

00:18:57.055 --> 00:18:57.855 align:middle line:90%
Temple.

00:18:57.855 --> 00:19:00.525 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:84%
A stela found nearby states
that the monument was considered

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
extremely ancient, even 5,000
years ago in the time of Khufu.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
It was believed to have been the
work of the followers of Horus

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
during the first
occasion, when it was

The same extreme water erosion,
inconsistent weathering,

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and obvious
replacement of walls,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.770 align:middle line:84%

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:90%
it was pillaged a long time ago.

the Sphinx itself--

or to address it by its real
name, Sheshep Ankh, The Eternal

Image.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.955 align:middle line:90%
But eternal image of what?

00:19:56.955 --> 00:20:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a degree in
art to notice that the head is

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:90%
out of proportion to the body.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.410 align:middle line:90%
It is too small.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And as far as we know, there was
no tradition in ancient Egypt

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:90%
of shrunken heads.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, this portion
of the limestone outcrop

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:90%
has been recarved.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:10%
And although
Egyptologists adamantly

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:10%
believe Khafre carved the
Sphinx in his own image,

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.350 align:middle line:10%
the angle of profile
of the pharaoh's face

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:10%
differs significantly
from that on Sheshep Ankh.

had carried out repairs

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
to the monument then
called Haremakhet,

Horus of the Horizon.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Thus, it cannot be the
image of Khufu either.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years later, Thutmoses IV
placed a stela between the paws

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
of Sheshep Ankh.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:84%
In the accompanying
inscription, the pharaoh

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:84%
states how he seated
himself under the shadow

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:90%
of this mighty god.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So even in his time,
the head had yet

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.630 align:middle line:90%
to be recarved into human form.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Nor does the face
on the stela itself

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:84%
resemble anything close to the
one on the monument above it.

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
We simply do not know
whose image it represents.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:10%
But what is certain is that the
missing nose was broken in 1378,

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:10%
in an act of vandalism by the
Muslim extremist Muhammad Sa'im

If early Egyptian scribes
are correct in that the Giza

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:84%
monuments formed
a complete whole,

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:84%

on the winter

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:84%
it follows that Sheshep Ankh
too would have been the mirror

Barely a mile away, in

is undoubtedly the most

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.965 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid with two angles,
the so-called Bent Pyramid.

how such monuments once

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.990 align:middle line:84%
resembled neat
geometric forms rising

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:90%
above a verdant landscape.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.480 align:middle line:84%
As with every other pyramid,
its shaft points to true north

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and towards the pole star.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Unlike other pyramids, it
features a second shaft

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.840 align:middle line:84%
located very high up the face
and the line to true west.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:84%
To access the interior, it
is once again, necessary

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.790 align:middle line:84%
to climb some
distance up the face

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and crawl back down an awkward
shaft 220 feet in length.

The shaft bores back
deep into bedrock

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:84%
to reach a platform upon which
a formidable chamber was raised.

The corbelled ceiling
rises 50 feet.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you reach the top
via modern wooden staircase,

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.030 align:middle line:84%
you are finally level
with the original bedrock

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:90%
outside the pyramid.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:84%
From here, a rough
tunnel was hacked out

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:84%
to connect with the west shaft
that leads to a second chamber.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And after all this effort, you
are finally above the bedrock

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:47.040 align:middle line:90%
and inside the actual pyramid.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.370 align:middle line:84%
To make sense of this, imagine
cutting a large hole out

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:84%
of the bedrock, inside which
you build a chamber followed

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.150 align:middle line:84%
by another and its horizontal
passage on the adjacent bedrock,

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:84%

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.540 align:middle line:84%
was one purpose behind
these structures.

But what makes the Bent Pyramid
a symbol of utmost perfection?

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.612 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the two
slopes are the clue.

00:36:40.612 --> 00:36:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Considered by Egyptologists
to be a mistake,

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:84%
the Bent Pyramid's two unusual
angles are, in fact, ingenious.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.690 align:middle line:84%
The cosine of the upper
slope equals tangent 36,

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.230 align:middle line:84%
an integral angle
of the pentagram,

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:middle line:84%
while the cosine
of the lower slope

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:03.820 align:middle line:84%
equals tangent 30 degrees, an
integral angle of the hexagon.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.610 align:middle line:84%
The building effectively
expresses the relationship

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.340 align:middle line:84%
between the pentagram
and the hexagram,

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:15.540 align:middle line:84%
or in mathematical
terms, the ratio 5 to 6.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Half a world away to
the east, the same ratio

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.310 align:middle line:84%
is expressed in the
perimeter of the temple

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:90%
complex of Angkor Wat.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.590 align:middle line:84%
The name is a
corruption of Angkhora,

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.580 align:middle line:90%
meaning Horus lives eternally.

Incidentally, the position of
temples within Angkor Wat are

constellation Draco as it

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:41.130 align:middle line:10%

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Further west still, the same
ratio is found in the Andes

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.340 align:middle line:84%
in the perimeter of one
of the oldest temples

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:90%
in the world, Pumapunku.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.770 align:middle line:90%


00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Why is this ratio so
prevalent in temple design?

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.210 align:middle line:84%
If you measure the time it takes
the Earth to complete a full

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:84%
circle around its
axis, 25,920 years,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and the time it takes the
equator to complete its tilt,

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.720 align:middle line:90%
21,600 years--

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.920 align:middle line:84%
divide the two and you
get a ratio of 5 to 6.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So the design of
the Bent Pyramid

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.320 align:middle line:84%
illustrates the motion of the
planet upon which it stands,

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.390 align:middle line:84%
which brings up
an awkward point.

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:34.070 align:middle line:84%
One would need to be around for
26,000 years just to observe

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and measure the phenomenon,
making the 36,000-year Egyptian

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.405 align:middle line:84%
dynasty not so far
fetched after all.

00:38:40.405 --> 00:38:44.340 align:middle line:90%


00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.330 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
end of the story.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The combination of the
pentagram and hexagram

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:51.460 align:middle line:84%
is also the foundation
of the human body,

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.510 align:middle line:84%
since the structure of
chemical bonds that make up DNA

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is arranged in these
two geometries.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.730 align:middle line:10%
Thus, the Bent Pyramid
is both a mirror

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:03.020 align:middle line:10%
of the planet and
those born there.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:10%
We are meant to believe the
two monuments at Dahshur

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.790 align:middle line:10%
plus the third at Meidum
were built by Pharaoh

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.430 align:middle line:10%
Sneferu as mausoleums.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But why would one
man with one body

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.460 align:middle line:84%
require three places in
which to bury himself?

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:84%
In the end, he wasn't
buried in any of them.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.150 align:middle line:84%
This preposterous idea
is based on graffiti

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.390 align:middle line:84%
found on the corners of
the pyramids of Dahshur.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.780 align:middle line:84%
These buildings belong
to Sneferu, it says.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.260 align:middle line:90%
That much is true.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Because when Sneferu was ruler,
he owned all the buildings

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:90%
in his kingdom.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Upon his death, ownership
transferred to the next pharaoh,

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.120 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.240 align:middle line:84%
What is certain is that
Sneferu built a simple chapel

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.090 align:middle line:84%
on the east side of
the Bent Pyramid.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And the king's seal is also
found in the lower chamber,

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:56.730 align:middle line:84%
on stones of rough
quality that were

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.340 align:middle line:84%
used to repair damage
probably inflicted

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.640 align:middle line:84%
by the violent earthquakes that
frequently occur on the fault

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:84%
line upon which
the pyramids stand.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It seems this pharaoh, like
others before and after,

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.830 align:middle line:84%
took pride in restoring
and maintaining

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.815 align:middle line:84%
the houses of the gods that
he inherited from a time

00:40:14.815 --> 00:40:15.615 align:middle line:90%
long before.

00:40:15.615 --> 00:40:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:22.830 align:middle line:84%
If we accept that Yunu and the
Giza pyramids are terrestrial

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:27.420 align:middle line:84%
markers of Sirius and
Orion in 10,450 BC,

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and the Sphinx sees its own
image in Leo at the same time,

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:35.010 align:middle line:84%
it follows that the two Dahshur
pyramids occupy the cluster

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:39.060 align:middle line:84%
of stars in the constellation
Taurus, known as the Hyades,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.090 align:middle line:84%
with the Red Pyramid
appropriately marking the giant

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.660 align:middle line:90%
red star Aldebaran.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.150 align:middle line:84%
In which case, the
pyramid of Meidum

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.370 align:middle line:84%
and its adjacent
monuments to the south

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:54.300 align:middle line:84%
are the terrestrial
reference to the Pleiades.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.580 align:middle line:84%
What exists along this
region of the Nile

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.300 align:middle line:84%
is nothing less than an
engineered landscape created

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.210 align:middle line:84%
by ancient architects
and astronomers.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.430 align:middle line:90%
But to what end?

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:18.229 align:middle line:90%


00:41:18.229 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> To understand the reasoning
behind the superhuman effort,

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:26.090 align:middle line:90%
we begin with local tradition.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.100 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptians
and Arab historians

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:31.400 align:middle line:84%
believed the pyramids were
built by an antediluvian pharaoh

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.130 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Sūrīd ibn Salhouk,

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.610 align:middle line:84%
following a prophetic vision in
which the Earth was turned over

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.240 align:middle line:84%
by falling stars and
massive chunks of rock.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.090 align:middle line:84%
The account is uncannily
similar to the events that

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:48.140 align:middle line:84%
led to the end of the
Ice Age, in 9703 BC,

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.810 align:middle line:90%
and retold the world over.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians calculated
the date as 9600 BC,

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.320 align:middle line:84%
as did the Maya in
Central America.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And in both accounts,
groups of surviving gods

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:04.320 align:middle line:84%
arrived from drowned lands by
boat to restart civilization.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.670 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Sūrīd assembled 130
astronomers, chief

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:84%
among them being Djehuty,
the god of wisdom.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
They calculated that the
event would occur in 300 years

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and overwhelm the
Earth with a flood.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Djehuty recommended that
an unbreakable repository

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.470 align:middle line:84%
be built, inside which every
book related to knowledge,

00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:31.910 align:middle line:84%
astronomy, geometry, physics,
the use of precious stones,

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:84%
even certain types of
machinery would be preserved.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Sūrīd agreed, and ordered
the building of pyramids.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the
Quran identifies Djehuty

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.370 align:middle line:84%
as Idris, of whom it says
was not a name but a title.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Djehuty was its first bearer
who lived before the flood.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:84%
He wrote many books
whose wisdom he

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:84%
preserved on the walls
of the Egyptian temples

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.050 align:middle line:90%
lest it be lost.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.845 align:middle line:84%
It was he who
constructed the pyramids.

00:42:59.845 --> 00:43:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.600 align:middle line:10%
In the ninth century, the story
reached the ears of Caliph

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.230 align:middle line:10%
al-Ma'mun, Governor of Cairo,
and inspired him to find

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.690 align:middle line:10%
a building referred
to as inventory,

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:17.290 align:middle line:10%
where such books and maps had
been stored along with glass

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:21.460 align:middle line:10%
that could be folded, and
metal that did not rust.

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.310 align:middle line:84%
One reputed location
was at Yunu.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:27.880 align:middle line:84%
The other was in the great
pyramid, for the obvious reason

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that it was built to withstand
tidal waves, and earthquakes,

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.440 align:middle line:90%
and meteorites.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not clear if
al-Ma'mun succeeded,

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:39.390 align:middle line:84%
but his effort to break into the
sealed pyramid is there to be

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:40.190 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And soon after, maps showing
parts of the world not seen

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.650 align:middle line:84%
since the flood,
including Antarctica,

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:53.000 align:middle line:84%
free of ice in 22,000 BC,
began circulating around

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.570 align:middle line:90%
the Mediterranean.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible
Djehuty constructed

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.090 align:middle line:90%
another secure vault--

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.945 align:middle line:84%
one less conspicuous
than a pyramid?

00:44:01.945 --> 00:44:09.010 align:middle line:90%


00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Eight miles Southeast of Giza,
the barren panorama looks very

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.820 align:middle line:84%
much like it did 12,000 years
ago after a catastrophe reshaped

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.090 align:middle line:90%
the landscape.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Just beyond the temple
complex of Saqqara

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.660 align:middle line:84%
lies a lone wolf, an anomalous
underground vault hacked out

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:29.380 align:middle line:84%
of swelling clay and limestone
with an uncharacteristic absence

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of finesse, as though
the builders were

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.200 align:middle line:90%
in a race against time.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The serapeum was excavated
by Mariette in 1851.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.700 align:middle line:84%
It yielded hundreds of
discarded items covering

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:45.340 align:middle line:84%
many historical periods,
along with statuettes

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.100 align:middle line:84%
of Apis bulls in niches
near the entrance,

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.380 align:middle line:84%
leading to the assumption
that the complex must

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:54.850 align:middle line:84%
have served as a mausoleum
for sacred bulls.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:84%
To his credit, Mariette did
find several wooden coffins

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.870 align:middle line:84%
containing a disordered
mass of broken bulls' bones,

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:04.400 align:middle line:90%
but no mummified carcasses.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Even the Frenchman commented on
how the burials were about as

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.670 align:middle line:90%
shoddy as it gets.

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:90%


00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Inside the tunnels
near the entrance,

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Mariette found two granite boxes
resembling standard sarcophagi,

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.510 align:middle line:84%
believed to have been lodged
when the new vaults were

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.380 align:middle line:90%
added after 1400 BC.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:28.070 align:middle line:10%
Inside an undecorated tunnel,
he found a small, lavish coffin

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:30.680 align:middle line:10%
containing the
only human burial--

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:36.860 align:middle line:10%
that of Khaemweset in 1213 BC,
a high priest of Ptah, and son

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:10%
of Pharaoh Ramesses II--

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:43.130 align:middle line:10%
a totally inappropriate burial
for a man of his position.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Even common laborers would
be honored with more dignity

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.485 align:middle line:90%
in terms of simple decor.

00:45:47.485 --> 00:45:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Khaemweset was a passionate
restorer of monuments

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.640 align:middle line:90%
already ancient by his time.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps it was his wish to
be buried in humility in a vault

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:01.160 align:middle line:90%
he himself added.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Past the newer sections
is the original tunnel.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And here, things take a
sudden turn for the dramatic.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Nestled inside each vault rests
a basalt or black granite box

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
of preposterous size,
weighing up to 64 tons.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Each box is meticulously
cut, although machined

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:24.680 align:middle line:90%
would be more accurate.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.610 align:middle line:84%
The tolerance is less
than 100th of an inch.

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And each 20 ton lid is
airtight and watertight.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:38.500 align:middle line:84%
But no mummified bulls were
ever found inside them.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Only three of 24 original boxes
are etched with hieroglyphs.

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:46.750 align:middle line:84%
One set appears on a precisely
engineered block of diorite, one

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:48.390 align:middle line:90%
of the hardest rocks on Earth.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:56.010 align:middle line:84%
The marks are crude, rough,
and uneven, hacked as though

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:57.900 align:middle line:90%
with a blunt instrument.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, thousands of years
separate the inscriptions

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.930 align:middle line:84%
from the box, demonstrating
how people in later times

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.890 align:middle line:84%
appropriated and reused
items from an earlier age.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Even the art of
moving massive slabs

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:20.910 align:middle line:84%
proved challenging in 530
BC, when Cambyses I attempted

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:24.480 align:middle line:84%
to negotiate a smaller box
of inferior gray granite

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.540 align:middle line:84%
in a tunnel only
to get it stuck.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:31.580 align:middle line:84%
What was going on in
the original serapeum?

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.320 align:middle line:84%
Could this have been the
room called inventory?

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.490 align:middle line:90%


00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's seen
the lavish burials

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.210 align:middle line:84%
in the Valley of
the Kings and Queens

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:43.520 align:middle line:84%
knows just how the dead
were treated on the journey

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.560 align:middle line:90%
to the afterlife.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Those tombs are works of art,
with the deeds of the pharaoh

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and platitudes to the gods
depicted with great artistry.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:57.200 align:middle line:84%
In sharp contrast, the
hastily carved serapeum

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.530 align:middle line:84%
suggests people working against
the clock for whom finesse

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and decoration were irrelevant.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:07.910 align:middle line:84%
An abandoned lid gives the
impression of an impending event

00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:12.140 align:middle line:84%
about to interrupt
the work in progress.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.080 align:middle line:84%
The overall impression
is of a storage facility

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.810 align:middle line:84%
protecting a cargo of
considerable importance

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.450 align:middle line:90%
inside watertight boxes.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And what could be more important
than documents acquired

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.105 align:middle line:90%
over thousands of years?

00:48:25.105 --> 00:48:28.100 align:middle line:90%


00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.520 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, how does one
locate an underground repository

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:84%
in a landscape transfigured
beyond recognition

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:35.605 align:middle line:90%
by a wall of water?

00:48:35.605 --> 00:48:39.350 align:middle line:90%


00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Assuming the pyramids
of Giza and Dahshur

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:45.800 align:middle line:84%
were built before the event,
they present two advantages.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Being as tall as skyscrapers,
they make excellent landmarks.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And their orientation
to true north

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.050 align:middle line:84%
are ideal tools for
astronomers and surveyors.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:02.550 align:middle line:84%
The Edfu building texts
state that, after the flood,

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:05.640 align:middle line:84%
the followers of Horus wandered
the ocean before making

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.050 align:middle line:90%
their way back to Egypt.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Among them were the
builder gods, some of whom

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:16.150 align:middle line:84%
were specialists in the art
of surveying and astronomy.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.910 align:middle line:10%
50 years after the flood,
a surveyor standing

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:21.700 align:middle line:10%
on the high ground in front
of the middle pyramid of Giza

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.550 align:middle line:10%
would have looked at the sudden
sky on the winter solstice

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.680 align:middle line:10%
and seen the Southern
Cross standing

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:32.290 align:middle line:10%
upright above the serapeum,
like an X marking the spot.

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Had he fallen asleep, he would
have noted the bright star

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Ankaa, the Phoenix,
rising with its parent

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.710 align:middle line:84%
constellation above the
serapeum before sunrise--

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.930 align:middle line:84%
a potent symbol
for people who were

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:48.250 align:middle line:84%
experts in the use of
analogy and metaphor.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, in the
south, a second surveyor

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:53.200 align:middle line:84%
standing at the Bent
Pyramid and looking north

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.740 align:middle line:84%
would have observed the
nearest to the pole star, Vega,

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.060 align:middle line:84%
at zero degrees
above the serapeum.

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:04.300 align:middle line:84%
As dawn approached, busy hands
would have cleared the original

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.690 align:middle line:84%
entrance of mud to find it
had been previously aligned

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:14.470 align:middle line:84%
to the rising sun on the
winter solstice in 19,650 BC.

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:18.580 align:middle line:84%
If so, the followers of Horus
recover their precious cargo

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and return to the ambitious
program of rebuilding

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:23.740 align:middle line:90%
the former world of the gods.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.580 align:middle line:10%
And that involved returning
to the eight original mounds

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.790 align:middle line:10%
to repair the foundations
that, in time, became

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:32.265 align:middle line:10%
the temples we see today.

00:50:32.265 --> 00:50:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:10%
One such mound is to be
found 700 miles downriver

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:43.380 align:middle line:10%
across the ancient city of
Waset, later known as Thebes.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:49.660 align:middle line:90%


00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Like Yunu, Djamet is a
place of deep antiquity

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.010 align:middle line:84%
with cultural ties to
the forces of creation.

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Today it goes by the
name Medinet Habu,

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:04.600 align:middle line:84%
a site rarely visited on
the west bank of Luxor.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.270 align:middle line:84%
It has seen a long
history of habitation,

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:10.120 align:middle line:84%
yet the focus of attention
is the imposing temple

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.005 align:middle line:84%
of Ramesses III, which is built
on a scale far more suited

00:51:14.005 --> 00:51:14.805 align:middle line:90%
to giants.

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:19.540 align:middle line:90%


00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Barely 3,000 years old, the
temple encompasses a time

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:26.830 align:middle line:84%
of social and economic turmoil,
evidenced by the protective wall

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:29.955 align:middle line:84%
that turned the once divine
environment into a fortress.

00:51:29.955 --> 00:51:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's an absence
of mysticism here.

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:40.660 align:middle line:84%
The building is a testament
to the projection of ego.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.030 align:middle line:84%
The sacred art and
purpose of the temple

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:46.930 align:middle line:84%
has been overtaken by the need
to project kingly strength.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Thus, in place of
philosophical concepts,

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:54.160 align:middle line:84%
we find murals depicting the
defeat of the pharaoh's enemies.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Such late monuments sacrificed
geometry and purity for bombast,

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and a beauty that is
comparatively superficial.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Political instability
led to hieroglyphs

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:09.100 align:middle line:84%
being recarved by later rulers
taking credit for former glories

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.680 align:middle line:90%
while changing the storyline.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, hieroglyphs
were hammered 8 inches deep

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.370 align:middle line:84%
to prevent your story from
being erased and rewritten

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:20.260 align:middle line:90%
by the next guy.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.875 align:middle line:84%
The effect is as
brash as it is brutal.

00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Unlike its predecessors,
Ramesses' monument

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:32.630 align:middle line:84%
also neglects an essential
temple protocol, the alignment

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:35.780 align:middle line:90%
to a celestial object.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.970 align:middle line:84%
As such, it is
disconnected from the world

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.220 align:middle line:90%
of the gods and their magic.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just a lifeless pile
of stone, a larger than life

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.490 align:middle line:84%
building best known
for its color frescoes

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that at least helped
us appreciate just how

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Egyptian temples once looked.

00:52:50.620 --> 00:53:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.210 align:middle line:84%
A central tenet of
mysteries teachings

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:35.900 align:middle line:84%
is not to be fooled by what is
big, and shiny, and beautiful,

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and distracts the eye from
things of deeper meaning.

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And this test is certainly
at play in old Djamet.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.130 align:middle line:10%
Because the awakened
visitor is undistracted

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:48.320 align:middle line:10%
by the big monument,
and is instead

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.420 align:middle line:10%
attracted to a humble
temple beside the entrance.

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.510 align:middle line:10%
The first indication that
something of great value is here

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:59.330 align:middle line:10%
is the axis that
deviates significantly

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.550 align:middle line:10%
from that of Ramesses'
building, and points

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:06.440 align:middle line:10%
to something far more
ancient along the horizon.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.390 align:middle line:84%
On this sacred mound of
the followers of Horus,

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:13.190 align:middle line:84%
once reached by boat, there
have stood consecutive temples

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:16.720 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to Amun, the
one who conceals himself.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:20.210 align:middle line:90%


00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:23.060 align:middle line:84%
The present building has
been systematically renovated

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:28.440 align:middle line:84%
since 2100 BC by enlightened
pharaohs such as Amenhotep I,

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Hatshepsut, and Thutmoses III.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.470 align:middle line:90%


00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:37.520 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to ignore the feeling
of raw power and deep antiquity

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.130 align:middle line:84%
beneath the feet,
while observing images

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:42.530 align:middle line:90%
honoring the creator god.

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Ramesses most likely
built his monument

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:47.540 align:middle line:84%
to associate himself
with this humble building

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and its connection with
the image of our moon.

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Because Egyptians in
his time were still

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:56.090 align:middle line:84%
undertaking pilgrimage here,
just as their ancestors

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.460 align:middle line:84%
did in remote
antiquity, as though

00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.995 align:middle line:90%
obeying some genetic memory.

00:54:59.995 --> 00:55:04.220 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And probably so, because
beneath the foundations

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.700 align:middle line:84%
are buried the eight
primeval gods and goddesses

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.000 align:middle line:84%
of ancient Egypt, meaning
that their remains would

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.670 align:middle line:84%
have been brought here
by the followers of Horus

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:84%
from the island of
ancestors, Eutiti,

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:22.250 align:middle line:84%
the domain of the
gods they abandoned

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.710 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the Ice Age.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:29.250 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.500 align:middle line:10%
The followers of Horus,
who were intimately

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.620 align:middle line:10%
associated with Orion,
memorialized the event

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:37.620 align:middle line:10%
by aligning the axis
of this temple of Amun

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.990 align:middle line:10%
with the first appearance
of the constellation

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:46.710 align:middle line:10%
above the horizon on the
winter solstice of 8000 BC.

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And from here they would leave
their mark along a 700-mile

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:54.480 align:middle line:84%
stretch of the terrestrial
Milky Way, the River Nile.
