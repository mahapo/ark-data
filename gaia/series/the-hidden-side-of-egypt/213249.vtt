00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:90%
of its monuments.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Among them are Karnak and
Luxor as well as Djemet,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.455 align:middle line:84%
where eight of the
original gods are buried.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Many more remain hidden
under sand or silt,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:84%
awaiting their turn
to be resurrected.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a similar situation as
far as people are concerned.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Much of their potential lies
dormant until something awakens

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
within that transforms
them into the man

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.675 align:middle line:90%

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Like most esoteric
cultures, Egyptians

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:84%
regarded the
incarnation of the soul

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
into the body as
a spiritual death.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.126 align:middle line:84%
And they went to great lengths
to remedy the situation.

Dehenet, abode of the
goddess Meretseger,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:90%
she who loves silence.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And in two valleys below,
many kings and queens

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.855 align:middle line:84%
found this epitaph to be true
when they were laid to rest.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Unlike pyramids, the valleys
of the kings and queens

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
are the places to
find buried royalty.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.530 align:middle line:10%

But at the extreme end of
the Valley of the Kings,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.646 align:middle line:90%
one tomb deviates from the rest.

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:10%
Sat in a narrow crevasse 80
feet above the desert floor,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:10%
the alleged resting
place of Tutmosis III

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:10%
was found sealed along
with its sarcophagus.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
When it was opened, there was
nobody inside nor would there

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:84%
have been because
Tutmosis was buried

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
mountain in the mortuary temple

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
beside that of his
stepmother, Hatshepsut.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.405 align:middle line:84%
So what on Earth
is going on here?

00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:05.085 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:84%
To the Egyptians, a
tomb was a place of rest

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily a
final resting place.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
In much the same manner,
experiencing the Amduat

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:84%
did not require a
person to be dead.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, evidence
shows that after undergoing

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.110 align:middle line:84%
an initiation ritual inside
the restricted chamber,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
candidates were roused
several days later

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.195 align:middle line:84%
from a wound-like experience
and proclaimed awoken or arisen.

00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Tutmosis' monument is
different in every sense.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.700 align:middle line:84%
It features a well, a redundant
feature for a dead person.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
The first chamber forms
the bridge into the Amduat.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Despite Tutmosis' extraordinary
accomplishments, none of them

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:90%
are listed.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the room displays the
book of the hidden chamber,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
a complete set of 741
protective deities,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.480 align:middle line:84%
spells, and incantations
necessary for the initiate

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to access the Amduat
and maintain focus

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:90%
to ensure his return.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
The Amduat was as real to
Egyptians as the physical world.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But unlike the physical
world, this parallel place

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:90%
exists outside of time.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:84%
It is present and eternal and
simultaneous with the physical.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:10%
It interpenetrates the
world of the living, a place

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:10%
from where all
physical forms manifest

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:10%
and to where they return.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
It is an integral component
of birth, death, and rebirth.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:84%
The book claims that only
through a direct experience

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
of the Amduat can one fully
grasp the operative forces

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
of nature, the
knowledge of which

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:84%
is said to transform a person
into an akh, a being radiant

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
with inner spiritual
illumination.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the physical
body operates

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
at a very dense
vibration, the process

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
also involves techniques
to guide more penetrating

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, slowly raising
the body's vibration

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and preparing it for the
ultimate out-of-body experience

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
from which the individual was
expected to return and live

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:90%
a fully active life.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.355 align:middle line:84%
And Tutmosis III
did exactly that.

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
The lower chamber is also shaped
unlike a regular burial chamber.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.110 align:middle line:84%
It is in the elongated
shape of a cartouche,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.746 align:middle line:90%
symbolizing eternity.

00:06:49.746 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The sarcophagus is a
scaled version of the room.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And whereas the west is
the ritual orientation

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
for the dead, this room
is aligned northeast,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
symbolic of the quest
for knowledge and wisdom.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Whoever lay here did not
come looking for death.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.250 align:middle line:84%
They came in search
of illumination.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
The book of the hidden
chamber rolls out

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.175 align:middle line:90%
like a papyrus around the room.

00:07:37.175 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Although painted in a simplistic
and uncharacteristic style

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.700 align:middle line:84%
for a ruler of
this magnitude, it

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is expertly executed, providing
a highly descriptive account

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
of the journey of the
initiate aboard a solar boat

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:84%
across the Milky Way, the
obstacles and challenges facing

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
the soul as it navigates
the unusual landscape,

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and the assistance it would
receive to reach its intended

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
destination.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
However, the text claims
the experience is not

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:84%
intended for a dead person
but one who is alive.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It is good for the dead
to have this knowledge

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
but also for the
person on Earth.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Whoever understands
these mysterious images

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
is a well provided light being.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Always, this person can
enter and leave the Amduat,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
always speaking to
the living ones proven

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.935 align:middle line:90%
to be true a million times.

00:08:31.935 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, Tutmosis
and perhaps others

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:84%
used a chamber to
access the shadow world

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and return with specialized
information, which

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.980 align:middle line:84%
was then practically
applied in daily life.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the ritual was not
limited to people of high rank.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:90%

to a servant in the
household of Pharaoh Teti

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I describes how he
was favored to join

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
a privileged inner
circle via secret ritual

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:84%
to master the secret
things of the pharaoh.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:84%
The humble man states, today in
the presence of Teti, son of Ra,

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
more honored by the pharaoh
than any servant, master

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.520 align:middle line:90%
of secret things.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%
When his majesty
favored me, he caused

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that I enter the chamber
of restricted access.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And upon returning
from his experience,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:84%
the grateful servant joyfully
proclaims, I found the way.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But the big question
is, If this ritual

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.070 align:middle line:84%
had been performed
a million times,

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:84%
just how far back
does the tradition go?

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Was this another of the
pieces of temple protocol

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:84%
introduced by the Aku Shemsu
Hor, the shining ones,

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.055 align:middle line:90%
followers of Horus?

00:09:52.055 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Illumination may have
inspired the creation

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of a sprawling complex on
the east side of the Nile

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Karnak.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Karnak expanded like a
living entity from a seed

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:84%
into a rambling metropolis,
where anybody who was anyone

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:84%
left a shrine, a pillar, an
obelisk, even an entire temple.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Karnak is creation in a
permanent state of creation.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
The name translates as stone
sanctuary of the illuminated

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.970 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:84%
50 feet of silt and
accumulated rubble

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
beneath the present buildings
make it impossible to date.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:10%
However, its only surviving
megalithic structure,

ostensibly the oldest, is a
sun shrine along the main axis,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:10%

winter solstice and the minor

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:10%
lunar standstill
around 4,400 BC,

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.320 align:middle line:10%
just as the age of Taurus
was reaching its climax.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.230 align:middle line:84%
The simple yet robust shrine
appears to have been rededicated

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and reused 3,000 years later
by our old friend Tutmosis III.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But the founding of Karnak may
lie deeper still in antiquity.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Its most ruined section
falls under the protection

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:84%
of the original
prehistoric god Montu,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.400 align:middle line:90%
ostensibly making it the oldest.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Montu is the universe defined,
the creative principle

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.840 align:middle line:90%
manifested as time and space.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Such a fundamental
understanding of how

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:84%
life evolves would have been
a staple teaching of the Aku

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Shemsu Hor.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, the general
alignment of Montu's precinct

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.310 align:middle line:84%
is similar to that between
the Temple of Edfu and Orion.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The movement from one age to
the next brings new ideals.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:84%
The old causeway into Karnak is
lined with an Avenue of Rams,

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
marking the passage
into the age of Aries.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Around this time,
Montu's position

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:84%
was superseded by
three gods, defining

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:90%
the eternal cycle of creation--

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Amun, his consort Mut, and
their divine child Khonsu.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.060 align:middle line:84%
A shrine of dedication
to this trinity

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
marks the entrance, illustrating
how the cult of Amun

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.000 align:middle line:84%
not only dominated
this epoch, it even

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
led to the rewriting
of earlier narratives.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, near the destroyed
chapel of Tutankhamun,

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:84%
a pillar celebrating
the coronation of Seti

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I shows the pharaoh
honoring Amun on the right,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.600 align:middle line:84%
except Amun's image is
set deeper into the stone.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.780 align:middle line:90%
The pillar has been recarved.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Tutankhamun himself did
not escape the purge.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.316 align:middle line:84%
He was forced to change his
original name, Tutankhaten.

00:13:24.316 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Never one to be
outshone, Rameses II

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:84%
enlarged the great
court to make way

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:84%
for two rows of
statues of himself,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.270 align:middle line:90%
of which only three remain.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:84%
At least he was thoughtful
enough to add an effigy

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:84%
of his wife, even
if a small one.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.410 align:middle line:84%
A vast field of debris
surrounds Karnak.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:02.420 align:middle line:84%
It is an invitation to study
the art of the stonemason.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
The fine detail on a basket
or the skin of a serpent

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.800 align:middle line:84%
can be appreciated now they're
no longer on a lintel 30 feet

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:90%

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.440 align:middle line:84%

pharaohs being granted

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.765 align:middle line:84%

the small chapel of Senusret

And no wonder.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
The proportions of
this delicate gem

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.785 align:middle line:84%

of the Earth, moon, and sky.

3,500 years later, it is

The transportation of
such massive needles

once taxed the extremes

the energy emitted
from this sacred place

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%

The experiment effectively

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.940 align:middle line:84%
However, the combination
of focused group prayer

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
in the temple created an
expanded consciousness field

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that yielded even
higher results.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
such places generate

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
conditions that induce an
elevated state of awareness.

Luxor was allowed
to fall into decay.

Its connection to the Nile
was gradually severed.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And as a village sprouted within

Amenhotep was a kind

He began to remove the power

the elegant Seshat, goddess of

wisdom, two original Akhu Shemsu

Hor, who, according to
the Edfu building texts,

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.810 align:middle line:84%
were the only divine
beings who knew

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
how the temples and sacred
places were created,

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:84%
for they were the very
creators of that knowledge.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.660 align:middle line:84%
The building texts also
refer to the temple

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:90%
as an insurance policy.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
"Whoever shall make a copy of

physical body that

00:39:37.745 --> 00:39:41.770 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But Saqqara was not intended
solely as a funerary complex.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.920 align:middle line:90%


00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.920 align:middle line:84%
As we have discovered,
there is physical death

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.530 align:middle line:90%
and metaphoric death.

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids such as
those attributed

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.060 align:middle line:84%
to Sekhemkhet and
Teti, which were

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:03.580 align:middle line:84%
found sealed with nobody
inside, are examples of this.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And not forgetting the pyramid
of Unas, which illustrates

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:11.710 align:middle line:84%
the lengths to which people went
to seek the Amduat while alive,

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:17.430 align:middle line:84%
because Unas himself is buried
in the Valley of the Kings.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.500 align:middle line:10%
To reach this
pyramid, it required

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:10%
crossing the Nile towards
the setting equinox sun,

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.400 align:middle line:10%
disembarking at a
pier and walking along

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:10%
a half-mile long
umbilical tunnel,

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.525 align:middle line:10%
leading to a series of
subterranean preparatory rooms.

00:40:32.525 --> 00:40:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.250 align:middle line:84%
When finally
entering the pyramid,

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:43.940 align:middle line:84%
you came face to face with
walls covered in the pyramid

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.510 align:middle line:84%
texts, the earliest
sacred literature offering

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:50.630 align:middle line:84%
a unique window into a
ritual connecting a living

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:90%
person with the Amduat.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:55.250 align:middle line:90%


00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Like a veil
separating two worlds,

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.970 align:middle line:84%
they are meticulously incised
into semitranslucent walls

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.330 align:middle line:90%
of alabaster.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
283 instructions offered
detailed descriptions

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:84%
of the Amduat, how to get there,
how to overcome negative forces,

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and the correct use of
spells essential for the soul

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to maintain focus and
find its way back.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But above all, the pyramid
texts implied they were intended

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:29.020 align:middle line:84%
for someone who was expected
to return to a living body,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:34.540 align:middle line:84%
as Unas himself declares, "I am
the one who went and came back

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.785 align:middle line:90%
and shines anew in the east."

00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:39.300 align:middle line:90%


00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:84%
The text closest to the
sarcophagus reiterates this.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.760 align:middle line:84%
"Unas, you have
not departed dead.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:50.010 align:middle line:84%
You have departed alive to
sit upon the throne of Osiris,

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.845 align:middle line:84%
your scepter in your hand
that you may give orders

00:41:52.845 --> 00:41:53.645 align:middle line:90%
to the living."

00:41:53.645 --> 00:41:57.800 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.620 align:middle line:84%
One section describes
Unas's eating habits,

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:04.340 align:middle line:84%
which is very odd because a
dead or dying person doesn't

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.290 align:middle line:90%
have an appetite.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.480 align:middle line:84%
"Unas eats their magic
and ingest their spirits.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Their big ones are
for his morning meal.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Their midsized ones are
for his evening meal.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Their little ones are
for his nightly meal."

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.080 align:middle line:84%
The description refers to the
initiate gradually ingesting

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.160 align:middle line:84%
a poison or powerful narcotic,
such as blue water lily,

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.090 align:middle line:84%
prior to undertaking an
out-of-body excursion.

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:35.600 align:middle line:84%
2,000 years later, Western
religion referred to this

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.770 align:middle line:90%
as the Last Supper.

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:42.050 align:middle line:84%
In another section,
Unas undergoes

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:45.380 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual purification
and rebirth to the repeated

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.150 align:middle line:90%
chorus of "Unas is not dead.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Unas is not dead," preceded
by the return to the pyramid.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.910 align:middle line:84%
No other passage so
encapsulates the central theme

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.980 align:middle line:84%
common to this
esoteric tradition,

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that the soul is capable
of temporarily disengaging

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.000 align:middle line:84%
from the physical body,
journeying independently

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.530 align:middle line:84%
into the spirit
world and returning.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.120 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But it is the massive stone
box that speaks volumes.

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.950 align:middle line:84%
The deliberate choice
of basalt, a rock

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:22.970 align:middle line:84%
that begins life in liquid form,
epitomizes the transmutation

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:26.030 align:middle line:84%
between physical
and ethereal states.

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:29.120 align:middle line:84%
While its black color,
[EGYPTIAN LANGUAGE] in Egyptian,

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.780 align:middle line:84%
means to imagine,
to discover, sums up

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.390 align:middle line:84%
the intent behind
Unas's journey,

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:37.370 align:middle line:84%
one that would be
repeated a thousand

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:39.230 align:middle line:90%
years later by Tuthmosis III.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.912 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.912 --> 00:43:45.860 align:middle line:84%
To the modern eye, the colossal
effort behind this complex

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.510 align:middle line:90%
seems over the top.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet practitioners
of this art

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.980 align:middle line:84%
gained a profound
understanding of the universe

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.205 align:middle line:84%
as it is rather
than how it appears.

00:43:54.205 --> 00:43:57.050 align:middle line:90%


00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Take Rekhmire, the vizier during
the reign of Tuthmosis III,

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:05.090 align:middle line:84%
a man cognizant of the
mechanics of initiation,

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.600 align:middle line:84%
one of whom it was claimed,
"There is nothing on Earth

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.160 align:middle line:84%
in heaven or in any part of the
Amduat in which he does not have

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.380 align:middle line:90%
knowledge."

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:19.430 align:middle line:84%
And judging by the title he
was awarded, master of secrets

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:24.160 align:middle line:84%
concerning the unique seeing
vision, the effort was worth it.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.300 align:middle line:90%


00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:84%
All this takes place just
beyond Saqqara's main compound,

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.450 align:middle line:84%
which is secluded
from the mundane world

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:38.280 align:middle line:84%
by a perimeter wall that
resembles a row of spirit doors.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.500 align:middle line:84%
One doesn't just casually
stroll into this sacred space.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.160 align:middle line:84%
One must first undergo
a purification.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Or as the pyramid text put it,
"Learn to master oneself before

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.750 align:middle line:90%
entering the abode of the god."

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And the preparatory
corridor into Saqqara

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.750 align:middle line:84%
is designed exactly
for this purpose.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:90%


00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.420 align:middle line:84%
40 pillars formed by
bundles of 17 reeds,

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.820 align:middle line:84%
each representing
the way of the gods,

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:17.730 align:middle line:84%
marked the passage from
the known into the unknown.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.970 align:middle line:84%
The walk is all
about mindfulness.

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Since the abode of the god
mimics a state of balance,

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.370 align:middle line:84%
negative thoughts
and emotions must

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.680 align:middle line:84%
be discarded
beforehand so as not

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.280 align:middle line:84%
to pollute the delicate
environment within.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.850 align:middle line:10%
To achieve this, an alcove
separating each pillar

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:40.000 align:middle line:10%
emits a positive or
negative current.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.460 align:middle line:10%
As these pass through
the body, a person

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.810 align:middle line:10%
becomes conscious of imbalances
and disposes any excess baggage

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.970 align:middle line:10%
they might be carrying.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Reaching the end
in a unified state,

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the person passes through a
gateway in the shape of a T,

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.420 align:middle line:84%
representing the
breath of god and is

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.500 align:middle line:90%
ushered into the great court.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.874 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:46:04.874 --> 00:46:10.180 align:middle line:90%


00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.820 align:middle line:84%
One square mile of
buildings enclosed

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.710 align:middle line:84%
within a perimeter in
the ratio of the octave

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:20.220 align:middle line:90%
make this an imposing space.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.830 align:middle line:10%
During the 13th year
of the pharaoh's reign,

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:10%
the court hosted the
Heb-Sed festival,

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.700 align:middle line:10%
in which the pharaoh was
publicly disrobed down to a mere

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.950 align:middle line:10%
white apron to
cover his modesty,

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.100 align:middle line:10%
whereupon he ran
the perimeter twice.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And if successful, he was
declared reborn in heaven

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and deemed too fit to
govern for another term.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.740 align:middle line:90%


00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.800 align:middle line:84%
That was the public
stage of the festival.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The ruler was then taken to
the restricted Heb-Sed Court

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.700 align:middle line:90%
for a private ceremony.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Each shrine contains a
statue of a god representing

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.340 align:middle line:84%
an aspect of the
mysteries, reminding

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.920 align:middle line:84%
the pharaoh of the
teachings that were his duty

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.510 align:middle line:90%
to exemplify and uphold.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Once the circuit
was completed, he

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.770 align:middle line:84%
disappeared into a
restricted chamber

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and reappeared three days
later to be declared living.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:16.595 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:16.595 --> 00:47:22.420 align:middle line:90%


00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.840 align:middle line:84%
The focal point of Saqqara
is the imposing Step Pyramid.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.630 align:middle line:90%


00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Like an act of creation,
it grew in stages

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:34.360 align:middle line:84%
from a small,
rectangular mastaba,

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:90%
whose creator remains unknown.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.640 align:middle line:84%
The fifth and final
stage is attributed

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to the architect Imhotep,
whose positive contributions

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:48.480 align:middle line:84%
to society earned him
the status of god.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Officially, the pyramid
was designed as the burial

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.530 align:middle line:90%
place of Pharaoh Djoser.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But since it incorporates four
buildings far older than Djoser,

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.570 align:middle line:90%
this theory is a nonstarter.

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Inside a deep shaft,
his alleged sarcophagus

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:07.095 align:middle line:84%
contained no
hieroglyphs and no body.

00:48:07.095 --> 00:48:10.490 align:middle line:90%


00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:12.620 align:middle line:84%
The adjacent tunnels,
on the other hand,

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:16.520 align:middle line:84%
were lined with thousands of
turquoise rectangles and packed

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.700 align:middle line:84%
with 33,000 alabaster
jars and plates,

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.450 align:middle line:84%
many preceding the
pharaoh's time.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:26.120 align:middle line:84%
One wonders why robbers
would steal a corpse

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.290 align:middle line:84%
and leave their
valuables behind.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.690 align:middle line:84%
More stone boxes lie
throughout Saqqara,

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:36.440 align:middle line:84%
and shafts sunk 120
feet into solid bedrock

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and connected to a
warren of tunnels.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Largely unexplored,
this underground world

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.320 align:middle line:84%
is highly suggestive
of people protecting

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.530 align:middle line:90%

Ask anyone to share
their initial feelings

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.180 align:middle line:84%
about each pyramid,
and they will give you

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.045 align:middle line:84%
different responses, despite
the fact the buildings all

00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:21.845 align:middle line:90%
look the same.

00:49:21.845 --> 00:49:25.510 align:middle line:90%


00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But appearances
can be deceptive.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there are
subtleties between each one.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.130 align:middle line:84%
The impressions fall
into distinct categories.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.290 align:middle line:84%
The small pyramid
has the intensity

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:40.570 align:middle line:84%
of people engaged

and lacks the
spiritual element that

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:10%
only seems to occur in
the Great Pyramid, the one

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.990 align:middle line:10%
singularly associated
with shamanic experiences

00:49:56.990 --> 00:50:00.190 align:middle line:10%
and the supernatural.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:02.230 align:middle line:84%

The pyramid
attributed to Menkaure

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:19.030 align:middle line:84%
bears a large gash, courtesy
of Sultan Al-Aziz Uthman,

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:24.490 align:middle line:84%
who embarked on a futile mission
to dismantle all the pyramids.

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:28.150 align:middle line:84%
A second attempt was made in the

Vyse, who delicately made his
way through using gunpowder.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.710 align:middle line:84%
The smooth upper
limestone casing

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:41.770 align:middle line:84%
was looted, leaving the
lower third of red granite

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.980 align:middle line:84%
to show the true
age of the building.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Deep, rounded cavities
between the rocks

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:53.110 align:middle line:84%
attest to thousands of years
of water exploiting the seams.

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:57.550 align:middle line:84%
Then, for reasons unknown,
someone in recent times

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.460 align:middle line:84%
recarved a square

Some feature the same enigmatic
knobs found in the Assyrian.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It is an unsolved

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:24.570 align:middle line:84%
as this architectural detail is
found in the Andes, even Taiwan.

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And what connects
all of them are

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:30.180 align:middle line:84%
traditions of a group of
preflood builder gods answering

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to the same physical
description, mannerisms,

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and purpose as the
Akhu Shemsu Hor.

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:41.170 align:middle line:84%
If so, these sages were
not unique to Egypt.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:44.670 align:middle line:84%
They had an international
maritime presence,

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:48.005 align:middle line:84%
a point strongly implied
in the Edfu building texts.

00:51:48.005 --> 00:51:54.280 align:middle line:90%


00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.440 align:middle line:84%
One characteristic
of the interior

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:00.220 align:middle line:84%
is the extensive use of
high-grade granite, particularly

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.250 align:middle line:84%
the monoliths used for the
ceiling of the main chamber,

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.710 align:middle line:84%
which are carved
as a barrel vault

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
to relieve nonexistent pressure
from the ceiling above,

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.270 align:middle line:84%
because the chamber
sits inside the bedrock.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:15.000 align:middle line:90%


00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.240 align:middle line:84%
It is also a mystery as to
how the blocks were maneuvered

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:24.120 align:middle line:84%
inside a confined space with
virtually no room for maneuver.

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.540 align:middle line:84%
This particular granite is
composed of feldspar, quartz,

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and mica, making it an
extremely hard material

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:34.170 align:middle line:84%
to work with under
any circumstances.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's the high
content of mica

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that is of interest, a
material generally used

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:43.620 align:middle line:84%
as an electrical
insulator and capacitor.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Was Menkaure ever connected
with this pyramid?

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:51.810 align:middle line:84%
A delicately carved blue
basalt box and its broken lid

00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:53.310 align:middle line:90%
were found empty.

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:56.040 align:middle line:84%
In the adjacent chamber
lay bits of bones

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and an anthropoid
wooden coffin, allegedly

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:01.440 align:middle line:84%
bearing Menkaure's
name, but it turned out

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:05.710 align:middle line:84%
to be a later
Christian invention.

00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:08.290 align:middle line:84%
While the true architect
remains elusive,

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:13.010 align:middle line:84%
the pyramid does serve an
important geodetic function.

the oldest monuments on Earth,

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:29.235 align:middle line:84%
Portasar, better known by its
new Turkish name Gobekli Tepe.

Portasar is an Armenian

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:43.540 align:middle line:84%

Next door stands
Khafre's pyramid.

The only connection between
the pyramid and the pharaoh

are the statues found buried in

600 yards away.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Rumor has it that
the building began

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to be stripped by
Rameses II for a temple

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.760 align:middle line:84%
he commissioned for
himself in nearby Iwnw.

it was good enough for others

The bedrock at each corner was
shaved until perfectly level.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:26.150 align:middle line:84%

carved into the steps

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.270 align:middle line:84%

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:12.000 align:middle line:84%

of a large chamber.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.330 align:middle line:10%
Below this cavity lies
the Grand Gallery,

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:20.280 align:middle line:10%
a steep 157-foot-long granite

its measurements

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:10.310 align:middle line:10%
The fourth hour from "The
Book of the Hidden Chamber"

00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:15.020 align:middle line:10%
describes, "The great one who is
in the Amduat moving to the land

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:18.920 align:middle line:10%
of Rosetau, the
place of hauling.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The place of hauling is
an integral component

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.100 align:middle line:84%
in the act of rejuvenation
and is illustrated

00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:29.840 align:middle line:84%
as a series of sloping passages
and doors resembling those

00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:33.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Grand Gallery, right
down to the megalithic granite

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.335 align:middle line:90%
plugs that form its roof.

00:58:35.335 --> 00:58:38.570 align:middle line:90%


00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:42.260 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, rejuvenation
was a lunar concept.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And we see this represented by
the connecting Queen's Chamber,

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:49.880 align:middle line:84%
a room made of limestone,
a material created

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.840 align:middle line:84%
by the sedimentary action of
water, which, of course, comes

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.890 align:middle line:90%
under the influence of the moon.

00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:59.152 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:58:59.152 --> 00:59:01.950 align:middle line:90%


00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Its complementary opposite
is the King's Chamber,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.440 align:middle line:84%
with its finely fitted
and polished granite

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:11.250 align:middle line:84%
blocks, born of volcanic
action, representative

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:14.190 align:middle line:90%
of the solar principle.

00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:16.290 align:middle line:10%
Like the human
heart, the chamber

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:20.280 align:middle line:10%
is placed to the left of
the spine of the pyramid.

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:22.500 align:middle line:84%
The nine blocks
forming the ceiling

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.330 align:middle line:84%
reflect the esoteric
number of perfection.

00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:27.920 align:middle line:90%


00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:32.960 align:middle line:84%
The granite box is a
scaled-down version of the room.

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.020 align:middle line:84%
All this makes for one
of the most fine-tuned,

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:40.010 align:middle line:84%
resonant chambers on the planet,
where words are fragmented,

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:44.840 align:middle line:84%
and sound becomes
the main currency.

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, archaeoacoustic
experiments

00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:52.100 align:middle line:84%
revealed an average resonant
frequency of 110 hertz,

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.760 align:middle line:84%
a frequency within a narrow
range that shifts activity

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.270 align:middle line:84%
from the information processing
left hemisphere of the brain

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to the right hemisphere
and its capacity

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.800 align:middle line:84%
to induce sensing
and altered states.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.460 align:middle line:84%
The same frequency is produced
in chambers from Malta

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to England and Ireland,
places with long traditions

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.230 align:middle line:84%
of altered states and
associations with gods.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:19.790 align:middle line:90%


01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Could this austere
room be the place

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:26.030 align:middle line:84%
where the seeker is transformed
into an ark, a being radiant

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.640 align:middle line:90%
with inner illumination?

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, it is one
location on Giza Plateau

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:36.290 align:middle line:84%
where visions and out-of-body
states are experienced.

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And viewed as a whole,
the passages linking

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.470 align:middle line:84%
through the Great Pyramid
follow an allegorical journey

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.730 align:middle line:90%
of elevation.

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
Beginning in the rough stone
chamber inside the bedrock,

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:50.930 align:middle line:84%
the space and quality
improves as one ascends closer

01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:54.650 align:middle line:84%
to the chamber made of the
highest polished stone.

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.260 align:middle line:84%
The building, it
seems, is a metaphor

01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
of the initiate reshaped
from rough stone

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.670 align:middle line:84%
into polished
diamond into a god.

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:09.200 align:middle line:90%


01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Which leaves us with a
connection between the three

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
pyramids and the
belt stars of Orion.

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it a mere visual
interpretation of the sky?

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.780 align:middle line:90%
Or is there a deeper meaning?

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.530 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:25.290 align:middle line:84%
The unlikely answer
comes from Easter Island,

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
where a tribe named Waitaha
lived there 12,000 years ago

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and interacted with gods
answering to the same physical

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:37.170 align:middle line:84%
description and doctrine
as the Akhu Shemsu Hor.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Or as they were known throughout
the Pacific, Urukehu and shining

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:44.240 align:middle line:90%
ones.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Like their Egyptian
counterparts,

01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
they, too, were
associated with Orion.

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
According to the three
wisdom houses of Waitaha,

01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
each star is linked to a group
of gods and their qualities.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Star Mintaka represents the
leaders, thinkers, and planners.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Its mirror is the
Pyramid of Menkaure,

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.820 align:middle line:84%
with its impression of people
engaged in mental activity.

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Star Alnilam is for
investigators, researchers,

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and builders.

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Its mirror is the
Pyramid of Khafre

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:21.040 align:middle line:84%
and its impressions
of practicality.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And star Alnitak, the knowledge
keepers, shamans, and dreamers,

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
its mirror is the
Pyramid of Khufu

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.806 align:middle line:84%
with its unparalleled record
of shamanic experiences.

01:02:31.806 --> 01:02:36.300 align:middle line:90%


01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The Waitaha's unique
tradition finally

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
provides us with the purpose
behind each monument.

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:45.200 align:middle line:84%
As to how the
buildings were used,

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
that recipe is lost to time.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.160 align:middle line:84%
But at a few who've
entered the King's Chamber

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and left the body
for parts unknown,

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the answer lies with something
called sympathetic resonance.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.330 align:middle line:84%
The Waitaha's direct interaction
with the followers of Horus

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
began in the same period when
these traveling seafaring

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
gods were establishing the eight
sacred mounds along the Nile.

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And their experience is shared
by two other ancient peoples,

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
the Aymara of South
America and the Maya.

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that the sign
of an advanced civilization

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
lies in its ability
to communicate

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.910 align:middle line:84%
multiple levels of information
through simple symbols.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
The same can be said of the
monuments of ancient Egypt,

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:48.047 align:middle line:84%
designed as they are as
multilayered conduits

01:03:48.047 --> 01:03:49.130 align:middle line:90%
of knowledge and function.

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:51.950 align:middle line:90%


01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Speaking through them,
the Akhu Shemsu Hor

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:58.970 align:middle line:84%
laid a foundation for a
rejuvenated, ideal world,

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
designed to last like
the soul into eternity.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:09.720 align:middle line:84%
The principle is conveyed in a
simple symbol, the union of a T,

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:15.390 align:middle line:84%
the Tao, the breath of god
with the form of infinity,

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
the eternal breath of
creation, life everlasting.

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And their vision is
a reminder that we

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
are an expression of that
breath, the very gods we've

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:30.300 align:middle line:90%
been searching for.
