gods, the ram-headed Khnum,
protector of the waters

that sustained this land.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Khnum's assigned
duty was the creation

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.820 align:middle line:84%
of humans whom he made from
clay on a potter's wheel.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And since he also
molded deities,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
he was known as
the divine potter

P-aaleq was known as the
Island of the time of Ra.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And given that the reign of
Ra took place in 39,000 BC,

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.965 align:middle line:84%
it makes P-aaleq the

Like the act of creation
itself, one temple died

But just as P-aaleq was
being consumed by the rising

of the higher self.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
The right corridor belongs to
his complementary opposite,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
the crocodile god, Sobek,
the shadow self who

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.275 align:middle line:90%
dwells in the night hours.

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the
entrance one felt

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
attracted to, the initiate would
work on all aspects of the light

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.920 align:middle line:84%
or shadow of personality,
harmonize the two,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.435 align:middle line:90%
and restored balance within.

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, Kom
Ombo was the place

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
where you mastered
the art of duality.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And to achieve this, you
needed to conquer fear.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Egyptians dramatized a spiritual
concept with a passion play

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:84%
where Horus was devoured
after sunset by Sobek.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:10%
However, as sunrise
approached, Sobek

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:10%
was responsible for
the rebirth of Horus,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:10%
thus ensuring their
mutual survival.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Because without death, there is
no rebirth, there is no death.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And for this reason,
the crocodile

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.940 align:middle line:90%
was both feared and revered.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.985 align:middle line:84%
All this took place inside an
enclosed series of chambers.

00:12:31.985 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:84%
At the end of each
passage stands

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.150 align:middle line:90%
a highly magnetic altar stone.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:84%
One is angled to project
the magnetic field upward,

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
the other downward,
creating a loop.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.680 align:middle line:84%
At this point in
the proceedings,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.870 align:middle line:84%
initiates who had
mastered duality

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
were tested by being led into a
lower chamber in which they had

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:84%
to prove their control
of fear, which they did

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
by swimming with a crocodile and
pinning an earring to its ear.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And just to prove the
priests had a sense of humor,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
they omitted to tell
the candidates they'd

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
given the reptile a
sedative to buy them

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:84%
enough time to
complete the task.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:10%
The teaching of the two doors
also known as the Book of Gates

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.550 align:middle line:10%
was practiced half a
world away in the oldest

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.155 align:middle line:10%
section of Machu Picchu.

00:13:33.155 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Inside a cleft cut into the
rock stand two false doors

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:90%
that lead nowhere.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, the angle of
the stone above this chamber

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:84%
is identical to that
used for the entrance

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:90%
into the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.290 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:84%
In Greek times, the two
gates became the doors

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of truth and falsehood,
an important component

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Mystery
School of Zeno, which

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.269 align:middle line:84%
the Greek philosopher learned
while studying in Egypt.

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:10.692 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:10.692 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:84%
The path of initiation
continued downriver

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.455 align:middle line:84%
to one of two original
prehistoric mounds of Horus.

00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Little remains of
Nekhen but rubble.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:84%
However, the second red
mound survives 9 miles away.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.460 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the
most dramatic sites

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.428 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt, the Temple of Edfu.

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:57.921 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Representing the Shining
Ones, followers of Horus, Edfu

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:84%
is the home of the
hawk god Horus,

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.390 align:middle line:84%
the one who overcomes the
challenges posed by a journey

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to the underworld to emerge
purified and spiritualized,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.835 align:middle line:90%
a self-made solar hero.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
With its face to
the equator, Edfu

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.100 align:middle line:84%
is designed to stoke the
inner fire that gives strength

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:90%
to complete the journey of life.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Egyptians stated
how a temple is not

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
a fully sacred space until it
stands upon the foundations

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.760 align:middle line:90%
of 12 earlier sites.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Edfu fulfills that
requirement, resting

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
as it does upon multiple
foundations covered by thousands

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:84%
of years of Nile silt while
incorporating elements

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:84%
from earlier buildings in
the fabric of the structure

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:90%
we see today.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:10%
Embracing this remote antiquity,
the axis of Edfu marks Orion

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:10%
in its midheaven position on the
summer solstice in 10,500 BC.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:84%
At a stroke, it acknowledges
the constellation

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
followers of Horus,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
as well as the highest
position of light,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.460 align:middle line:84%
the mark of the solar hero
and the triumph of wisdom

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.660 align:middle line:90%
over ignorance.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:84%
But above all,
the date coincides

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:84%
with that anomalous agricultural
revolution on the Nile.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:10%
Still, Edfu did not
escape the decay that

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.760 align:middle line:10%
comes with the mortal world.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.505 align:middle line:84%
A mud brick village sprouted
inside the compound.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:48.750 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:10%
30 feet of accumulated
rubbish and sand

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:10%
raise the rubble
up to its ceiling,

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.155 align:middle line:10%
nearly overwhelming the site.

00:16:55.155 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:84%
French visitors in the 18th
century describe villagers

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
living on the roof and
discarding garbage,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:84%
a sight that led the novelist
Gustave Flaubert to remark,

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:84%
"the village is situated around
the enormous temple and climbs

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:90%
up part of it.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.125 align:middle line:84%
The temple serves as a public
lavatory for the whole village."

00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Towards the end of
the 19th century,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:84%
the site was finally
cleared of debris.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:84%
To access the interior,
French archeologists

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
had to be lowered through
a hole in the roof

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and dig their way through
a thousand years of sewage

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:90%
and household waste.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.780 align:middle line:84%
The English writer
Amelia Edwards

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
describes the
transformation, "now

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.100 align:middle line:84%
standing free in
a deep open space

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
like a risen god
issuing from a grave,

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
the huge building
stands before us

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
in the sunshine,
erect and perfect.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
The effect at first
sight is overwhelming."

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Who enters that gate crosses the
threshold of the past and leaves

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:90%
2,000 years behind him.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Edfu was restored
by Greek pharaohs

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:84%
with images of Ptolemy
III dominating its facade.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.225 align:middle line:90%
But this is only half the story.

00:18:19.225 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:90%


00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Appropriating other people's
buildings was commonplace.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, at Abusir, there
is a graffito written thousands

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
of years earlier than
the building later

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.260 align:middle line:90%
claimed by pharaoh Sahure.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Still, there is
some truth to this.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Under Alexander the Great, the
Greeks found Edfu in tatters

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:90%
and proceeded to restore it.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, the buildup of
waste after their departure

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.125 align:middle line:90%
helped preserve their hard work.

00:18:52.125 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:10%
The imposing entrance
leads to a central court.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Just as in Philae, it is framed
by 32 columns once covered

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
in secret teachings,
transforming the initiate

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
as the 33rd Degree as they
entered the body of a god given

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.235 align:middle line:90%
visible shape in stone.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
The temple also
served as a reminder

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:84%
to the pilgrim of the
importance of honoring

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.920 align:middle line:84%
the physical gods who brought
civilization to the land,

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
gods in spirit form

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:84%
who are intertwined
with and regulate

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.920 align:middle line:90%
the proper flow of nature.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Thus, in the first
hall, 12 columns

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.240 align:middle line:84%
represent the hours of
daylight and the qualities

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:90%
of the gods assigned to each.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.370 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:47.370 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:90%
The kiosk served as a library.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The kind of card index
listing available books

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:90%
is marked on the wall.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:84%
It seems Plato is late
returning his copy, accounting

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:90%
for inflation that'll cost him.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The following haul,
by contrast, is

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.445 align:middle line:84%
devoted to the 12 hours of
night and their assigned gods.

00:20:33.445 --> 00:20:36.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The stone still bears
the scars of creosote

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:84%
from the campfires of
villagers who lived here.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:84%
At the core of the temple,
the sanctuary stands alone.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It is both a mound of creation
as well as the original island

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.035 align:middle line:90%
domicile of Horus himself.

00:20:56.035 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The walls outline the
qualities of this god.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.550 align:middle line:84%
As a metaphor, the falcon
hovers above the Earth.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:84%
It is no longer limited to what
is near but sees beyond cause

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and effect to take
in the big picture

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.035 align:middle line:90%
and its limitless horizon.

00:21:14.035 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.910 align:middle line:10%
At the rear stands
an imposing altar

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.700 align:middle line:10%
shaped from a single
block of syenite

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:10%
and polished to perfection.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:10%
It once contained a
gold statue of the god.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
But the focal point is
the solar barque of Horus.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
It once housed stone
tablets inscribed

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.420 align:middle line:84%
with the deeds and
qualities of the solar hero,

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:84%
whose conduct set the tone
for moral and civic order.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.510 align:middle line:84%
In essence, this
receptacle is a precursor

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.665 align:middle line:90%
to the Ark of the Covenant.

00:21:49.665 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.060 align:middle line:84%
A serpent curves along
the mask of Horus,

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
indicating the use of life
force to amplify and sustain

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.590 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual force.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Each year, the barque was
navigated down river to Luxor

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
for a festival marking the union
with Horus's consort, Hathor,

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
whose own barque arrived
from Dendera in celebration

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:90%
of the abundance of the land.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:84%
During restoration
work, Greek scholars

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.470 align:middle line:84%
came across something
of far greater value

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
among the rubble of
Edfu, the building texts.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:84%
The building texts
describe a remote period

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
in prehistoric times called
the early primeval age

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, in which the
ancestors of the Egyptians

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
arrived from the island of fire
that lay amid the great ocean

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.615 align:middle line:84%
to the South, where the
earliest mansions of the gods

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:47.415 align:middle line:90%
were founded.

00:22:47.415 --> 00:22:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:84%
This sacred domain was the
abode of the followers of Horus.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And on occasion, the gods
would take a lucky human there

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:90%
to see it.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.720 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
The Edfu building texts state
that during this period,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:84%
there existed two
races: hunter-gatherers

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.540 align:middle line:84%
with little knowledge
of civilization,

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and an all together
different race of people

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.790 align:middle line:84%
who lived remotely,
far more advanced

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
in engineering,
metallurgy, astronomy,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.800 align:middle line:84%
large-scale architecture,
natural magic, civic cohesion,

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:90%
and navigation.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.500 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
When a swarm of meteorites
caused havoc across the globe

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and ushered the Ice
Age in 10,800 BC,

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.000 align:middle line:84%
it forced a group of sages to
search for a potential new home

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.870 align:middle line:84%
to set up the sacred mounds upon
which the future temples would

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:84%
be built. Within 300 years, the
group of male and female gods

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:84%
established themselves
along the Nile,

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.260 align:middle line:84%
governing from Yunu and
other satellite temples,

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:90%
and Edfu was one of them.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But soon, this golden
age of creation

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
was overrun by a second
catastrophe, a meteorite

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and a flood destroyed
the island of fire.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.730 align:middle line:84%
The calamity is described as
the great leaping snake pierced

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
the domain of the
gods, the majority

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:84%
of its divine
inhabitants drowned.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Companies of gods lucky
enough to be at sea survived.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Led by Horus and Djehuty, the
seven sages and builder gods

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
reluctantly wandered the world
as the crew of the falcon before

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.830 align:middle line:84%
arriving in Southern
Egypt, in their words,

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
"to resurrect the former
world of the gods."

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:84%
The decision to
rebuild here was due

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:84%
to its geographical advantage in
a period marked by extreme cold

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.190 align:middle line:90%
and the absence of sunlight.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Close to the equator, conditions
were warmer and humid.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And the extra rainfall benefited
the region as an ideal place

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
for the regeneration
of new forms of life.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:90%


00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Described as very tall,
elegant, and possessing

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
supernatural powers,
the followers of Horus

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.140 align:middle line:90%
were experts in their field.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:10%
They constructed
sacred architecture

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:10%
according to what the
sages of the primeval age

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:10%
revealed to Djehuty.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
They possessed the ability
to foretell the future,

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:30.080 align:middle line:84%
endue with power the substances
on Earth to magnify things

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.320 align:middle line:84%
and provide magical
protection by means of symbols

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.625 align:middle line:90%
and the giving of names.

00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:84%
This dynasty of
semi-divine beings

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
governed Egypt until
they found humans

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.950 align:middle line:84%
with integrity who were
capable of leading by example.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:51.173 align:middle line:84%
At which point, the followers
of Horus lived in the shadows.

00:25:51.173 --> 00:25:54.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:54.610 --> 00:26:00.520 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.710 align:middle line:84%
To read the walls
of Edfu is to dive

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
into a lost history
of the human race,

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.795 align:middle line:84%
a time when we walked side
by side in mutual respect

00:26:08.795 --> 00:26:09.595 align:middle line:90%
with gods.

00:26:09.595 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:90%


00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet the building texts are
scattered from wall to pillar,

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:20.380 align:middle line:84%
indicating they are part of
a broader account recovered

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:84%
in fragments by
Greek renovators who

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.630 align:middle line:84%
carve the information on
every available space,

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:90%
lest it be lost.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.000 align:middle line:84%
After all, the texts state
how they comprise nothing

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:84%
less than the
words of the sages,

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.770 align:middle line:84%
the only divine
beings who knew how

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.215 align:middle line:84%
the temples and sacred
places were created.

00:26:38.215 --> 00:26:40.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, one distinguishing
characteristic of all the flood

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
gods was their knowledge
of the laws of nature

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:90%
and how to bend them.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Demonstrating the point,
along the inner perimeter,

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:84%
there is a recipe for
transforming an ordinary piece

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.134 align:middle line:90%
of land into a portal.

00:26:58.134 --> 00:27:01.452 align:middle line:90%

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:84%
The manipulation of the
subtle forces of nature

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.000 align:middle line:90%
occurs at Edfu itself.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's telluric currents
flow across the planet

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.660 align:middle line:90%
in many forms.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:84%
One covered the
surface like a net.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Known as the Hartmann Grid,
this rectangular membrane

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.040 align:middle line:84%
stretches around the
perimeter of Edfu

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
as though establishing
a protective force

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.656 align:middle line:90%
field for the sacred mound.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:54.280 align:middle line:90%


00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.980 align:middle line:84%
The bloodline of the followers
of Horus was maintained

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.640 align:middle line:84%
for 6,000 years after
the flood, until Menes,

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:84%
who roasted a throne in 3200
BC, who is ascribed as the first

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:10.310 align:middle line:84%
pharaoh of a purely
human bloodline.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Still, by 1500 BC, their
progeny occasionally

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
found their place on the
throne, such as Hatshepsut,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:84%
the queen depicted
with the beard,

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:26.310 align:middle line:84%
but not because she was
pretending to be a man.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
The ceremonial beard
identifies the ruler

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.590 align:middle line:84%
as the wisdom-keeper
while acknowledging

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:35.610 align:middle line:84%
their divine lineage, although
the symbol was often misused

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
by anyone claiming instant
godliness by association.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Hatshepsut left a few clues
about her special lineage.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.460 align:middle line:84%
For starters, she rebuilt
the Temple of Amun

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:84%
at Djanet, where the original
creator gods are buried.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Then in her own temple, a
delicate set of frescoes

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.310 align:middle line:84%
depict her alleged
voyage to a land

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:84%
called Punt, a nickname
given to the island

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.570 align:middle line:84%
from which the followers
of Horus originated.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.180 align:middle line:84%
However, this journey
would have been impossible

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.180 align:middle line:84%
in the queen's time because
the island of the gods

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
is said to have been overwhelmed
by a falling meteor and rising

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.830 align:middle line:90%
seas long before her time.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The account is retold
in Papyrus 1118

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.980 align:middle line:84%
by a sailor who was
shipwrecked there and met

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:84%
one of the surviving
gods shortly before it

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.865 align:middle line:90%
vanished beneath the waves.

00:29:32.865 --> 00:29:36.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Like the sailor,
Hatshepsut's journey

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:84%
takes her into the
Indian Ocean to a land

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.775 align:middle line:84%
of beehive huts, special trees,
precious goods, and incense.

00:29:45.775 --> 00:29:49.260 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.590 align:middle line:84%
It may have been her subtle way
of advertising her connection

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:56.280 align:middle line:84%
to the bloodline,
especially as the next mural

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.910 align:middle line:84%
describes the divine principle
incarnating in mankind

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.880 align:middle line:84%
whose earthly representative
is Hatshepsut.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:10%
The queen's temple
appears deceptively simple

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.380 align:middle line:10%
but is, in fact,
full of surprises.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.100 align:middle line:10%
In contrast with the funerary
function of the adjacent valleys

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.470 align:middle line:10%
of the kings and
queens, her temple

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:26.940 align:middle line:10%
stands out in its
dedication to fertility.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:31.140 align:middle line:10%
Partly integrated into the
cliff face and partly inside it,

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.880 align:middle line:10%
it expresses an act
of impregnation.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:10%
The effect is dramatized by
directing the axis of the temple

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.190 align:middle line:10%
to the rising
winter solstice sun

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:10%
so that the first
shaft of light is

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.910 align:middle line:10%
conducted along a series of
ramps into an altar at the top.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:90%


00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Before the desert took over,
the approach to the temple

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.260 align:middle line:84%
was made along an avenue of
Sphinx, reflective pools,

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and flower beds.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Rows of 11 columns define
this as a solar temple,

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Three ascending levels symbolize
the trinity of creation

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual aspiration
of the individual.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.740 align:middle line:84%
With its rigidity and
absence of adornment,

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.370 align:middle line:84%
the design projects
strength and masculinity.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.790 align:middle line:10%
It is sober, symbolic,

His exercise in geomancy
influenced architects

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.920 align:middle line:10%

Albert Speer in Germany during

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.725 align:middle line:10%
the 1930s and the

At the head of each ramp
stands a protective falcon,

who is artfully integrated
into the balustrade as two

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.710 align:middle line:84%
intertwined serpents,

focused through a series of
narrow doorways each carved

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.160 align:middle line:10%

the stone symbolizing

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.280 align:middle line:10%
the solar masculine

On the middle level lies
the Chapel of Hathor,

the House of Horus.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:17.090 align:middle line:84%
The chapel also pays tribute to
the ancient festival of Adhir,

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.780 align:middle line:84%
which remembers the great flood
generated by the Taurid meteor

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Anubis is the opener of
the way, the black dog who

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.090 align:middle line:84%
uses his homing

own masterpiece 50 feet above
the original level of the Nile,

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.925 align:middle line:84%

Earthquakes, war,

Seti was a student of

Ramesses spent much of his life
removing invaders from Egypt,

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:84%
or engaging in war
with its enemies,

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.160 align:middle line:84%

Ramesses boasted no
less than 103 children.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:84%

The modern restoration has

through his understanding of
the knowledge of the gods.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And having applied it
in his words and deeds,

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:29.160 align:middle line:84%
he was reborn just

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But Seti's vision went beyond
leaving a record of his journey

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:90%
into enlightenment.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.470 align:middle line:84%

seven individual sanctuaries.

in need of finessing
or addressing.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And by implementing new
ideas in their daily habits,

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.340 align:middle line:84%
they gradually improved

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.450 align:middle line:84%
The name Osiris is a
Greek transliteration,

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:15.610 align:middle line:84%
his original name was Asar, from
which derives the title vizier,

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.170 align:middle line:90%
and later, wizard.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.770 align:middle line:90%


00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:84%
One panel depicts
the passage of Osiris

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.855 align:middle line:84%
into the underworld
aboard a sailor boat.

00:40:25.855 --> 00:40:31.390 align:middle line:90%


00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:34.690 align:middle line:84%
While overhead, his
cartouche carries his name

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:84%
across the starry sky
and into eternity.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.440 align:middle line:84%
In one striking scene, he is
administering to the djed pillar

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:90%
with his consort, Isis.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.570 align:middle line:84%
The djed is said to represent
the stability of life.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.330 align:middle line:84%
So it is interesting
that it should

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
be inclined at 22 degrees,
the minimum angle of tilt

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, whose movement
generates the seasons

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.215 align:middle line:84%
and allows the planet
to sustain life.

00:41:01.215 --> 00:41:07.810 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.850 align:middle line:84%
All forms and
functions of this god

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:84%
are represented here, along
with ceremonies related

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.190 align:middle line:84%
to his journey
into the underworld

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.228 align:middle line:90%
and his subsequent resurrection.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.480 align:middle line:84%
The next chapel focuses on
the qualities of Amun-Ra,

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.670 align:middle line:84%
in which the knowledge
of the creator god

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:37.080 align:middle line:84%
is transmitted to Seti by
the use of a kamsar, a hand

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.490 align:middle line:84%
gesture aimed at the third eye
creating a bridge from one being

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.860 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Seti declares he has a
clear conscience when

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.380 align:middle line:84%
applying this restricted
information which

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.925 align:middle line:90%
he will protect at all costs.

00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:56.650 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Throughout his
initiatory journey,

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Seti has shown making
offerings to Isis,

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.880 align:middle line:84%
who in turn nurtures
him with her wisdom

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:90%
by breastfeeding the pharaoh.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, a young
Seti takes his position

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:14.080 align:middle line:84%
on her lap as Horus, the child
reborn through divine knowledge.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.030 align:middle line:84%
In the Chapel of
Ra-Horakhty, the candidate

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:26.090 align:middle line:84%
seeks illumination
during the daylight hours

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:29.540 align:middle line:84%
as he follows the path of the
rising sun towards sunset.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Finding himself in
a state of balance,

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.140 align:middle line:84%
the candidate is
now in a position

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.960 align:middle line:84%
to manifest on the
physical plane.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And for this to occur,
there is no better teacher

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.462 align:middle line:84%
than the great
architect himself, Ptah.

At the height of
his accomplishment,

00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Seti is given his own chapel in
which he is honored by Djehuty

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.460 align:middle line:90%
for using his wisdom wisely.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And by Seshat, goddess
of sacred buildings

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.880 align:middle line:84%
who writes his name into
immortality for constructing

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.890 align:middle line:84%
a temple according
to the protocol

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.620 align:middle line:84%
set down by the
followers of Horus.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Or did he?

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:25.680 align:middle line:84%
By far, the most potent
room is the Holy of Holies.

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.160 align:middle line:84%
There is a powerful yet
humbling presence here,

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.520 align:middle line:84%
the combination of Earth
energy and thousand years

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.024 align:middle line:90%

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.220 align:middle line:84%
The problem is,
the room is located

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.270 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong part of the
building according to protocol,

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.180 align:middle line:84%
the temple ought to
represent a bodily form

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.060 align:middle line:90%
from feet to the head.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Technically, the Holy of Holies
should extend beyond the Osiris

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.690 align:middle line:90%
room, but it doesn't.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:10%
Seti abruptly changed
the axis of the temple,

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.975 align:middle line:10%
and the building took on the
shape of an L, a total violation

00:44:06.975 --> 00:44:07.775 align:middle line:10%
of protocol.

00:44:07.775 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:90%


00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Seti was an astute
student of temple culture.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Only an unforeseen
structural issue

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:20.040 align:middle line:84%
would have forced such a
radical departure from normal.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.170 align:middle line:84%
The answer to his
apparent madness

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:84%
lies beyond the rear wall
of the Osiris chapel.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:90%


00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The area behind
Seti's temple looks

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:37.770 align:middle line:84%
much like it did a century ago
when the depression in the sand

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:42.210 align:middle line:84%
inspired a large
digging operation.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.420 align:middle line:10%
As the debris was removed,
it revealed a building so out

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.720 align:middle line:10%
of place that people wondered
what it was doing there.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.570 align:middle line:84%
The Osireion is categorically
different from anything

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:01.575 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egypt.

00:45:01.575 --> 00:45:08.060 align:middle line:90%


00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.670 align:middle line:84%
At first glance, it appears
to be an underground temple.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But close inspection reveals
a building overwhelmed by silt

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:84%
deposited during a long
period of intense flooding

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and rainfall, a period
that lasted up to 7,000 BC.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:34.000 align:middle line:84%
This alone makes the
Osireion 9,000 years old.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.430 align:middle line:84%
In contrast to
Seti's ornate temple,

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:40.180 align:middle line:84%
it is stark and minimalist,
constructed with the biggest

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:42.820 align:middle line:90%
blocks of stone in Egypt.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.810 align:middle line:84%
At 100 tons apiece, one
wonders how early navigators

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:50.740 align:middle line:84%
were able to ship them 300
miles from the quarry at Aswan.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:54.400 align:middle line:90%


00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Visually, the Osireion's
closest relative

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:90%
is the Valley Temple at Giza.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And like the Valley, Temple
it too was accessed by boat

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and encircled by the
waters of the Nile.

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:84%
The Osireion is named for
Osiris although this was

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.230 align:middle line:90%
an invention by archeologists.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.900 align:middle line:84%
There is no sign the
god was buried here.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And although many
pharaohs came to Abydos

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to honor him, by 3500 BC
none of their monuments

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.940 align:middle line:84%
related to the Osireion as
though it was already lost

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.305 align:middle line:90%
beneath the silt and the sand.

00:46:29.305 --> 00:46:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:10%
When it was finally excavated,
the formidable architraves

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.810 align:middle line:10%
that once formed the
ceiling were found

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:41.390 align:middle line:10%
cracked and collapsed as though
an enormous weight compromised

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:10%
the integrity of the building.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.700 align:middle line:90%


00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It is possible that
Seti rediscovered the

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.490 align:middle line:84%
by then underground structure
and built his new temple

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:56.410 align:middle line:84%
above it because both
buildings share the same axis.

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:59.440 align:middle line:10%
But the weight of his temple
placed an impossible burden

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.580 align:middle line:10%
on the compromised stone below,
collapsing it and forcing

00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.330 align:middle line:10%
Seti to alter his plan.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Because Seti is
Holy of Holies ought

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.485 align:middle line:90%
to be right above the Osireion.

00:47:10.485 --> 00:47:15.570 align:middle line:90%


00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Seti carved a handful of
hieroglyphs to tell us

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:19.530 align:middle line:90%
he was here.

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.530 align:middle line:10%
Yet judging by the advanced
megalithic architecture,

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.470 align:middle line:10%
he was certainly
not the builder.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Case in point, the
ceremonial tunnel

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Seti attached to the
rear of the Osireion

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.130 align:middle line:90%
is made of crude mudbrick.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.150 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the tunnel
are two important texts.

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.170 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Gates
and the book of what

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:46.020 align:middle line:84%
is in the underworld,
an orientation

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.900 align:middle line:84%
map of the underworld and
what the initiate should

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.190 align:middle line:90%
expect to see there.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:53.210 align:middle line:90%


00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:58.100 align:middle line:84%
A bass relief features the
titles of its gatekeeper Osiris.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.350 align:middle line:84%
This is carved from
inferior limestone

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:04.175 align:middle line:84%
blocks which pale in quality
as one enters the Osireion.

00:48:04.175 --> 00:48:09.820 align:middle line:90%


00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.510 align:middle line:84%
The heart of the Osireion is
a massive sandstone platform

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:17.560 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by an 18-foot deep
moat fed by an underground

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.850 align:middle line:84%
spring, giving the platform
the appearance of an island,

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:25.205 align:middle line:84%
the primordial mound of creation
rising out of the waters

00:48:25.205 --> 00:48:26.005 align:middle line:90%
of chaos.

00:48:26.005 --> 00:48:31.220 align:middle line:90%


00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Two sets of steps are
carved at each end,

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:36.350 align:middle line:90%
providing places to disembark.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:39.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:43.640 align:middle line:84%
There are two recesses in the
center, a square representing

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.360 align:middle line:84%
the physical world, and the
rectangle in the proportion

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:50.570 align:middle line:84%
of the Golden Ratio, the
mathematical progression

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:53.225 align:middle line:84%
at the core of plants,
shells, and animals.

00:48:53.225 --> 00:48:58.270 align:middle line:90%


00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.670 align:middle line:84%
As if continuing the
theme of creation,

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.730 align:middle line:84%
the five flower of
life diagrams painted

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.460 align:middle line:84%
with a mixture of egg
yolk, dissolved limestone,

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and red ocher appear on the
inner face of one monolith.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Their awkward
position near the top

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.220 align:middle line:84%
suggests they were added
much later, possibly

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:22.300 align:middle line:84%
by the Greeks when the site was
still partly exposed but covered

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.430 align:middle line:90%
with rubble.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.962 align:middle line:84%
What is the building
trying to say?

The surrounding wall
of sandstone blocks

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:37.990 align:middle line:90%
contains 17 side chambers.

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:43.670 align:middle line:84%
This unique number
is found in some

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.670 align:middle line:84%
of the oldest temples on
the planet, all of which

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:50.660 align:middle line:84%
are associated with teachings
introduced by antediluvian gods

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and sages who followed
in their footsteps.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.900 align:middle line:90%


00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Called "the way of the gods,"
it is found in other 17 chamber

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:06.785 align:middle line:84%
sites such as Qenko in
Peru and Meath in Ireland.

00:50:06.785 --> 00:50:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.920 align:middle line:84%
If so, then the 17
teachings of the gods

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.350 align:middle line:84%
surround this
island of creation,

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.785 align:middle line:84%
whose 10 massive granite
pillars prop up the sky.

00:50:18.785 --> 00:50:22.000 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.060 align:middle line:84%
The teachings are the means of
connecting to the heavenly world

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:25.860 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.050 align:middle line:84%
The Osireion, it
seems, is nothing less

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:35.260 align:middle line:84%
than an umbilical cord
linking the material world

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.490 align:middle line:90%
to the supernatural.

00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Beyond what was originally
the entrance looking out

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to the Nile, Seti added another
corridor made of limestone.

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:48.150 align:middle line:90%


00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Its gabled ceiling
features the Book of Nut

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:54.150 align:middle line:84%
in which the sky
goddess is supported

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:56.235 align:middle line:90%
by Shu, the god of air.

00:50:56.235 --> 00:50:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:03.310 align:middle line:10%
Its astronomical texts
outline the interrelationship

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.970 align:middle line:10%
between the realm of Earth
and sky overseen by Shu.

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:09.700 align:middle line:90%


00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.100 align:middle line:84%
On the opposite ceiling
is a description

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.210 align:middle line:84%
of the hours of day and
night, its associated gods,

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:19.120 align:middle line:84%
and the interrelationship
with the underworld.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:23.000 align:middle line:90%


00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.830 align:middle line:84%
The Osireion is a great teaching
device depicting in graphic form

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:31.250 align:middle line:84%
the very act of creation
when the knowledge of a god

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:33.680 align:middle line:84%
impregnated the
original mound which

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:35.495 align:middle line:90%
rose above the waters of chaos.

00:51:35.495 --> 00:51:38.840 align:middle line:90%


00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And inside its chambers were
taught the rules of nature

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and how a mortal person
can learn to bend them,

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:49.610 align:middle line:84%
just as ancient Egyptians once
said of the gods themselves.

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:54.030 align:middle line:90%


00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But the act of creation
requires two individuals.

00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps we should be
looking less at Osiris

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.640 align:middle line:90%
and more at his consort, Isis.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And to this effect,
Seti cunningly

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:07.650 align:middle line:84%
left a clue in the
corner of the very

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.309 align:middle line:90%
last room of his own temple.

The whole of Sekir describes
the rebirth of Seti

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.480 align:middle line:84%
with the help of the god
attributed with this function.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.980 align:middle line:84%
The falcon-headed god is shown
standing at the foot of a bier,

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:31.740 align:middle line:84%
while Isis in the
form of a kite hawk

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.930 align:middle line:90%
hovers above a horizontal Seti.

00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:37.040 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.030 align:middle line:84%
As the kite hawk of Osiris,
Isis demonstrates her ability

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:46.550 align:middle line:84%
to fan the breath of immortality
into those entrusted to her.

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:49.040 align:middle line:10%
For this to occur,
the soul of the hero

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.450 align:middle line:10%
must travel to the region of
regeneration, the pole star,

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:58.550 align:middle line:10%
which is protected by 7 akhu,
the seven circumpolar stars that

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:01.760 align:middle line:10%
rotate around it but never set.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Like the soul, they are
the indestructibles.

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And the star Deneb the
constellation of Cygnus

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.690 align:middle line:90%
is one of them.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But long before Cygnus
was depicted as a swan,

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.260 align:middle line:84%
it took on the form
of a kite hawk.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.590 align:middle line:84%
If the constellation could be
associated with the Osireion,

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:27.500 align:middle line:84%
we may yet discover
its true age,

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:32.150 align:middle line:84%
When Seti built his temple,
he violated a second protocol.

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:36.680 align:middle line:84%
It fails to align with
any celestial object.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.845 align:middle line:84%
It does, however, share the
same unusual 36-degree axis with

00:53:40.845 --> 00:53:41.645 align:middle line:90%
the Osireion.

00:53:41.645 --> 00:53:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:47.670 align:middle line:84%
Rolling back the sky,
a person looking out

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.770 align:middle line:84%
the original entrance
of the Osireion

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.200 align:middle line:84%
at the time of its
inauguration would

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.290 align:middle line:84%
have experienced a sight
both magical and theatrical

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:58.380 align:middle line:84%
on the winter solstice
as Cygnus rose

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:03.180 align:middle line:84%
in union along a vertical
river of stars, the Milky Way.

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:07.320 align:middle line:84%
With its bright star, the
indestructible Deneb appearing

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:14.600 align:middle line:84%
through the doorway
in 10,500 BC.

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It seems Seti wasn't
so much concerned

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:middle line:84%
with his own
accomplishment as he

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.820 align:middle line:84%
was with resurrecting a temple
built by the followers of Horus

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.920 align:middle line:84%
to transmit their
knowledge to those

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.080 align:middle line:84%
who had come searching
for it thousands

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.560 align:middle line:90%
of years in the future.
