[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.650 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back, everyone.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.814 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that you
tuned back in tonight.

00:00:20.814 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, in last night's
episode, we learned

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:84%
about a lot of toxicities
that might be compromising

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
your body, making you sick;
a lot of trash that might

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.460 align:middle line:90%
be building up in your body--

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
the vaccines, the GMOs, the
fluoride, the aspartame, and so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:90%
We learned about all that.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, let me ask you a question.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.850 align:middle line:84%
If your toilet was
overflowing in your house,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.739 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know what
to do, don't you?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.155 align:middle line:84%
You call the Roto Rooter
guy and he comes out

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and he unclogs yours pipes.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But how many of
you actually know

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.870 align:middle line:84%
how to get those toxins out of
your body that have accumulated

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:90%
over the years?

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know how to
properly detox your organs so

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:84%
that you can get that
trash out of your system

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and so that you can be healthy
like you were intended to be?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.369 align:middle line:90%
Many of you may not.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm glad
that you tuned in tonight.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.457 align:middle line:84%
This first interview
with Dr. Patrick Quillin

00:01:04.457 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:84%
is going to be some really
amazing information from him.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:10%
I'm so excited to be
able to talk to him

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.790 align:middle line:10%
because he uses the
analogy that detoxification

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.660 align:middle line:10%
is like growing a garden.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:90%
How so, you might ask.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, he says that in order
to grow a garden properly,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:90%
you've got to detoxify the soil.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.060 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get
rid of the sticks,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get
rid of the stones,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:84%
you've got to make
that soil fertile so

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:84%
that the plants can grow the
way that they were intended to.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do the same
thing with your body.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.973 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Dr. Patrick
Quillin shares here with us.

00:01:32.973 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:84%
He says you've got to
detoxify your body so that you

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:84%
can grow and be healthy the
way that you were intended to.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to learn specifics

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.091 align:middle line:84%
in this episode
about how to do that.

00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:43.524 align:middle line:90%
So pull up a chair, stay tuned.

00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
You're going to really
enjoy this information.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.064 align:middle line:84%
First of all, with
Dr. Patrick Quillin.

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I've heard you say that health
is like growing a garden.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:90%
Why do you compare those two?

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if you think about not
everybody in America has access

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:10%
to a garden, but I hope you at
least have some appreciation

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:10%
that I don't care if you live
in Central Park or near Central

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:10%
Park in New York City and
I've been in New York dozens

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:10%
of times And it's a
beautiful, vibrant city but go

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:10%
to the nearest botanical gardens
and have a look at nature

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:10%
and have an appreciation for it
because when you find a patch

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.577 align:middle line:10%
of land and you say, I
want to grow a garden here,

00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:10%
the first thing you're going
to do is take out the weeds

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:10%
and sticks and stones and
detoxify that patch of land.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.422 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with the human body.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
If you find a body that's not
well, all kinds of symptoms,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.440 align:middle line:84%
we mentioned some of the
common killers in America.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And from those symptoms, the
first thing we would do is say,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
we're going to take you just
like that piece of land.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's detoxify first.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's take out the heavy metals,
the volatile organic chemicals.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Studies have been done looking
at Americans where these

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
are legitimate
labs, FDA approved

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
labs that have looked
at urinary output

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:84%
from volatile organic
chemicals, BPA.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Bisphenol A is one that's
commonly found and almost all

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.430 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Flame retardants in
almost all of us.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
You think, well, how
did it get there?

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.720 align:middle line:84%
The fact is many of
us have been exposed

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:84%
to frightening levels of
chemicals that in many cases

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:90%
are hormone disruptors.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:84%
That is, they affect
the ability of the body

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
to make male or female
hormones, insulin.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The many hormones are
now this regulated.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So those chemicals,
the heavy metals,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:90%
the toxic burden in the gut.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Many of us are causing ourselves
what's called autotoxemia.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Auto is self, toxins in the gut.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And now you have yeast, candida
albicans, bacteria, yeast,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
virus, other organisms that
can move into the bloodstream

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.572 align:middle line:84%
and generate autoimmune
diseases, even cancer.

00:03:55.572 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
There is a whole
chapter in my book

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
"Beating Cancer with
Nutrition" that talks about

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:84%
is cancer in some cases
actually an infection?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
fascinating subject.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.816 align:middle line:84%
Back to the business
of what does a garden

00:04:07.816 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:90%
have to do with their body?

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Detoxify it.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So what is detoxification?

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.612 align:middle line:84%
It's heavy metals, it's
parasites, it's pesticides,

00:04:15.612 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
it's all these kinds of
toxins that are in your blood

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:90%
and in your body.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.331 align:middle line:84%
What does that have to do
with the immune system?

00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you remember
in episode two,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the immune
system and the toxicities.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And in this next segment,
Dr. Murray Susser

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:84%
elaborates on the
effect of heavy metals

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
in the immune system,
specifically talking about what

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:90%
is chelation therapy.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The immune system plays
a pivotal role in cancer.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.280 align:middle line:10%
It may be the reason we get
cancer, when the immune system

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:10%
fails for whatever reason.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:10%
And what is the
reason for failure?

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:10%
As you mentioned, toxicity.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:10%
And what kind of
toxicity do you have?

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, we all have too much
toxic metals in our body.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:84%
We all have too much
lead, cadmium, mercury.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.445 align:middle line:84%
And Walter Bloomer, have
you heard of Walter Bloomer

00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:04.245 align:middle line:90%
from Switzerland.

00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> He did a study where he gave
I forget the exact numbers,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.800 align:middle line:84%
50-some people got
chelation every month.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Chelation means metal binding.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:10%
It's a process of
putting a substance

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.400 align:middle line:10%
like EDTA in the body.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.620 align:middle line:10%
It hooks onto the metal,
floats it out the kidney.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.290 align:middle line:10%
And that's a major
detoxifier for heavy metals.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.360 align:middle line:10%
Sweating is good, too.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:10%


00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Sauna.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:10%
>> In Finland, they did a
study with saunas and sweating,

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:10%
and they found you could sweat
out more lead in an hour than

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:10%
you could pee out in 24 hours.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>> So sweating is good.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's still not
enough in most cases

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of the lead toxicity.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And Walter Bloomer
said that there

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.773 align:middle line:84%
was a 90% decrease in cancer in
patients who got the chelation.

00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>> A 90% decrease.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
He had 59 patients who got
treated, and one of them

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
got cancer over
an 18-year period.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Of 117 patients or so who
were the controls in a sense,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
they didn't get the chelation,
that group had 17 cancers.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.871 align:middle line:10%
The study was not
a perfect study,

00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:10%
but it was a very good
study and it was approved

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:10%
by the Swiss government.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
heavy metal link and talk

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.452 align:middle line:84%
about chelation therapy on
treating specifically cancer.

00:06:43.452 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you don't use chelation
to treat cancer or autism.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.744 align:middle line:10%
You treat chelation to
remove heavy metals.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And heavy metals cause
oxidative stress.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
oxidative stress that

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:84%
is the commonality
in all the toxicities

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.452 align:middle line:90%
that lead to disease.

00:06:58.452 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I actually often
have said that I'm

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.534 align:middle line:84%
nothing more than a
glorified trash man

00:07:01.534 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
because I just can take
out the trash better.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
That's really what
it comes down to.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:10%
>> In allopathic medicine,
Western medicine,

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:10%
what we accomplish in Western
medicine is stabilization

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.986 align:middle line:10%
of the patient.

00:07:14.986 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:10%
If their blood pressure
is high, we give them

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.800 align:middle line:10%
something to bring it down.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.550 align:middle line:10%
If their blood sugar
is high, we give them

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.211 align:middle line:10%
something to bring us down.

00:07:21.211 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:10%
If they're dehydrated,
we hydrate them.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.780 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.274 align:middle line:90%
We're not fixing any problems.

00:07:26.274 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You're just
alleviating the symptoms.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Alleviating the symptoms
is all we're doing.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:90%
But it stabilizes the patient.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.110 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:84%
That is the first
step of healing.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
If you have a bleeding wound,
the first step in first aid

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.657 align:middle line:90%
is to stop the bleeding.

00:07:43.657 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't do anything
with it till you

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
stop the bleeding, that's the
first rule in all first aid.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
If there's a bleeding
wound, put pressure on

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and stop the
bleeding, number one.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the next rule is
old dirty cuts never heal.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.520 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:10%
So if you have a dirty
wound, you have to clean it.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.690 align:middle line:10%
You have to detoxify it.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:10%
This is your next step.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:10%
Detoxification in the healing
process is the second step.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:10%
Once you're stable, you must
detoxify in order to progress.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.610 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, you're going
to just spin your wheels

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.159 align:middle line:10%
or spend a lot of money
just trying to feel better.

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:10%
You'll take a supplement,
you'll take a medicine,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.783 align:middle line:10%
you'll feel better
for a little while.

00:08:23.783 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It will work for a day,
two days, a month maybe.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
And then it doesn't do
anything because you're still

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:90%
managing toxins in your body.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:10%
So you've got to remove
the toxins from--

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.161 align:middle line:10%
if you're going
to plant a garden

00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:10%
and there's garbage
all over the ground,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:10%
you don't just till the
garbage into the ground.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.385 align:middle line:10%
You go and clean it up,
then you plant your seeds

00:08:50.385 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:10%
and you till your garden.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:90%
So a similar thing.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:90%
We have to get rid of the trash.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:10%
We've got to get
rid of the trash.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.258 align:middle line:10%
You've got to get all--

00:08:58.258 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:10%
because all those
toxins in your body

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:10%
are blocking the
healing process.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:10%
That might be amalgams
in your teeth,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:10%
it might be an infection, it
might be a yeast overgrowth,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:10%
it might be fluoride
or environmental toxins

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:10%
and pesticides,
herbicides, heavy metals,

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.480 align:middle line:10%
all these different things.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.590 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
removed out of the way.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Every one of those things is
a roadblock to your healing.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And you said earlier
in the interview

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
that if you are
nutritionally deficient,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:90%
you're a toxin sponge.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard you on our
radio show recently,

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
Robert Scott Belcher,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%
but you were mentioning that the
importance with detoxification

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
is that, and I wrote
down the quote,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
you have to make sure that the
exits are open and the filters

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:90%
filter quickly.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.040 align:middle line:90%
So talk about those comments.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
My favorite analogy
of that is if you

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
had a stadium with 10,000
people in it and there's a fire.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.350 align:middle line:84%
You've got to empty the
stadium, but you only

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.240 align:middle line:90%
have two exits open.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.120 align:middle line:90%
You're going to make a mess.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.680 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be a mess.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the bottom line.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:10%
This is not going
to turn out well.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:10%
But you open 10 different
exits, it's five times better;

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:10%
you open 20
different exits, it's

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.870 align:middle line:10%
going to be 10 times better.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.020 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:10%
In the body, we have
four major exits.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:10%
We have the bowels, we have
the respiratory system,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:10%
we have the urinary tract,
and we have the skin.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:35.970 align:middle line:10%
If those four are open, things
can exit through those routes,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:10%
detoxification isn't so bad.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:10%
It's not so painful.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:10%
If you get a cut that's
scabbed over but it's dirty

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:10%
and so it's festering
and infected,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.890 align:middle line:10%
you're going to have to pull
that scab off to get in there

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:10%
and wash the infection out.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And it ain't
going to be pleasant.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.555 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not going
to be pleasant.

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.192 align:middle line:84%
If it didn't have
the scab on there,

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:90%
the exit would be a lot easier.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So there's cleansing that has to
happen to open up the pathways.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:10%
Then once you've opened up the
exits, working on the filters--

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:10%
the liver, the kidneys,
the lymphatic system--

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.150 align:middle line:10%
getting those things
moving and metabolizing

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.210 align:middle line:10%
as fast as possible.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:10%
That way, they filter the toxins
out of the body and everything

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:10%
you do detox is much easier.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:38.880 align:middle line:10%
That's where colon cleansing,
saunas, colonic irrigations,

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:10%
those types of things that just
flush the body, open the exits.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Those are initially some of
the best things to start with.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Because you can start
working on the filters--

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
the kidneys, the liver,
the lymphatic system.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:84%
If they don't have anywhere
to dump the garbage,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:90%
it's going to recirculate.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And that just creates
all kinds of information

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:84%
that increases your
rate of oxidation.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.835 align:middle line:84%
You're just re-exposing
yourself to toxins.

00:12:12.835 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So according to Dr.
Buttar we've got to take out

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:90%
the trash.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Or in the words of
Dr. Newsome, we've

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:90%
got to remove the roadblocks.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:90%
But what about foods?

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Can foods help us to
detoxify our bodies?

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to Dr. Leigh
Erin Connealy and Mike

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Adams, the Health Ranger,
as they talk about the fact

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
that foods can actually
bind to heavy metals

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and help us to
detoxify our bodies.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.350 align:middle line:10%
>> The process of their job,
they're dealing with mercury.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:10%
So mercury is everywhere.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Arsenic, I mean,
"Discover Magazine"

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.050 align:middle line:84%
had the front cover,
metals in your food.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the EPA says
there's no safe level

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:84%
of any toxic heavy
metal in your body.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.150 align:middle line:90%
So when they put norms there--

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, first of all, how do I
know what's normal for you?

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.984 align:middle line:84%
What may be normal for you may
be terribly destructive to me.

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Because we're individual.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>> We're individuals.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I might not
be able to handle

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:84%
one a little anything of mercury
and you might be able to, oh, I

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:90%
can handle this.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:90%
I can manage it.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But the EPA, the Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
says there is no safe
level of these metals--

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
arsenic, mercury,
aluminum-- in your body.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:31.252 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to eat foods
that help us detoxify.

00:13:31.252 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I've done extensive research
on what's called the metals

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
capturing capacity of
different types of foods.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I call it the MCC.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:10%
Where I test using a synthetic
gastric acid digestion

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.495 align:middle line:10%
simulator that I
built in the lab.

00:13:45.495 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:10%
I test foods versus
contaminants.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And I find out how
much of the contaminant

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
gets bound to the food
and thereby carried out

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.010 align:middle line:84%
of your digestive tract
as insoluble fiber,

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
rather than being absorbed
through your walls

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and going into your blood.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a key
concept to understand

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:90%
to answer your question.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Processed foods, have very
low capturing capacity

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
because the thigh
bones are typically

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.710 align:middle line:90%
processed out of them.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:84%
They're also structurally
compromised through processing.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.757 align:middle line:84%
They're denatured,
in other words.

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:19.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:19.556 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:90%
Which makes them into un-food.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Un-food.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat let's
say a processed food

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.100 align:middle line:84%
meal or a beverage that is
contaminated with let's say

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
10 parts per million
of mercury, you

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.297 align:middle line:84%
are likely to absorb the
vast majority of that mercury

00:14:34.297 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
through your intestinal walls
that goes into your blood.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be
radioactive cesium 137.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Mercury, cesium, lead,
cadmium, you name it.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Whatever it might be.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you are eating a diet
of unprocessed fresh foods,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:84%
this is a whole
plant-based diet--

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.010 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to be 100% plants.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
What we have found is that
natural plants, fresh produce

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:05.100 align:middle line:84%
such as strawberries, have very
high natural metals capturing

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.780 align:middle line:90%
capacity.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
They're able to
bind with the metals

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.420 align:middle line:84%
mostly through physical
processes of absorption

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and adsorption as well.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Some foods have
selective ionic affinity

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.894 align:middle line:84%
to specific metals
such as lead--

00:15:20.894 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Which means they--

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> That they have a chemical
reaction that binds up

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:90%
the metal.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It's chemistry taking place
in the acidic environment

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
of your stomach, technically,
with your own gastric acid.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.159 align:middle line:84%
So strawberries, for example--
this is something that

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I've researched and I'm still
working on the scientific paper

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:41.790 align:middle line:90%
to put out there--

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
but strawberries will
bind with over 90%

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.649 align:middle line:84%
of your dietary
mercury, strawberries.

00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this is the
case is because strawberries

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.830 align:middle line:84%
are the only common
fruit that has seeds

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.470 align:middle line:90%
on the outside of the fruit.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:84%
The seeds being on
the outside, how

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.020 align:middle line:84%
are they grown, how are they
produced by the strawberry?

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
strands, fibers, that

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:09.810 align:middle line:84%
send nutrients to the seeds from
the center of the strawberry.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.600 align:middle line:84%
The center is where
it gets its nutrition.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
It distributes it through
the fibers to the seeds.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:10%
These fibers, which are
transparent practically

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:10%
under a microscope, happen to
be very, very tough fibers.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
They will not be digested by
nitric acid in the laboratory.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I can take strawberries,
I can mix nitric acid--

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
we're talking like 70% nitric
acid, very strong oxidizer

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that would burn the skin
right off your hand--

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
it will not digest the thigh
bones and the strawberry.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The thigh bones survive
human digestion,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
which is far weaker than
nitric acid digestion.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, orders of
magnitude weaker.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:84%
The strawberries then will
bind to the dietary mercury

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.960 align:middle line:84%
with these fibers and that
gets pushed out of your system

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:90%
through bowel movements.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%
The mercury is gone, it's out.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It never gets pulled
into your bloodstream

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:90%
through your intestinal walls.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So many different types
of fruits and vegetables

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
have very interesting
affinities to heavy metals,

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and this is what our research
has really uncovered.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.670 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that we found
better than strawberries,

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:84%
by the way, is chlorella, which
is about 98% to 99% efficacy.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
But chlorella doesn't work for
other things such as uranium.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Chlorella doesn't
absorb much uranium.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Spirulina does, but
not strawberries.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that I've done in the lab

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
is whether it's radioactive
elements, such as cesium

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:84%
137 or customary heavy
metals like mercury,

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
arsenic, things
that cause cancer.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Arsenic is linked
to cancer, right?

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:46.136 --> 00:17:48.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, and by the way, do
you know what tends to absorb

00:17:48.427 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:90%
arsenic?

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Fruit seeds.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:52.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Fruit seeds.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Fruit seeds.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.799 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is why some fruit
seeds contain arsenic naturally.

00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:90%
There's arsenic in apple juice.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Remember that scare?

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I remember that.

00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:05.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Because apple plants, apple
trees tend to take up arsenic

00:18:05.107 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:84%
in the soil, which
came from the lead,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:84%
arsenic pesticides
that were talked about.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
They tend to
concentrate in the seed

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:84%
because the seeds have a
natural affinity to arsenic.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:19.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you can get apple seeds,
grape seeds, raspberry seeds,

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:90%
blueberry seeds--

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, we've
tested all these things--

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:84%
if you can get your hands on
these seeds, which by the way

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
are removed from
almost all of the food

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:84%
that are sold in
the grocery store.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.544 align:middle line:84%
If you buy grape jam, you
don't want seeds in it.

00:18:33.544 --> 00:18:35.960 align:middle line:84%
If you buy blueberry jelly,
you don't want blueberry seeds

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's where
all the good stuff is.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.325 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the seeds that bind
with the dietary arsenic

00:18:41.325 --> 00:18:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and transport it
out of your body.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I haven't released
that information yet.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.927 align:middle line:84%
You're the first person
to have this conversation.

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Mike Adams,
the Health Ranger,

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
just shared with
us about the MCC,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
the metals capturing
capacity, of certain foods.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Now, what about coffee?

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.483 align:middle line:84%
I know certain people would
swear that coffee is a food,

00:18:59.483 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:90%
and maybe it technically is.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:84%
But are there any
properties of coffee

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that could help us to
detoxify our bodies?

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to two
prominent medical doctors

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.860 align:middle line:90%
chime in on this issue.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Concerning coffee enemas,
is that something you think

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.089 align:middle line:84%
would be appropriate
for people that may not

00:19:14.089 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
have been diagnosed with
cancer but just in light

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.110 align:middle line:84%
of the toxic
overload that we have

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.870 align:middle line:84%
today that's something that
could stimulate the liver

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
to help create
all of the toxins?

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.108 align:middle line:84%
Is that something that
is good for people

00:19:24.108 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:90%
that don't have cancer?

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe so.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, I have to put
in a disclaimer

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.440 align:middle line:10%
when I say something
like that since we

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:10%
live in a litigious world.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'll say that I'm not
telling any of your audience,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm not advising them to do it.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:84%
They need to get instruction
on how to do it properly.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:84%
But having said that, yes,
I do think that they're

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:90%
beneficial for anybody.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.056 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people find
they feel better with them.

00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:50.190 align:middle line:90%
So they tend to sell themselves.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
None of our patients coming
in for the first time

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.915 align:middle line:84%
ever believe this,
but I tell them,

00:19:54.915 --> 00:19:57.040 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be your
favorite part of the program.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.279 align:middle line:84%
And they come back and say,
you're absolutely right.

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I never miss the coffee
enemas because they

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:90%
made me feel so much better.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it about the coffee
in the enemas that helps

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:90%
to detoxify the body?

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Interestingly enough,
when you drink coffee,

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.601 align:middle line:90%
it tends to suppress the liver.

00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:10%
When you take coffee
as an enema rectally,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:10%
the caffeine stimulates
a bunch of nerves

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.535 align:middle line:10%
in the lower colon called the
sacral parasympathetic nerves.

00:20:16.535 --> 00:20:18.035 align:middle line:84%
When they are turned
on by caffeine,

00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:84%
they feed back to the
liver through a reflex arc

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and within seconds
cause the liver

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:90%
to release all its toxins.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Nothing helps the liver clean
out faster, more efficiently,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.100 align:middle line:84%
more effectively
than coffee enemas.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And for cancer patients,
when you're breaking down

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.390 align:middle line:84%
a tumor quickly with
the enzyme, you've

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.806 align:middle line:84%
got all this tumor
debris that can

00:20:32.806 --> 00:20:34.502 align:middle line:90%
be deadly and life-threatening.

00:20:34.502 --> 00:20:36.960 align:middle line:84%
It gets the liver to work better
so they process this tumor

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
waste very effectively
and then you just

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.134 align:middle line:90%
poop them out with the enemas.

00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:84%
So interestingly enough,
when you drink coffee

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
it's really toxic
to a cancer patient.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:84%
When you take it rectally, it
opens up the liver so the liver

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.539 align:middle line:84%
dumps in the small
intestine and you

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:50.121 align:middle line:84%
get rid of all this dead
tumor waste very effectively.

00:20:50.121 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I have patients that when
they're breaking down tumor,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:84%
you get an autoimmune
reaction to the tumor

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and you get fevers of
103 and 104 do an enema

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and literally within 20 minutes,
the fever goes down to normal.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:90%
We see this routinely.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And indeed,
conventional oncologists

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:84%
know today in 2014
that nothing is

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
more toxic to the human
body than dead cancer.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, chemotherapy, though
it doesn't work for most cancers

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
does work for some like
Hodgkin's and certainly

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:90%
leukemias.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.157 align:middle line:84%
And in a Hodgkin's patient, if
you break a tumor down too fast

00:21:17.157 --> 00:21:19.490 align:middle line:84%
with chemo, you'll kill the
patient from the dead tumor.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.946 align:middle line:84%
They call it tumor
lysis syndrome.

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:22.320 align:middle line:84%
It's recognized
in the textbooks.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
All of my conventional
textbooks talk about it.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.574 align:middle line:84%
Well, Kelly recognized
that back in 1963

00:21:27.574 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
when he was trying to
get over his own cancer.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And he started going into the
literature as he always did.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:90%
He was a great scholar.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:84%
He would go into the
literature trying

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:84%
to find some technique
that would help his liver

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.620 align:middle line:90%
and kidneys work better.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.130 align:middle line:84%
The liver and the kidney are
the body's main detoxification

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:90%
organs.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.041 align:middle line:84%
That's where
environmental chemicals,

00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:84%
our own metabolic
waste, the dead cancer

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.559 align:middle line:84%
are processed and neutralized
and compared for secretion.

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:10%
He opens up the "Merck
Manual" and lo and behold,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.120 align:middle line:10%
there are coffee enemas.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:10%
The interesting thing or the
sad thing is, the ironic thing,

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.582 align:middle line:10%
Kelly was brutalized
in the media

00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:55.790 align:middle line:10%
for his use of coffee enemas.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We get attacked
about it today, too.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But they come right out of
the conventional medical

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.180 align:middle line:90%
literature.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.150 align:middle line:84%
He didn't learn about it from
alien space beings projected

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.697 align:middle line:84%
into his brain through some
mystic psychic experience.

00:22:05.697 --> 00:22:08.030 align:middle line:84%
He didn't learn about through
some alternative throwaway

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.321 align:middle line:90%
journals on the health history.

00:22:09.321 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:84%
He learned about it from the
conventional medical textbooks.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
The "Merck Manual"
is a compendium

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:90%
of conventional therapies.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were in
the "Merck Manual,"

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.706 align:middle line:84%
coffee enemas were
in the "Merck Manual"

00:22:17.706 --> 00:22:19.160 align:middle line:90%
right up until the 1970s.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So Dr. Isaacs and Dr.
Gonzales both just shared with

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.110 align:middle line:84%
us about the way that coffee
enemas help us to detoxify

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:90%
the liver.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:84%
While we're talking
about coffee enemas,

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.930 align:middle line:84%
let's listen to what
Suzanne Somers had

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.179 align:middle line:84%
to say about the time period
when she was interviewing

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:84%
several of Dr.
Gonzales' patients

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:84%
as she was preparing to
write her bestselling book,

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
"Knockout."

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>> When I wrote "Knockout," I
interviewed 17 of his patients.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'd just like
to talk to stage fours.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:51.595 align:middle line:10%
And I remember there were
these two older women.

00:22:51.595 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:10%
When I interviewed them,
I thought they were older,

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.600 align:middle line:10%
but they're sort of close
to what my age is now.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Funny how time flies.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're both in their 70s
and one had stage four breast,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
one had stage four ovarian
only been treated by Nick.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:17.310 align:middle line:84%
One had stage four ovarian for
17 years, the other stage four

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:84%
breast at that
time for 12 years.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I haven't asked Nick
recently, but as of last year,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:84%
they're both still
alive and thriving.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
And I played devil's advocate.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:84%
I said, really, you do
coffee enemas every day?

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And they started joking and
the older one said, yeah.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I particularly
like French roast.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
She said, gets me
kind of all juiced up.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:84%
But it makes sense that if you
keep cleaning out the liver,

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
and a coffee enema goes back to
early Egyptian Cleopatra era,

00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.990 align:middle line:84%
cleaning out the liver
of toxins in a time

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
in the world where our livers
are groaning from intoxication.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.150 align:middle line:84%
You wonder how anybody
can be alive without doing

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.676 align:middle line:90%
regular liver cleanse.

00:24:14.676 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's some great
information from Suzanne

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Somers, one of America's
most beloved personalities.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:90%
What about water?

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
What effect does
water have on our body

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:90%
and does it help us to detoxify?

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.951 align:middle line:84%
>> The pH of your
blood is what matters.

00:24:28.951 --> 00:24:31.325 align:middle line:10%
The pH of urine is a grade
from an assessment perspective

00:24:31.325 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:10%
trying to understand what's
going on from a toxin burden

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:10%
from some other things.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%
But the pH of the blood is where
we actually see the blood's

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.090 align:middle line:90%
ability to carry out toxins.

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
If we can keep the blood
pH at a 7.45, which

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
is the threshold of
blood, then we're

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:51.096 align:middle line:84%
going to have far more
dissolved oxygen in that blood.

00:24:51.096 --> 00:24:53.220 align:middle line:84%
When we have more oxygen,
we carry out more toxins.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
For instance, patients
that are suffering

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:59.460 align:middle line:84%
from significant pathology
like cancer, if we

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.734 align:middle line:84%
can keep their
blood pH at a 7.45

00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
and have more
oxygen in the blood,

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:04.620 align:middle line:84%
their energy levels
are going to increase,

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.370 align:middle line:84%
their metabolic rate
is going to increase,

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
carry out more toxins.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got to drink
the right kind of water.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:90%
And again, steeped in science.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.860 align:middle line:90%
There's no hocus pocus here.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:90%
People say, well, yeah, Bob.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:84%
I know I need water,
I need to hydrate.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I hear that all the time.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:19.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:90%
But where's the pill?

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:90%
They just don't get it.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Because again, as
I said previously,

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:90%
it's too simple for them.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Water is too simple, the
right diet is too simple.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I need something
with drugs in it,

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I need a pill, something
that can actually

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:90%
knock this cancer out.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:90%
And I'm saying, no, no, no.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:10%
You're missing this.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.140 align:middle line:10%
Each 12-ounce
glass of this water

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.660 align:middle line:10%
hydrates the body better
than anything else

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:10%
you can put in it.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It's reshaped water.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.540 align:middle line:84%
It's reshaped hexagonal like
your cells so it goes right in.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.150 align:middle line:90%
It's micro structured water.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Each glass has more
antioxidant capacity

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:84%
than all the organic
fruits and vegetables

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
you could possibly
eat in one day.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Plus, it's the fastest way
to bring an acidic body back

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:84%
to alkalinity that
we know of today.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:90%
So it is steeped in science.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.000 align:middle line:10%
We have seen reversals of
end stage cancer patients

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:10%
with pancreatic cancer,
lung cancer, liver cancer,

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:10%
all the mostly
fatal ones sent home

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:10%
to die with less than 90 days.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:10%
These people are well today.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.570 align:middle line:10%
What did they do?

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:10%
They changed their water.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:10%
That's all they did.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.460 align:middle line:10%
Of course, I recommend
you do more than that.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.835 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
change food, you've

00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:84%
got to change your water,
you've got to detoxify the body.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.330 align:middle line:84%
We have a new
detoxification procedure

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.160 align:middle line:90%
which is whole body detox.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:90%
It's called PIOH.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the acronym, P-I-O-H.
I write about it in the new

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:90%
edition of my book.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.426 align:middle line:90%
It's that important.

00:26:42.426 --> 00:26:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Precision intestinal
oxidative hydrotoning.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It starts looking like
colonic hydrotherapy,

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:90%
but way different.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.030 align:middle line:84%
There's 100 ways to do
colonic hydrotherapy.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:84%
One is shutting the person up
with a garden hose in a room,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and that one's not very pretty.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:84%
But this starts looking
like colonic hydrotherapy,

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's done with specialized
equipment and perfected water.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.600 align:middle line:84%
They take water and put it
through a six-stage filtration

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.830 align:middle line:84%
process to perfect the water,
and it's really the secret.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they utilize
the water with ozone.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:84%
So you've got H2O,
the water; you've

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.660 align:middle line:84%
got ozone, O3 combining
within the colon

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.590 align:middle line:84%
to start with to create what
we call polyatomic oxygen.

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So it could morph into O17 or
O22 or something like that.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But the thrust of this
is that it permeates

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.020 align:middle line:84%
not only the large
intestine and the colon,

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.540 align:middle line:84%
but also the oxygen
permeates all the cells

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.750 align:middle line:90%
and goes into the body.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Oxygen is good for a cancer
patient and for all of us.

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.945 align:middle line:84%
>> So water is of
vital importance

00:27:45.945 --> 00:27:48.780 align:middle line:90%
in the detoxification puzzle.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:50.470 align:middle line:90%
But what about emotions?

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Can negative emotions, feelings
of despair, negative thoughts

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:90%
be detrimental to your health?

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.784 align:middle line:84%
What about the
feeling of despair,

00:27:58.784 --> 00:27:59.950 align:middle line:90%
does that have any kind of--

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The Bible that says that
the power of life and death is

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:90%
in the tongue.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So if you pronounce
somebody dead,

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:84%
they see the doctors
as an authority.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:18.420 align:middle line:10%
And so they buy it, I'm
dead, no matter what.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:22.540 align:middle line:10%
And the truth is that not
only doctors are not gods--

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:10%
we don't know--

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.930 align:middle line:10%
but nobody in this
room knows if we're

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.510 align:middle line:10%
going to be alive tomorrow.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And by the same
token, you can never

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.625 align:middle line:84%
say that a cancer
patient is going to die.

00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:34.000 align:middle line:84%
We've had patients
that were told

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.791 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to die in three months

00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and 20 years later--
you met one, [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:84%
27 years later,
she's still alive.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:84%
She's not cured, but she's
alive, enjoying life.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the first thing
that I impress on a patient

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:56.055 align:middle line:84%
is that victory over cancer is
a decision, not a happening.

00:28:56.055 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be victorious
for the tumor to go away.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
There are patients that
have surgery and chemo

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and then the tumor goes
away and they can't sleep.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't know
when it's coming back.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So they're tumor-free
but not free of cancer.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
patients that say,

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:84%
cancer is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Before I had cancer, I
took everything for granted

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:90%
and now I see life is beautiful.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of this
cancer that I can see that

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and cancer is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So that person is
riddled with cancer

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:90%
and is victorious over cancer.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I know many people
that fit that description.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it's very important
if you have victory over cancer

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.216 align:middle line:84%
in your mind,
everything follows.

00:29:37.216 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:84%
If you decide that
you're going to die,

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult
to bring you back.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Victor Frankl
could determine who

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:48.146 align:middle line:84%
was going to die within 24
hours in the concentration camp,

00:29:48.146 --> 00:29:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and it was when they
smoked their cigarettes.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.510 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, cigarettes
cannot cause cancer in 24 hours.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Cigarettes were their hope
and they traded everything

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.420 align:middle line:90%
with cigarettes.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So when they had
no more hope, they

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.725 align:middle line:84%
started smoking their cigarettes
like you burning your money.

00:30:03.725 --> 00:30:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And they would
die within 24 hours.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So the power of
hope is incredible.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.510 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're
the oasis of hope.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:10%
And we've been
criticized enormously

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.910 align:middle line:10%
for selling false hope.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And my question is, well,
if false hope is telling,

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:84%
you are going to live, what
is true hope, you're dead?

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>> No, there is no
false true hope.

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.550 align:middle line:90%
There's hope or no hope.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it reminds
me, Dr. Contreras,

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of a quote from
Charlotte Gerson,

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.300 align:middle line:84%
who was accused of spreading
false hope, much like yourself.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And she accused them of
spreading false despair.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, really true despair.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>> True despair.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> You're dead.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
chemotherapy now

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and you'll live six more
months with no hair, vomiting.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> A negative thought can kill
you faster than a bad germ.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So one of the main things
of detoxifying is here.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>> The mind.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> The mind.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.790 align:middle line:10%
The emotions, the
conflicts, the traumas

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:10%
going back to what
we said earlier.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:10%
>> So detoxing those
psychological, emotional,

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.440 align:middle line:10%
biological conflicts
and trauma is key.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> What a telling quote, "a
negative thought can kill you

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.586 align:middle line:90%
faster than a bad germ."

00:31:24.586 --> 00:31:25.960 align:middle line:84%
We know that when
you're stressed

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.310 align:middle line:84%
that you secrete adrenaline
cortisol, which then

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.560 align:middle line:90%
compromises the immune system.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.210 align:middle line:90%
So that makes sense to me.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.860 align:middle line:90%
What about epigenetics?

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.170 align:middle line:84%
What exactly does epigenetics
mean and what about the placebo

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:36.970 align:middle line:90%
effect?

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.344 align:middle line:84%
You've heard the stories of
people that took a sugar pill

00:31:39.344 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:90%
and got better.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Listen up.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.500 align:middle line:10%
>> You're always hearing
about genes and genomes now.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And we know about
genetics and epigenetics.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, Angelina Jolie
was dealt a bad hand

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.750 align:middle line:84%
by doctors who simply don't
know but think they know.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:10%
Why would a woman with
two perfectly good breasts

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.860 align:middle line:10%
who carries a BRCA1
defective gene

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.390 align:middle line:10%
have them
prophylactically removed

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.990 align:middle line:10%
because someone said her
chances of cancer went up?

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The odds are if you
live right, and this

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:15.130 align:middle line:84%
is called the epigenetics,
the cancer will never,

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:18.700 align:middle line:84%
ever manifest
itself in your body.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.260 align:middle line:84%
If the genetics is the
computer, the epigenetics

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.230 align:middle line:84%
is the software that
drives it and runs it.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.540 align:middle line:90%
We now have epigenetic products.

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.810 align:middle line:84%
We recommend now
a supplement that

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:36.290 align:middle line:84%
is the only one that is proven
to be epigenetic in nature.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it can
turn off the bad genes

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:90%
and turn on the good genes.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:84%
We're pretty excited
about that, although we

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:84%
know that there's a
lot of foods out there

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that do the same
thing right now.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So we've already
got that answer.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.620 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.360 align:middle line:84%
We just need to pay
more attention to it

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and actually utilize
these types of things.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.520 align:middle line:84%
We'll have much less
cancer or any disease.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:10%
So when you mention
epigenetics, you're

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.280 align:middle line:10%
talking about lifestyle
choices, things

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.520 align:middle line:10%
that folks can do
that would stop

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.610 align:middle line:10%
their potential
genetic predisposition

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.630 align:middle line:10%
from manifesting.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.750 align:middle line:10%
What you can do, what
you can stop doing,

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.350 align:middle line:10%
things that you can take,
foods that you can eat,

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:10%
supplements that you can take
that change what people think

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.310 align:middle line:10%
is that predestination, that
a gene or a defective gene

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.110 align:middle line:10%
gives you.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we all have
strengths and weaknesses.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And in homeopathy,
we talk about miasms,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.680 align:middle line:90%
inherited predispositions.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like we ignore
genetics completely.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is what makes
them manifest is environment.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.642 align:middle line:84%
This gets into something
called epigenetics.

00:33:41.642 --> 00:33:43.350 align:middle line:10%
One of my favorite
interviews a few times

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.340 align:middle line:10%
I've met him and befriended him,
the cellular biologist Bruce

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.250 align:middle line:10%
Lipton about opened my eyes to
this whole field of epigenetics

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.860 align:middle line:10%
that the environment impacts
on genetic expression

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:57.060 align:middle line:10%
and that your very belief
about life and everything

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.560 align:middle line:10%
impacts on genetic expression.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.714 align:middle line:84%
So you can literally change
your genes by what you believe.

00:34:01.714 --> 00:34:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you
talk to any doctors that

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.250 align:middle line:84%
work with cancer
holistically, they'll

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.110 align:middle line:84%
recognize that they
can do everything

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to remove toxins and replenish
the soil of the body,

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.659 align:middle line:84%
give the minerals and things,
but if the patient doesn't

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:84%
believe he or she
will get well, there's

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
not a lot you can do
ultimately in that regard.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I will tell you this, I
think that in modern medicine,

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:84%
this demonization of placebo
effect is the most ridiculous

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.830 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.854 align:middle line:90%
We should be harnessing it.

00:34:27.854 --> 00:34:28.979 align:middle line:90%
We should be harnessing it.

00:34:28.979 --> 00:34:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>> It works.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many times
I've used placebo on purpose.

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:38.755 align:middle line:10%
When I was in general surgery,
part of our surgical rotation

00:34:38.755 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:10%
is you have to do
trauma surgery,

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.546 align:middle line:10%
you have to do general surgery
different types of surgery.

00:34:42.546 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:84%
And when we did trauma
at Brooke Army Medical

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Center, a large trauma
center, as well as at Baylor

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:90%
in Houston--

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.919 align:middle line:84%
>> BAMC-- Brooke
Army and Baylor.

00:34:50.919 --> 00:34:51.719 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So I spent a lot of time
in both those hospitals.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But we'd have a
lot of drug addicts

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that would come through,
gunshot wounds, knifings,

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:90%
drug deal gone bad whatever.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.687 align:middle line:84%
And while they're in
recovery after the surgery

00:35:07.687 --> 00:35:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and they may be in the
hospital for a month,

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.920 align:middle line:84%
two months, three
months these people

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.544 align:middle line:84%
are going through
withdrawals, big time

00:35:12.544 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:84%
withdrawals from alcohol,
from drugs, whatever.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.352 align:middle line:84%
And as an intern,
as a resident, you

00:35:18.352 --> 00:35:20.560 align:middle line:84%
make rounds with the senior
residents and everything.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And as an intern,
you make rounds

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.500 align:middle line:84%
before everybody else
at 5:30 in the morning.

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And as a first-year
resident, you

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:30.473 align:middle line:84%
usually go over with the
intern to see what is going on.

00:35:30.473 --> 00:35:33.556 align:middle line:84%
And I got the reputation
among the people

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that were in the hospital that
I would take care of their issue

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.790 align:middle line:90%
if they had an issue.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.325 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason I
got this reputation,

00:35:38.325 --> 00:35:40.427 align:middle line:84%
when you've got a guy
that's been hooked on drugs

00:35:40.427 --> 00:35:42.510 align:middle line:84%
for more than half his
life, he's in the hospital,

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.580 align:middle line:90%
he's going through withdrawal--

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.784 align:middle line:90%
I'm having chest pain, doc.

00:35:45.784 --> 00:35:47.200 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do
something for me.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:90%
And I would say, OK, listen.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I can get kicked out of my
residency program if I do this.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And you've talked to the
nurse and the nurse already

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.556 align:middle line:90%
knows what's going on.

00:35:54.556 --> 00:35:55.480 align:middle line:90%
The nurse is arguing.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.000 align:middle line:84%
She's like, no, Dr.
Buttar, we can't do this.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And I go, we have to.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:58.740 align:middle line:90%
He really needs this.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:90%
It's only one time.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:35:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:90%
You won't ask for-- yeah, doc.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Just one time.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And you'd give him this hit
and say it's really, really

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:04.930 align:middle line:90%
some strong stuff.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:05.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.380 align:middle line:84%
This is like way--
well, what is it?

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.580 align:middle line:90%
It's like Sufenta.

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.460 align:middle line:84%
What, you're going
to give me Sufenta?

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's so good.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you give them
this thing and they go, ah.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling better.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.060 align:middle line:84%
You know and you've
just given them saline.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.920 align:middle line:84%
But the power of belief, they
believed there was something

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.580 align:middle line:84%
because I'm making a whole
orchestrated like soap opera

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.380 align:middle line:90%
we had going on.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.796 align:middle line:84%
There were like five or six
people all involved with this.

00:36:27.796 --> 00:36:29.760 align:middle line:84%
The person felt like
we gave them something.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:84%
They were willing to not
perform for you because you

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:90%
did something for them.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:84%
They thought that
you just gave them

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.070 align:middle line:84%
something that really took
care of their addiction

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and it was all in the mind.

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.080 align:middle line:90%
It was just saline.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And more than half
the time, it worked.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're telling me that
we should just write that off?

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you know what, you
could give a person a drug

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.528 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't get
that kind of effect.

00:36:49.528 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:90%
We should harness that power.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.490 align:middle line:10%
So if we can actually
elicit that type of response

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.320 align:middle line:10%
in an individual
where we can get

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.295 align:middle line:10%
a benefit in that individual
from just the power of belief

00:36:58.295 --> 00:37:00.660 align:middle line:10%
without changing
the physiology, it's

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.180 align:middle line:10%
our ethical fiduciary
responsibility as healers,

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.970 align:middle line:10%
as doctors, to harness that
power and get that result.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if we can do
so with the least harm,

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.562 align:middle line:84%
that's the first part of being
a doctor, right, do no harm.

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you give
somebody narcotics,

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.580 align:middle line:84%
you are affecting them
in a negative way.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.845 align:middle line:84%
You're affecting
the liver, there

00:37:15.845 --> 00:37:16.928 align:middle line:90%
is harm that's being done.

00:37:16.928 --> 00:37:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we can get the same
result without giving them

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:90%
a narcotic, why shouldn't we?

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.230 align:middle line:90%
And why is that poo-pooed?

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.512 align:middle line:84%
Why is that ridiculed that you
got this result from a placebo?

00:37:25.512 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:84%
You should get a
Nobel Prize if you

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.781 align:middle line:84%
can elicit a response
from placebo, as

00:37:28.781 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:90%
far as I'm concerned at least.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:31.770 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:32.570 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you've done
no harm and you've

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.455 align:middle line:90%
potentially healed the patient.

00:37:36.455 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Just from the
power of belief.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:38.933 align:middle line:90%
The power of belief.

00:37:38.933 --> 00:37:40.674 align:middle line:84%
>> And the power
to heal is yours.

00:37:40.674 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
That's how we do our radio
show every Monday, right?

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.100 align:middle line:90%
The power to heal is yours.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is a perfect example
of the power of healing

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.050 align:middle line:90%
is that individuals.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:90%
It's their right.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.338 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to agree
with Dr. Buttar,

00:37:50.338 --> 00:37:52.300 align:middle line:90%
the power to heal is yours.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, while I was out in
California earlier this year,

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.603 align:middle line:84%
I was able to sit down and
talk to Burton Goldberg

00:37:56.603 --> 00:37:58.460 align:middle line:90%
about the lymphatic system.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the systems that
is the garbage removal system

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.980 align:middle line:90%
of our body is the lymph system.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And very few cancer
physicians pay attention

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.980 align:middle line:90%
to the lymph system.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:10%
It is the basis of lymphocytes.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.570 align:middle line:10%
These are the good guys.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:21.310 align:middle line:10%
And it also is the garbage
removal system of the body.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And I use a device myself, I
have one that I use on myself,

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.830 align:middle line:90%
called the light beam generator.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But there's a few of them that
fractionalize the molecules.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we have our patients
do as we have them do things

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.570 align:middle line:90%
like rebounding.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Rebounding is one of the
best exercises against cancer

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and every other disease because
it moves your lymph system

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.229 align:middle line:90%
better than anything else.

00:38:44.229 --> 00:38:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And moving your lymph is
the most important thing

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:middle line:90%
against cancer and disease.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That's fascinating,
Dr. Wolfe.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why, tell us why.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Why is rebounding so important?

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, remember what I said,
I always want you to question

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.220 align:middle line:10%
people.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.300 align:middle line:10%
I want all my patients--

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.700 align:middle line:10%
I say, you question me and
you question everyone else.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.580 align:middle line:84%
If they're not speaking logic,
if one and one don't make two

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:84%
or if you go there and
you go, I'm confused,

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.420 align:middle line:84%
or if you feel
fear from something

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, chances are I am lying
or I don't know I'm lying.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:11.980 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.734 align:middle line:90%
So rebounding, think about it.

00:39:15.734 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
When your children were
young and they couldn't walk

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and they were like little
babies and they were crying,

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:90%
what did you do for them, Ty?

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember?

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.260 align:middle line:84%
You bounced them on your
knee or you rocked them

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.060 align:middle line:90%
on your shoulder.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do that?

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Because you aren't
totally brainwashed.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:84%
You still have
some instinct left.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.310 align:middle line:90%
So you rocked the baby.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.983 align:middle line:84%
And you rocked the baby
because the only way

00:39:43.983 --> 00:39:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that the lymph system can
move is by up and down motion.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And your lymph
system, OK, you've

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.780 align:middle line:90%
got eight pints of blood.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But you've got 12
quarts of lymph.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't you forget that.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you find that you're
getting all puffy and swollen,

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that's your lymph system
and you're in big trouble.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.217 align:middle line:84%
So you know when people
swell up like a puff ball?

00:40:05.217 --> 00:40:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's because
they're retaining water

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:09.720 align:middle line:84%
because they're so bloody toxic
and they've been backing up

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.370 align:middle line:90%
waste for years.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:14.649 align:middle line:84%
So when you start cleansing out
the colon and then you rebound,

00:40:14.649 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:90%
you're moving that stuff.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:17.130 align:middle line:84%
If you move the
circulation, it's

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.740 align:middle line:84%
like if the water doesn't
move, you better not

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.630 align:middle line:84%
drink it because it's
going to kill you

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.910 align:middle line:90%
because it has to circulate.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So rebounding also exercises
every cell individually,

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:29.670 align:middle line:90%
toning it.

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Excellent information
from Dr. Wolfe.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Rebounding stimulates the
lymphatic system better

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.700 align:middle line:90%
than any other exercise.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But I know you're
asking a question, what

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:90%
is the lymphatic system?

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to Dr. Irvin Sahni
explain the lymphatic system

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:44.910 align:middle line:84%
and we'll learn
exactly why it's so

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:47.190 align:middle line:90%
important in our overall health.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Talk about the lymphatic system.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.050 align:middle line:90%
What is the lymphatic system?

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So the lymphatic
system is something

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that I think people aren't
as aware of as their lungs

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.100 align:middle line:90%
and their heart.

00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The lymphatic system is
basically, to some degree,

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.700 align:middle line:90%
an overflow valve for the body.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:10%
So what happens is we all
know our heart pumps blood out

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.707 align:middle line:10%
to our distal extremities.

00:41:08.707 --> 00:41:10.290 align:middle line:10%
They go from arteries
and the arteries

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.550 align:middle line:10%
go to capillaries and
then the capillaries.

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So most of the blood that
pumps through your body,

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that's constantly
pumping your body,

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.890 align:middle line:84%
goes from arteries to
capillaries and passes

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.522 align:middle line:84%
back into your
heart through veins

00:41:22.522 --> 00:41:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and goes through the
circuit through your heart

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.740 align:middle line:90%
and your lungs.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.210 align:middle line:90%
There is some bleed-off--

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:29.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's what we call
interstitial pressure

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:30.070 align:middle line:90%
in tissues--

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.300 align:middle line:84%
and there's some bleed-off
where fluid, and a lot of it

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.180 align:middle line:90%
has to do with osmotic forces.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.250 align:middle line:84%
People remember
osmosis and basically

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:90%
tissue pressure gradients.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And some of this
fluid will bleed off

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.692 align:middle line:84%
into the interstitial
pressure because the pressure

00:41:44.692 --> 00:41:46.650 align:middle line:84%
inside the vessels is
greater than the pressure

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.608 align:middle line:84%
outside the vessels and
there's some bleed-off,

00:41:48.608 --> 00:41:49.630 align:middle line:90%
some loss of fluid.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.972 align:middle line:84%
Well, that fluid doesn't
jump back into your veins.

00:41:51.972 --> 00:41:52.930 align:middle line:90%
It has to go somewhere.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why some
people get edema.

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They'll get swelling
in their ankles

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and swelling in different
parts of their bodies.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, where does that fluid go?

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.219 align:middle line:90%
Does it just disappear?

00:42:01.219 --> 00:42:02.510 align:middle line:90%
It goes into your lymph system.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:05.272 align:middle line:84%
So your lymph system
is a system of vessels.

00:42:05.272 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:84%
There's different
components there,

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:84%
but your lymph
system is a system

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.890 align:middle line:90%
that's kind of like vessels.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.270 align:middle line:84%
That don't have muscular
walls like big arteries.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.060 align:middle line:84%
But the lymph system
grabs this fluid

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.227 align:middle line:84%
and then returns it
back into the system,

00:42:17.227 --> 00:42:18.810 align:middle line:84%
ultimately back into
the venous system

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.700 align:middle line:84%
through a large
duct in your chest

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.350 align:middle line:90%
called your thoracic duct.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:25.512 align:middle line:84%
But this extra fluid
that sort of bleeds out

00:42:25.512 --> 00:42:26.970 align:middle line:84%
through these
capillaries will then

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:28.140 align:middle line:90%
feed back into that system.

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.240 align:middle line:84%
It also passes through
other parts of your body,

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.530 align:middle line:90%
including your spleen--

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's also sort
of considered part

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.200 align:middle line:90%
of your lymphatic system--

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:84%
your thymus, your tonsils,
and your adenoids,

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.360 align:middle line:84%
what a lot of people
have removed as a child.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:84%
There's lymph tissue
or there's lymphocytes

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and those lymphocytes recognize
pathogens, viruses, bacteria,

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:50.700 align:middle line:84%
or things that are
considered non-self.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And your body builds immunity
through those lymphocytes,

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.040 align:middle line:84%
which is what's effective
when someone has

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.387 align:middle line:90%
an immune deficiency disorder.

00:42:57.387 --> 00:42:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Whether you believe in
the HIV virus or not,

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.540 align:middle line:84%
there are certainly immune
deficiency orders disorders.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And T4 cells and helper cells,
different classes of cells

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.130 align:middle line:84%
are affected when the
immune system falters.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
little soldiers

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.980 align:middle line:84%
that are facing these
pathogens, these bacteria,

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.242 align:middle line:84%
these androgens, toxins
even as they pass

00:43:17.242 --> 00:43:18.450 align:middle line:90%
through the lymphatic system.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.840 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of kind of like
your oil filter, I guess.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.950 align:middle line:84%
They're filtering out
some of the nasty stuff.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So the reason jumping
on a trampoline

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.470 align:middle line:84%
is useful is because
your lymphatic system,

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.540 align:middle line:84%
unlike other parts
like your muscles

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and your heart or
your skeletal muscle,

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.770 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have a
muscle wrapped around.

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Like arteries have muscle in
them called a tunica media.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It's what helps
vascular changes.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.560 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
change the pressure

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.930 align:middle line:84%
by those muscles clamping
down or letting go.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, the lymphatic system
doesn't have that ability

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:84%
so it depends on the skeletal
muscles for that return.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.540 align:middle line:84%
So by compressing your thighs
by just simply walking,

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.810 align:middle line:84%
you're actually pushing
lymph through your body.

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:03.320 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of passively pushed
through by the other muscles

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.120 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.597 align:middle line:84%
And so by hopping
on a trampoline,

00:44:05.597 --> 00:44:07.680 align:middle line:84%
you're basically forcing
those muscles to contract

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and you're helping
that drainage.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Instead of having it
collect in your ankles,

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
like you see people
with swollen ankles,

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.568 align:middle line:84%
you're helping some
of that return.

00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when people
start having problems

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.330 align:middle line:84%
with blood pressure
and their heart,

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:20.012 align:middle line:84%
they sometimes will
get swollen ankles

00:44:20.012 --> 00:44:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because that big
pressure differential is

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.500 align:middle line:84%
pushing all that fluid out
into their interstitial tissues

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and their lymph system can't
keep up, especially if they're

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:27.000 align:middle line:90%
sedentary.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.660 align:middle line:84%
If they're sitting
around they're sick,

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.800 align:middle line:90%
they have cardio--

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.630 align:middle line:84%
congestive heart
failure and their heart

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.761 align:middle line:84%
has poor return so
they get dizzy quickly,

00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:84%
they're not going to be able
to get up and walk around

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to help push that lymph back
into their venous system.

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And so a healthy person can
just constantly contract

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.300 align:middle line:84%
their muscles and
keep that going.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.300 align:middle line:84%
That constant activity
is what also helps you

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.394 align:middle line:84%
from getting deep
vein thrombosis.

00:44:52.394 --> 00:44:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
who he was, there

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:84%
was a reporter who was embedded
in either Afghanistan or Iraq.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.900 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of curled up in
a ball and got dehydrated.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.810 align:middle line:84%
He got DVTs because
of inactivity

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.330 align:middle line:84%
because he wasn't walking
around and that clot was thrown

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:05.960 align:middle line:90%
to his heart and he died.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:06.950 align:middle line:90%
He was 44 years old--

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:08.949 align:middle line:84%
I know he was in his early
40s when it happened.

00:45:08.949 --> 00:45:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Very unusual, but again,
inactivity is bad for you.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:15.209 align:middle line:84%
And the converse
is true, I think,

00:45:15.209 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:90%
activity is good for you.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that
specific form of exercise

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:23.750 align:middle line:84%
helps assist the lymphatic
system in returning that fluid

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:24.980 align:middle line:90%
back to the venous system.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>> What a fantastic explanation
of the lymphatic system from

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Sahni.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.165 align:middle line:84%
While I was asking
him questions,

00:45:30.165 --> 00:45:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get his
input on the effect

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.910 align:middle line:84%
that heat has on cancer
cells, specifically far

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:36.440 align:middle line:90%
infrared saunas.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And I also got the input
of Dr. Tony Jimenez, who

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.930 align:middle line:84%
leads the Hope for Cancer
Clinic in Tijuana, Mexico,

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:43.190 align:middle line:90%
on the same issue.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.094 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sahni, talk about
far infrared saunas.

00:45:45.094 --> 00:45:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're a big
proponent of far infrareds.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Talk about the effect that
this can have on cancer.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So far infrared saunas, the
way they work is relatively

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.440 align:middle line:90%
simple.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.420 align:middle line:10%
They exploit or take
advantage of a portion

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:05.180 align:middle line:10%
of the electromagnetic spectrum
that basically increases

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.430 align:middle line:10%
the temperature of the
body, creates hypothermia,

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.380 align:middle line:10%
without exposing
the body to some

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.470 align:middle line:10%
of the negative portion of
the spectrum, which we knew

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:13.910 align:middle line:10%
is the ultraviolet spectrum.

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Go out in the sun too much,
you can get skin cancer,

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:18.500 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
don't wear sunscreen

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.120 align:middle line:90%
and you're light complected.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So far infrared
sauna takes a part

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.360 align:middle line:84%
of that spectrum
that creates heat,

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.600 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily
damage in the way

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.730 align:middle line:90%
that being out in the sun does.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I think the American
Indians and people

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:38.060 align:middle line:84%
who were doing these
more ritualistic heat

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.390 align:middle line:84%
treatments on themselves long
before far infrared saunas were

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:44.034 align:middle line:84%
around, maybe they
didn't understand

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:46.200 align:middle line:84%
the science behind it, but
they it was good for you.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:51.527 align:middle line:84%
But basically what it does is
it raises your body temperature

00:46:51.527 --> 00:46:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and then your body has
to release that heat.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.880 align:middle line:84%
The way we release our
heat is by sweating.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And the sweat helps carry
the heat away from the body.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So by stimulating
that mechanism,

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:05.780 align:middle line:84%
people don't realize this, but
you excrete just as much urea

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.822 align:middle line:90%
through your skin right--

00:47:06.822 --> 00:47:09.196 align:middle line:84%
maybe more, I'd have to go
back and look at the numbers--

00:47:09.196 --> 00:47:10.677 align:middle line:84%
but a significant
amount of toxins

00:47:10.677 --> 00:47:12.260 align:middle line:84%
are excreted through
your skin as they

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.770 align:middle line:84%
are in your urine or your stool
and in some cases probably

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.180 align:middle line:90%
specific toxins even more.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:22.145 align:middle line:84%
And so by exposing yourself
to a reasonable time

00:47:22.145 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:84%
frame and a reasonable
level, a safe level of heat,

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.300 align:middle line:84%
you can just basically
stimulate your body

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.120 align:middle line:84%
to sort of accelerate
that excretion of toxins

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and you can make
that happen faster.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:34.460 align:middle line:84%
The other reason a far
infrared sauna is so useful

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:38.150 align:middle line:84%
is that normal cells are
able to withstand heat

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.810 align:middle line:84%
because of their
normal anatomy compared

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to the abnormal anatomy
of, say, a cancer cell,

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.180 align:middle line:84%
especially in relation
to its vascular supply.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And so a cancer
cell doesn't do well

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:52.310 align:middle line:90%
in a hypothermic situation.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And this has been shown
in mainstream science

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.430 align:middle line:90%
to be the case.

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:59.435 align:middle line:84%
And so by exposing
your body to that heat,

00:47:59.435 --> 00:48:04.100 align:middle line:84%
you're selectively
killing or eradicating

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.790 align:middle line:84%
those less viable cells,
those cancer cells,

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:09.780 align:middle line:84%
without hurting
your normal cells.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And so a far infrared
sauna is useful

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:16.410 align:middle line:84%
because it can help you
sweat, excrete toxins,

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and in theory eliminate
cancer cells which

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.810 align:middle line:84%
can't survive the heat as
well as the normal cells.

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a question
for you on hypothermia.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Hypothermia means that you
superheat the body, right?

00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Why is that effective
at treating cancer?

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:41.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Cancers cells
are heat sensitive.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:45.210 align:middle line:10%
Normal human cells
are heat resistant.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:48.300 align:middle line:10%
That's why when you and I
get a flu or an infection,

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:10%
our temperature
increases as a mechanism

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.510 align:middle line:10%
to get rid of that
pathogen, whether it's

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:56.430 align:middle line:10%
a virus or a bacteria.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But the healthy
cells are not being

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.860 align:middle line:84%
killed because normal
cells are heat resistant.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells are very
fragile to temperature.

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe that we need
to get the body temperature up

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:11.830 align:middle line:90%
to 106, 107 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:16.080 align:middle line:84%
That's just too tough and
it's causing red blood cell

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:16.980 align:middle line:90%
destruction.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, you have to give
the patient a blood transfusion.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:24.600 align:middle line:84%
We get the oral body temperature
up to about 101.4 degrees

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Fahrenheit, knowing
that at the core

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.750 align:middle line:84%
it's probably 1.5 to
two degrees higher.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:34.500 align:middle line:10%
So we're getting to about
103 degrees Fahrenheit, which

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.400 align:middle line:10%
is a very good temperature
to cause that cancer killing

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.220 align:middle line:10%
effect of these cells
that are heat sensitive.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the heat damages them
but doesn't hurt the normal

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:47.730 align:middle line:90%
cells that are heat resistant.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So cancer cells don't survive
heat as well as normal cells.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like this should
be part of everyone's

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.650 align:middle line:90%
detoxification regimen.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I've saved the best for last.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Darrell Wolfe,
the doc of detox,

00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:02.460 align:middle line:84%
gives you specifics
about the order

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:06.060 align:middle line:84%
by which you can cleanse your
entire body, a full body detox.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.220 align:middle line:10%
You've written a book
called "Spoiled Rotten,"

00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:11.580 align:middle line:10%
and in that book, you go
through the order by which you

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:13.680 align:middle line:10%
should cleanse the organs.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.580 align:middle line:10%
So go through that in
three or four minutes.

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:17.130 align:middle line:10%
Go through the
order that someone

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:20.880 align:middle line:10%
will need to go through in order
to detoxify their whole body

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:21.910 align:middle line:10%
organ by organ.

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:22.710 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.984 align:middle line:10%
So when people usually ask me
this question, they go, well,

00:50:25.984 --> 00:50:27.150 align:middle line:10%
what should I cleanse first?

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:10%
And I say, well, what
sticks out the most?

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Tummy.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.300 align:middle line:10%
>> So that would be
the first, thing?

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.220 align:middle line:10%
>> So that would be
your large intestine.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.740 align:middle line:10%
So the first thing
you want to do

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.440 align:middle line:10%
is if you clean out
the large intestine,

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.760 align:middle line:10%
then right away you're going
to reduce the toxic load on all

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.140 align:middle line:10%
the other organs.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.840 align:middle line:84%
If you request any
of the other organs

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.664 align:middle line:84%
to detoxify before you
do the large intestine,

00:50:51.664 --> 00:50:53.580 align:middle line:84%
then what you'll do is
you'll start backing up

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.010 align:middle line:84%
into the bloodstream
or you will even

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:58.260 align:middle line:84%
cause further stress
to that organ itself

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.180 align:middle line:84%
or the other organs if
they happen to be weak.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So the large intestine would
be the first place to go.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like this, we
always work from the bottom up.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.850 align:middle line:84%
So we want to do the
large intestine first.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:14.040 align:middle line:10%
And of course, then the
next thing that I would do

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.260 align:middle line:10%
is the liver.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And then after
the liver, then we

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:20.160 align:middle line:84%
would be looking at
doing the kidneys.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And by doing those
three major organs,

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:24.360 align:middle line:84%
you're already working
on your lymph system,

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.030 align:middle line:84%
you're already
working on your skin.

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
three major ones

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that I would tell people to do
would be the colon, the liver,

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and the kidneys.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.100 align:middle line:10%
And if you work on those
three, then the rest

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.670 align:middle line:10%
come along for the ride.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:40.470 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:42.470 align:middle line:10%
>> So one of the things
that I've heard from any

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:45.990 align:middle line:10%
of the interviewees is coffee
enemas are great for the liver

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.890 align:middle line:10%
detox.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.690 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:49.600 align:middle line:10%
So that's one way
to detox the liver.

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.750 align:middle line:10%
Any other suggestions
on liver detoxification?

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, if I can
just say the coffee

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:56.340 align:middle line:10%
enemas are absolutely
great for the liver.

00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.720 align:middle line:10%
And they were great for the
liver for the medical system

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.230 align:middle line:10%
up until I think probably
about 15, 20 years ago

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:06.250 align:middle line:10%
and then they weren't
great for them anymore.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.100 align:middle line:90%
But they're still great.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is they
help to trigger the liver

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:15.060 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of that sludge that
usually would not come out.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:15.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing is to
do like a gallbladder flush.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:21.300 align:middle line:90%
That's another great thing.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> What natural substances
might be used to flush the gall?

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there's different ones.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But in that sometimes
Epsom salts is used,

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.840 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's olive
oil that's used.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's to basically
make the organs contract.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:38.700 align:middle line:10%
So the other thing, too, is
when you go into a detox,

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:42.390 align:middle line:10%
a lot of people get scared when
they feel pain in an organ.

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:44.640 align:middle line:84%
That's when you need to
breathe and just relax.

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Because that pain that
usually you would be feeling

00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.070 align:middle line:84%
is actually your organ
contracting and going

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:51.180 align:middle line:90%
into spasm.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:53.670 align:middle line:84%
That spasm is the only way
that it can get rid of it.

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:56.605 align:middle line:90%
Because it goes, out, out, out.

00:52:56.605 --> 00:52:58.980 align:middle line:10%
So that's one thing I think
is really important that when

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.310 align:middle line:10%
people start to detox and
when they start detoxifying

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.290 align:middle line:10%
the colon and they
start getting gas cramps

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:08.940 align:middle line:10%
or they feel nausea, that's
the old waste loosening up.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.800 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes when
you start your detox,

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.170 align:middle line:10%
you might have diarrhea.

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:15.720 align:middle line:10%
And if you start
to get diarrhea,

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:17.490 align:middle line:10%
if it lasts for more
than a day, then you

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.890 align:middle line:10%
want to back off
on that cleanse.

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:24.476 align:middle line:10%
But even diarrhea for
the day is not dangerous.

00:53:24.476 --> 00:53:26.850 align:middle line:10%
And you may get diarrhea from
a liver cleanse or a kidney

00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:30.750 align:middle line:10%
cleanse because everything
is getting dumped to come out

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.850 align:middle line:10%
through that main portal.

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:10%
So don't let that scare you.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:37.680 align:middle line:10%
And like I said,
diarrhea won't kill you.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.580 align:middle line:84%
It might make you feel
a little bit weak,

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:40.930 align:middle line:84%
so we don't want it
to last too long.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go to the
kidneys real quick.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about
the liver, the gall.

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:84%
We know there's many
good colon flushes,

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.127 align:middle line:84%
you've talked about
the Master Cleanse tea.

00:53:48.127 --> 00:53:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to kidneys.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.293 align:middle line:90%
How do you detoxify the kidneys?

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:55.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Hulda Clark has a
herbal kidney cleanse that I

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:56.610 align:middle line:10%
really like.

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:57.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It takes about three
weeks to do it.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:06.480 align:middle line:10%
Because the kidneys, they don't
react as fast in cleansing.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.040 align:middle line:10%
They take more work and effort.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:13.260 align:middle line:10%
Just like when somebody says,
I've got kidney disease,

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.500 align:middle line:10%
unless they're really going
to pull their socks up,

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.240 align:middle line:10%
it's already too late.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.970 align:middle line:10%
So your kidneys have to take
a real beating before they

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:22.890 align:middle line:10%
get into that kind of trouble.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:25.500 align:middle line:10%
But doing a kidney cleanse
even once a year is

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:30.210 align:middle line:10%
a really wonderful thing because
your kidneys do so much work.

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:32.064 align:middle line:10%
And they're more silent.

00:54:32.064 --> 00:54:33.480 align:middle line:84%
They're more silent
than the liver

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and they're more silent
than the colon is.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.720 align:middle line:90%
They just are.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.710 align:middle line:10%
But a lot of times lower
back pain, pelvic pain,

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:46.080 align:middle line:10%
pelvic girdle, hip
pain, that is usually

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.387 align:middle line:10%
a sign that the kidneys
are overburdened.

00:54:48.387 --> 00:54:50.970 align:middle line:10%
>> And what might be a substance
that someone could use to get

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:53.370 align:middle line:10%
rid of the toxins
in the kidneys?

00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:59.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, even just doing six to
seven days of just watermelon

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.490 align:middle line:10%
will even help.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:03.480 align:middle line:10%
But there are many
different herbal tinctures

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.725 align:middle line:10%
that you can go and find.

00:55:04.725 --> 00:55:06.600 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of really
good kidney cleanses.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:08.490 align:middle line:10%
That's a common one
that I read about is

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.720 align:middle line:10%
watermelon for the kidneys.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.190 align:middle line:10%
I try to do that every year.

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:15.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is a specific order
to detoxify your body and Dr.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Wolfe, the doc of detox, just
shared it with us in a very

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:19.824 align:middle line:90%
understandable manner.

00:55:19.824 --> 00:55:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to
what he has to say

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.900 align:middle line:90%
as we conclude this episode.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you notice how
every group has an icon,

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.380 align:middle line:84%
like a figure that
they look up to, right?

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:30.620 align:middle line:84%
For the medical system,
what's their icon?

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Their icon is Hippocrates.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.825 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates was the
father of medicine.

00:55:34.825 --> 00:55:37.074 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind, I'd
like to read this because I

00:55:37.074 --> 00:55:38.560 align:middle line:90%
don't want to get it wrong.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So their leader,
who they look up

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to because they took the
Hippocratic oath, right?

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:47.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:51.080 align:middle line:90%
This is what they look up to.

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Let food by thy medicine
and medicine be thy food.

00:55:54.170 --> 00:55:56.730 align:middle line:90%


00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:57.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:00.350 align:middle line:90%
They don't talk about diet.

00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
root of all life.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So right there,
they fail greatly.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Make a habit of two things, to
help or at least do no harm.

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:16.707 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we've
got a war on cancer.

00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:18.290 align:middle line:84%
You can't go to war
with anything, Ty.

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:20.450 align:middle line:90%
You want to go to war with me?

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:22.490 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>> We both die.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.390 align:middle line:84%
Next thing, natural
forces within us

00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:32.150 align:middle line:90%
are the true healers of disease.

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:34.887 align:middle line:90%
So where have they forgotten?

00:56:34.887 --> 00:56:35.720 align:middle line:90%
They have forgotten.

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.790 align:middle line:84%
I haven't forgotten,
you haven't forgotten.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So we must go within
and we must understand

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:45.470 align:middle line:84%
something, that nobody's
going to save your butt, Ty.

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:48.240 align:middle line:84%
When you got that body and you
came down here on that planet,

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.380 align:middle line:84%
you made a promise
to somewhere, somehow

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.580 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to
respect and love your body

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and you were going to
make the decisions.

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Every decision, OK,
has a consequence

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and it can be
either good or bad.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, do you let somebody else
look after your finances, Ty?

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Well why would you let someone
else look after your body?

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:12.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.560 align:middle line:84%
One last thing that
Hippocrates stated,

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:18.680 align:middle line:84%
whenever a doctor
cannot do good,

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:22.220 align:middle line:90%
he must be kept from doing harm.

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:25.870 align:middle line:90%


00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:28.870 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
Hippocratic oath?

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:32.630 align:middle line:84%
I think the only thing that's
left is called the hypocrite.

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:34.810 align:middle line:90%
What an amazing episode, folks.

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Tonight we learned
specifics on how

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:39.280 align:middle line:84%
you can get rid of the
trash from your body, how

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.419 align:middle line:90%
you can detoxify.

00:57:41.419 --> 00:57:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's toxicities
in a lot of things.

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.710 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
a lot of medicines

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:46.010 align:middle line:90%
have toxicities in them?

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever looked
at commercials on TV

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:50.254 align:middle line:84%
and seen the list
of side effects?

00:57:50.254 --> 00:57:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes it's more
than half the commercial

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.086 align:middle line:84%
listing the side
effects of these drugs.

00:57:54.086 --> 00:57:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's an example
to me of people

00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:59.170 align:middle line:84%
that are looking in the
wrong place for answers.

00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Drugs don't cure.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.719 align:middle line:84%
They mitigate symptoms,
but they don't cure.

00:58:03.719 --> 00:58:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you have
a headache, is it

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.580 align:middle line:84%
because you have a lack
of Advil in your system?

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:08.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.030 align:middle line:84%
You've got other things that
are going on in your body.

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:13.540 align:middle line:84%
This reminds me of a time
about three or four years ago

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.206 align:middle line:84%
that I was in West Virginia with
a friend of mine who's actually

00:58:16.206 --> 00:58:18.670 align:middle line:84%
a medical doctor, but
he's also a medicine man

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:20.230 align:middle line:90%
for an Indian tribe.

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And he took me
through the forest.

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:25.780 align:middle line:84%
He asked me to list
anything that I could see,

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:30.280 align:middle line:84%
whether it be trees or bark
or herbs or weeds, anything

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that was growing that
wasn't medicinal.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.981 align:middle line:84%
And I started
pointing out things.

00:58:33.981 --> 00:58:35.230 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no, you're wrong.

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:36.730 align:middle line:84%
That does have this
medicinal effect

00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:38.110 align:middle line:90%
or that medicinal effect.

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, I learned that
everything that was growing

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.880 align:middle line:90%
was medicine.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.580 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole pharmacy right
there in the middle of nature.

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.149 align:middle line:90%
It was nature's pharmacy.

00:58:47.149 --> 00:58:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going to
learn about tomorrow, nature's

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:52.090 align:middle line:84%
pharmacy, the way that
everything that we need

00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:53.110 align:middle line:90%
is growing in nature.

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:55.690 align:middle line:84%
All the medicines that we
need are natural medicines

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:57.716 align:middle line:84%
and they're growing
out there just for you.

00:58:57.716 --> 00:58:59.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to teach
you about that tomorrow.

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's not
surprising that all of nature

00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:04.840 align:middle line:84%
is a pharmacy in light of the
fact that between 70% and 80%

00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.090 align:middle line:84%
of every prescription
drug has it's basis where,

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:11.480 align:middle line:90%
in plants and herbs.

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense to me.

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it will make sense
to you, too, tomorrow night.

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:15.370 align:middle line:90%
So please tune in.

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:17.866 align:middle line:84%
The meantime, have a great
evening and God bless you.

00:59:17.866 --> 00:59:20.296 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:59:20.296 --> 00:59:28.580 align:middle line:90%


00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I was diagnosed with prostate
cancer 10 years ago and I had

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:35.380 align:middle line:10%
the fear of death put
into me by the urologist.

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:38.470 align:middle line:10%
And he had a bedside
manner of a Neanderthal

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.450 align:middle line:10%
as far as I was concerned.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:43.000 align:middle line:10%
And it prompted me to
study natural medicine.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.270 align:middle line:10%
When the doctor tells
you you've got cancer

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:50.560 align:middle line:10%
and he says it just
like that, there's two

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.160 align:middle line:10%
things you know about cancer.

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.690 align:middle line:10%
One is you're going to die
and you're going to die soon.

00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:58.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the average person's
view of having somebody

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.410 align:middle line:90%
say that you've got cancer.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:04.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's the most
irresponsible thing

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:06.395 align:middle line:10%
that a doctor can
do, particularly

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:08.020 align:middle line:10%
with prostate cancer
because you're not

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:12.010 align:middle line:10%
going to die tomorrow or the
next day or the next month

01:00:12.010 --> 01:00:14.780 align:middle line:10%
or perhaps even the
next year or two.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.140 align:middle line:10%
But if you have
conventional treatment,

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:21.700 align:middle line:10%
the potential for you living
with impotence, incontinence,

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.990 align:middle line:10%
and the cancer coming back more
vigorously than it was there

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:28.240 align:middle line:10%
in the first place
are pretty damn good.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.540 align:middle line:10%
Look at the statistics.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.150 align:middle line:10%
It's not me that's saying this.

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:34.130 align:middle line:10%
These are statistics
that can be studied.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.210 align:middle line:10%
So when you figure that out and
you look at them and you go,

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:39.580 align:middle line:10%
wow.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:40.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying my life.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I better look at something else.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I better figure
out a better way.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
you start studying.

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be amazed at how
conventional medicine will

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.800 align:middle line:90%
fight you every bit of the way.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.320 align:middle line:10%
By all intents and purposes, I
mean, I've been here 10 years

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.200 align:middle line:10%
now supposedly with cancer.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But I've been cancer-free
probably five or six years.

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:05.300 align:middle line:10%
It's a privilege.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.640 align:middle line:10%
I honestly believe that
me getting prostate cancer

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.320 align:middle line:10%
was a blessing.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.300 align:middle line:10%
And I don't necessarily mean
that in a religious world.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.970 align:middle line:10%
But if it works, then it
was a religious blessing,

01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:17.290 align:middle line:10%
if you like.

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:21.400 align:middle line:10%
But it was a calling for me
to do something different.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.400 align:middle line:10%
And later on because of my
ability to make documentaries,

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.930 align:middle line:10%
it was a calling to do that.

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:28.580 align:middle line:10%
We are overtreated,
we're overdiagnosed,

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.000 align:middle line:10%
we're overtested.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.870 align:middle line:10%
What were not told how to
live our lives to avoid some

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:37.250 align:middle line:10%
of these problems and
if we have the problems,

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:39.910 align:middle line:10%
how to live our lives to
live through the problems

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:44.230 align:middle line:10%
and get better, how to
manage the body, how to eat,

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:46.630 align:middle line:10%
how to talk, how to
think, how to get

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:51.340 align:middle line:10%
rid of stress, how to resolve
emotional traumas in our life

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.920 align:middle line:10%
so they're not a taxation
on our immune system.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.380 align:middle line:10%
Nobody's teaching that.

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.780 align:middle line:10%
When you go to the urologist,
he hasn't got a clue

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:02.430 align:middle line:10%
about those things.

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:07.760 align:middle line:10%
All he knows is I'm a surgeon,
I cut, I take your prostate out.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.590 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't resolve anything.

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:13.060 align:middle line:10%
All it takes out is
prostate and the tumor.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.900 align:middle line:10%
And then if the cancer
comes back they say,

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.710 align:middle line:10%
well, obviously we
didn't get it all.

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:19.220 align:middle line:10%
No.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:21.970 align:middle line:10%
The problem is that the
cause is still there,

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:24.820 align:middle line:10%
and the cause will create
cancer somewhere else.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.690 align:middle line:10%
If there's no prostate
that create it in,

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:29.080 align:middle line:10%
it will create it
somewhere else.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot in my
life outside of this.

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.340 align:middle line:10%
I've made lots of
documentary films,

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.230 align:middle line:10%
I've done a lot of
television shows,

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:37.540 align:middle line:10%
I was a stunt man for 10
years in movies like "Batman

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.370 align:middle line:10%
and Robin" and "Apollo 13."

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:41.440 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I've done a lot.

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm just grateful that
this stage of my life I

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.580 align:middle line:10%
have a purpose, and
the purpose appears

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.990 align:middle line:10%
to be coming to me to do this.

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:50.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty grateful for that.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't have
any purpose in their life.

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:57.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm grateful for
having that purpose.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.501 align:middle line:10%
You see the smile on their
face or I've had phone calls

01:03:00.501 --> 01:03:01.750 align:middle line:10%
from people saying, thank you.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:03.650 align:middle line:10%
You've saved my life.

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:06.390 align:middle line:10%
I've actually had phone
calls where people say that.

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:11.020 align:middle line:10%
That's pretty damn powerful
stuff on any plane.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I talk to
a lot of doctors.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.770 align:middle line:10%
I've changed the minds
of a lot of doctors

01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:18.610 align:middle line:10%
that had no idea of
the research that

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:21.130 align:middle line:10%
is out there that's been
done that they never

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.850 align:middle line:10%
get taught in medical school.

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:25.690 align:middle line:10%
I lost my father to the
treatment for prostate cancer--

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:27.242 align:middle line:10%
not the disease, the treatment.

01:03:27.242 --> 01:03:28.700 align:middle line:10%
But what was more
of an emotion was

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:32.320 align:middle line:10%
when I started to study prostate
cancer when I had it and found

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.310 align:middle line:10%
out that he'd been killed by
the treatment, not the disease.

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:39.640 align:middle line:10%
He could have had 10, 15
more years on his life.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.240 align:middle line:10%
If you realize that the
standard of care for his day

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.830 align:middle line:10%
was a drug that killed him,
rather than the understanding

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:53.370 align:middle line:10%
that prostate cancer can
be lived with and managed.

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:59.000 align:middle line:10%
I was pretty pissed off
because the doctors of the day

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.840 align:middle line:10%
had no indication, no
inclination about looking

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.210 align:middle line:10%
beyond what they
were told to do,

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:07.952 align:middle line:10%
which was you've got this
disease, you get this drug.

01:04:07.952 --> 01:04:09.410 align:middle line:10%
You've got to
understand the thing.

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:11.750 align:middle line:10%
The drug of that day
that they gave my father

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:13.780 align:middle line:10%
was a drug called flutamide.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:17.240 align:middle line:10%
Flutamide is an androgen
deprivation drug.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.080 align:middle line:10%
It kills testosterone.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.780 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have
testosterone in your body,

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:27.850 align:middle line:10%
your bones shrink and will
break and your muscles collapse.

01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:30.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, what's one of the
biggest muscles in your body?

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.600 align:middle line:10%
Your heart.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.400 align:middle line:10%
OK?

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.510 align:middle line:10%
Without testosterone, your
heart will stop, you will die.

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.380 align:middle line:10%
You don't die of
prostate cancer,

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.760 align:middle line:10%
you die from the
results of the drug

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.710 align:middle line:10%
they're giving you that kills
testosterone in your body.

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:47.170 align:middle line:10%
It prevents your
body from naturally

01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:52.850 align:middle line:10%
making the testosterone that it
needs to support your own life.

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:56.000 align:middle line:10%
But he missed out on his life.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.050 align:middle line:10%
That's the issue.

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:58.410 align:middle line:10%
And they call them side effects.

01:04:58.410 --> 01:04:59.210 align:middle line:10%
No.

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:03.020 align:middle line:10%
They're not side effects,
they're direct effects.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:05.120 align:middle line:10%
My father dying
was a direct effect

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.290 align:middle line:10%
of him taking that drug, not
some sort of willy-nilly side

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:10.544 align:middle line:10%
effect.

01:05:10.544 --> 01:05:11.960 align:middle line:10%
If he hadn't ever
taken that drug,

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.600 align:middle line:10%
he would not have died
of that heart attack.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:19.920 align:middle line:10%
And on his death certificate,
it says myocardiac infarction.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:23.605 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't say death from
the drug of prostate cancer.

01:05:23.605 --> 01:05:24.880 align:middle line:10%
>> It should?

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course it should.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:28.678 align:middle line:10%
It's incredibly dishonest.

01:05:28.678 --> 01:05:30.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you feel that's dishonest?

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I certainly do.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.710 align:middle line:10%
Because instead of
it being a statistic

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:39.907 align:middle line:10%
of dying of flutamide, it just
says myocardiac infarction.

01:05:39.907 --> 01:05:41.490 align:middle line:10%
What the hell do
they learn from that?

01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:43.560 align:middle line:10%
Nothing.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.560 align:middle line:10%
He died from the
drug that he was

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.770 align:middle line:10%
being made to take by
his doctor because that

01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:51.728 align:middle line:10%
was the standard of
care in that day.

01:05:51.728 --> 01:05:55.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Your dad wasn't
ready to go, was he?

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:57.310 align:middle line:10%
>> One assumes not.

01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:58.992 align:middle line:10%
Well, who of us is?

01:05:58.992 --> 01:06:00.450 align:middle line:10%
Because we're not
getting the truth

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:03.360 align:middle line:10%
from conventional medicine.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.010 align:middle line:10%
We're just not.

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:07.290 align:middle line:10%
So any organization,
whether it calls

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:10.170 align:middle line:10%
itself the Truth about
Cancer, which is a great title

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:14.190 align:middle line:10%
or whether it's my small
organization, which

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:16.500 align:middle line:10%
is Healing Arts
Education Foundation,

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:20.100 align:middle line:10%
we're all in the same game to
help people understand what

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.750 align:middle line:10%
it is that's making
this medical world tick

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:27.520 align:middle line:10%
and how to really get around the
pitfalls of particularly cancer

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.320 align:middle line:10%
treatment.
