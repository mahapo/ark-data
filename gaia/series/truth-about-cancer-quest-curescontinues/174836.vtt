00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:10.868 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:17.547 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.547 --> 00:00:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back, everyone.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that you
decided to join us again

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.032 align:middle line:84%
for another episode of "The
Quest for the Cure Continues."

00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:84%
If you tuned in last
night, and I hope you did,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.517 align:middle line:84%
you learned a lot about
diagnostics for cancer,

00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:84%
which ones are good and
which ones aren't so good,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.685 align:middle line:84%
and you began to learn about
natural treatments for cancer.

00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
If you enjoyed that,
then you're really

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.684 align:middle line:84%
going to enjoy
tonight's episode,

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
because it's totally dedicated
to natural treatments

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.554 align:middle line:90%
for cancer.

00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:84%
The first interview is with
Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez. .

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:90%
He's a medical doctor.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
He's got an office
in New York City

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and he specializes in pancreatic
enzymes and detoxification,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
as well as a structured
diet to treat cancer.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
He's had tremendous success
with many types of cancer

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that are considered
to be untreatable

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:84%
with conventional oncology,
for instance pancreatic cancer.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.160 align:middle line:84%
it's the equivalent
of a death sentence

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
if you go with
conventional treatments.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't even claim
to have a treatment

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.130 align:middle line:90%
for pancreatic cancer.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.535 align:middle line:84%
Almost no one lives
past five years.

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, Dr. Gonzalez
shared with me

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
a story of one of
his patients that's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:90%
32 years out from diagnosis.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:84%
She was diagnosed 32 years
ago with pancreatic cancer

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.370 align:middle line:90%
and she's still alive.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
She was given the gift of
life because of Dr. Gonzalez's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.300 align:middle line:90%
treatment.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I only wish that maybe I had
known about this treatment

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
back when my father was
diagnosed in 1996 because I

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.390 align:middle line:84%
would have loved to have had
him with me these last 18 years.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately for this lady,
she has been with her family

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.955 align:middle line:84%
for the last 32 years and
they've been able to enjoy her.

00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just so amazing to me these
natural treatments for cancer.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.224 align:middle line:84%
They really work and people
are alive because of them.

00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:84%
It's an encouraging
story and this

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to be an encouraging
episode because you're

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.689 align:middle line:84%
going to see that there is
hope and that cancer doesn't

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.855 align:middle line:90%
have to be a death sentence.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:90%
I hope you enjoy the show.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>Dr. Gonzalez, talk about the
protocol that you're using.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
If you could, go back and
kind of give a few details

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.547 align:middle line:84%
about what protocol
Dr. Kelly was using

00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and then how you've adopted
that into your practice now.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:90%
What are you using?

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Kelly's program and our
program have three basic

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.410 align:middle line:90%
components.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:10%
In our therapy today,
25, 27 years later, it's

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:10%
really a derivation of Kelly.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:84%
We follow his model
pretty closely.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:84%
It involves three
basic components,

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.540 align:middle line:84%
individualized diet,
individualized supplement

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
programs with for cancer
patients large doses

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.040 align:middle line:84%
of pancreatic enzymes and
detoxification routines

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:90%
like coffee enemas.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, unlike a lot of
alternative practitioners

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
who use one diet
for everybody, like

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.225 align:middle line:84%
Atkins thought everyone
should be on a meat diet;

00:02:46.225 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
the Gerson people think
everyone should be vegetarian.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:84%
Kelly realized early
on different people

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
need different diets
and some people do well

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.110 align:middle line:84%
with a plant-based
diet, other patients

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.984 align:middle line:84%
need fatty red meat two
or three times a day.

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
He had a 10 basic dies
and 94 variations.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And investigative journalist
that I was at heart

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.682 align:middle line:84%
when I first met him,
I challenged him.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
He showed me on his
computer the 10 basic diets

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:90%
and 94 variations.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.362 align:middle line:84%
And even then, he would
individualize the diet.

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So he doesn't have,
he didn't have,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:90%
and we don't have one diet.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.164 align:middle line:84%
We follow that traditionally,
we have 10 diets and dozens

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:90%
of variations.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, large doses of
nutritional supplements--

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
vitamins, minerals,
trace elements,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
glandular extracts from animals
like liver, thymus, and lung,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.210 align:middle line:90%
pancreas, heart.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
These glandular products are
made for us in New Zealand.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't believe the
vitamins and minerals,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
trace elements, and
glandular products

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
are going to cure
or reverse cancer.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
What they do provide
is nutritional support.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:84%
We're doing two
things, we're trying

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
to attack the cancer directly
but we're also trying

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.664 align:middle line:90%
to rebuild the ravaged body.

00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:41.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the patients
that came to Kelly

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
patients we see not only

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.299 align:middle line:84%
have advanced cancer,
which just wrecks the body,

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
but also been treated with
aggressive chemo, radiation,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.032 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of combinations
that also ravage the body.

00:03:50.032 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
rebuild the body

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:90%
and also attack the cancer.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And you can attack the cancer
better if you rebuild the body.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.839 align:middle line:84%
So the vitamins,
minerals, trace elements,

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
glandular products help
restore the normal equilibrium

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:90%
and homeostasis of the body.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And even then, the
supplement programs

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:90%
are very individualized.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Kelly did and we
do individualize

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.052 align:middle line:84%
all these supplement programs
so no two patients are

00:04:10.052 --> 00:04:11.260 align:middle line:90%
on exactly the same protocol.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.759 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of them, of
course, are similar.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, in addition to the
vitamins, minerals, trace

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.258 align:middle line:84%
elements, et cetera designed
specifically for each patient,

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.079 align:middle line:84%
we use for cancer patients large
doses of pancreatic enzymes.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was Kelly's
great innovation

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.660 align:middle line:84%
in a tradition we
follow, of course.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, pancreatic
enzymes have been

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.560 align:middle line:84%
known since the 1850s
and 1860s, and they're

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:90%
known as the digestive enzymes.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:84%
They help us break
down proteins, fats,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and carbohydrates.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
In addition, Dr. John Beard
was the great professor

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Edinburgh, English

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
by birth, Scottish
by profession.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:84%
He taught at Edinburgh
all his professional life.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
He was a very brilliant
embryologist, got his doctorate

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.205 align:middle line:84%
in 1884 from the University
of Freiburg in Germany.

00:04:50.205 --> 00:04:51.955 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the
great embryologists.

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
He was a working embryologist
still quoted today

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.450 align:middle line:90%
in the literature.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
But his work in embryology
led him on a side tangent

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.841 align:middle line:84%
into pancreatic
enzymes and cancer.

00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:02.590 align:middle line:84%
He was not trained as
a cancer researcher,

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
but he was a brilliant man
like a lot of brilliant men,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.195 align:middle line:84%
like Linus Pauling,
they become experts

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:07.560 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of different fields.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And in 1902, he wrote
the first paper claiming

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:84%
pancreatic enzymes, in addition
to the digestive capability,

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.585 align:middle line:84%
which had been well
documented by that point,

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
they're the body's main
defense against cancer

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.772 align:middle line:84%
and would be useful
as a cancer treatment.

00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And brilliant man that he
was, he did animal studies.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.410 align:middle line:84%
We think of 110 years ago as
a primitive time in science

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.325 align:middle line:84%
where scientists worked out
of caves with the candles.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.074 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, it was
very sophisticated.

00:05:27.074 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
By 1902, pathologists-- and
Sloan-Kettering already existed

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.540 align:middle line:90%
by that point--

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
brilliant pathologists
in the US and Europe

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
had already evaluated
and diagnosed and defined

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:90%
100 different types of cancer.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.495 align:middle line:84%
They knew what cancer was, they
knew what it looked like, they

00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:43.078 align:middle line:84%
knew how it behaved, they knew
how to examine it and biopsy it

00:05:43.078 --> 00:05:44.680 align:middle line:90%
under the microscope.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So Beard took an animal model,
which they had at that time

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.790 align:middle line:84%
for cancer, and
used its enzymes--

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
it was the first study
of enzymes in history--

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and got 100% regression
of cancer in the animals

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that he treated, whereas
the control group

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:90%
died very quickly.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
He was not a physician,
he was an SCD,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.040 align:middle line:84%
he had a doctorate degree so he
wasn't able to treat patients

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But physicians working under
him began using enzymes.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
The first case was 1905, a
case of head and neck cancer.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The person who administered
it, Dr. Clarence Rice,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.135 align:middle line:84%
had an office about five
blocks from this office

00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:90%
where we're sitting now.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:90%
We're right on Madison Avenue.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:10%
So it's kind of a historic
place to be in terms of enzymes.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.370 align:middle line:10%
And the tumor
completely regressed

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:10%
and it was published in
the conventional medical

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:10%
literature.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
I've collected dozens of
articles in the peer-reviewed

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
conventional literature from
the period 1905 to 1911 where

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
physicians under Beard's
guidance treated advanced

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:90%
cancer--

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
colon cancer, rectal
cancer, breast cancer,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
endometrial cancer,
lung cancer--

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.025 align:middle line:90%
successfully with the enzymes.

00:06:43.025 --> 00:06:45.400 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book in 1911 on
the enzyme treatment of cancer

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.235 align:middle line:84%
where he actually had sequential
photographs of patients

00:06:48.235 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:84%
with head and neck cancer where
the tumors actually disappeared

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and the skin heals
normally 100 years ago,

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:90%
more than 100 years ago.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But the work then,
as it is today,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
was considered
too controversial.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
There was another
footnote which I often

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.000 align:middle line:90%
talk about in my lectures.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
At the same time Beard was
showing that enzymes reverse

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.807 align:middle line:84%
cancer, Madamee Curie,
the great French-- well,

00:07:09.807 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
she was Polish by birth, but she
was working at the University

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:90%
of Paris--

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:90%
she was investigating radiation.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And radiation x-rays had
been discovered in 1895.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
By 1900, they were
used diagnostically

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.955 align:middle line:90%
and they were miraculous.

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:24.246 align:middle line:84%
You do an x-ray and you can
see the inside of the chest

00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:90%
and see the lungs.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.206 align:middle line:84%
By 1905, Madamee
Curie was saying

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that radiation would be a
simple, easy, and non-toxic way

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.900 align:middle line:90%
of treating all cancer.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.792 align:middle line:84%
And she had two
Nobel Prizes already,

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:90%
one of the few people--

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Linus Pauling also had two--

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.460 align:middle line:84%
who had ever won
one, let alone two.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And she was well-loved
by the media.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.574 align:middle line:84%
She was the first
great media star.

00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
She knew how to
use the media, she

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
knew how to hold
press conferences.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And she announced radiation
as the cure to cancer

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.410 align:middle line:90%
to the media.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Beard was this nerdy
ivory tower scientist

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
who thought the media
was a bunch of morons,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
had no use for them,
no use for his critics.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.820 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't maybe the
most diplomatic person.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Madame Curie knew how
to nurture the media.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So all over the world, Madame
Curie the great beloved--

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.765 align:middle line:84%
she was the first woman to get
a PhD in theoretical physics

00:08:05.765 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Paris so she

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.940 align:middle line:84%
had this extraordinary
history and movies

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:90%
have been made about her.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.340 align:middle line:90%
And the press loved her.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Who cared about Dr. Beard
and pancreatic enzymes?

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, nobody, apparently.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:90%
So his book went unheeded.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Radiation came into the
forefront of cancer treatment.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.438 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Madame Curie was
completely wrong on all counts.

00:08:22.438 --> 00:08:23.370 align:middle line:90%
It isn't nontoxic.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she herself died as a
result of radiation exposure.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
She died of aplastic
anemia caused by radiation.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
Most tumors that regress come
back very quickly more deadly.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:36.369 align:middle line:84%
And only a few cancers
actually responded to it,

00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:38.482 align:middle line:84%
so radiation was not the
single easy nontoxic way

00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:90%
of treating all cancer.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:90%
She was wrong.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
But by that point, by the
time scientists realized it,

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:90%
hundreds of them died.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of scientists
involved with radiation

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
died because of their cavalier
exposure to radiation thinking,

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:90%
it's invisible so it's safe.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.580 align:middle line:84%
To answer your
original question,

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.330 align:middle line:84%
the three components,
individualized diet,

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
individualized
supplements, large doses

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.066 align:middle line:90%
of pancreatic enzymes.

00:08:56.066 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The third component
is detoxification,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:84%
which is often the component
of the therapy that

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
elicits the most
grins and mockery

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:90%
from conventional doctors.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's really very simple.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.416 align:middle line:84%
When Kelly was
treating himself, he

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:84%
was taking the
pancreatic enzymes

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:90%
and tumors were breaking down.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he got
really sick, almost

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.782 align:middle line:90%
life-threateningly sick.

00:09:15.782 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
First he thought the enzymes
weren't working anymore,

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:84%
but then he realized the
tumors were shrinking

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.194 align:middle line:90%
and I'm getting sick.

00:09:20.194 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized, I'm
reacting to the tumor waste.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And indeed,
conventional oncologists

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:84%
know today in 2014
that nothing is

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
more toxic to the human
body than dead cancer.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, chemotherapy, though it
doesn't work for most cancers,

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:84%
does work for some
like Hodgkin's

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:90%
and certain leukemias.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.257 align:middle line:84%
And in Hodgkins patients, if
you break a tumor down too fast

00:09:38.257 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:84%
with chemo, you'll kill the
patient from the dead tumor.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And they call that
tumor lysis syndrome.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.504 align:middle line:10%
It's recognized
in the textbooks,

00:09:43.504 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:10%
all my conventional
textbooks talking about it.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.720 align:middle line:10%
Well, Kelly recognized
that back in 1963

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:10%
when he was trying to
get over his own cancer.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And he started going into the
literature, as he always did.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:90%
He was a great scholar.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
He would go into the
literature trying

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.495 align:middle line:84%
to find some technique
that would help his liver

00:09:57.495 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:90%
and kidneys work better.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.795 align:middle line:84%
The liver and the kidney are
the body's main detoxification

00:10:00.795 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:90%
organs.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
That's where
environmental chemicals,

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.890 align:middle line:84%
our own metabolic
waste, and dead cancer

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.629 align:middle line:84%
are processed and neutralize
and prepared for excretion.

00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:09.712 align:middle line:84%
He opens up the "Merck
Manual," and lo and behold,

00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:90%
there are coffee enemas.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing or the
sad thing is, the ironic thing,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.374 align:middle line:84%
Kelly was brutalized
in the media

00:10:15.374 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
for his use of coffee enemas,
and we get attacked about it

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:90%
today, too.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But they come right out of
the conventional medical

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:90%
literature.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.245 align:middle line:84%
He didn't learn about it from
alien space beings wanting

00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:84%
to injecting it into his brain
through some mystic psychic

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
He didn't learn about it through
some alternative throwaway

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.150 align:middle line:90%
journal. or some story.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
He learned it from the
conventional medical textbooks.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.530 align:middle line:84%
The "Merck Manual"
is a compendium

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.721 align:middle line:90%
of conventional therapies.

00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were in
the "Merck Manual."

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.886 align:middle line:84%
Coffee enemas were
in the "Merck Manual"

00:10:38.886 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
right up until the 1970s.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I was doing my
investigation of Kelly,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.700 align:middle line:84%
trained investigative
reporter that I was,

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.533 align:middle line:84%
I called up the editor
of the "Merck Manual"

00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:47.782 align:middle line:90%
then and had a talk with him.

00:10:47.782 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said the only
reason they were taken out

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is we'd get kind of folksy, and
we had all this high tech stuff

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:90%
to use.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And he had files on coffee
enemas which he sent me.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.409 align:middle line:84%
And dozens of studies from
the '20s and 1930s and 1940s

00:10:58.409 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:84%
from major institutions
where they're

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:84%
using coffee enemas for
a variety of things--

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.134 align:middle line:90%
arthritis, mental illness.

00:11:03.134 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a study from the "New
England Journal of Medicine,"

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:84%
the preeminent medical
journal in the US,

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
1932 from Harvard
Medical School,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
a group of research
psychiatrists

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.940 align:middle line:84%
successfully treated what we
today call bipolar illness--

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:84%
in those days, they called it
manic depressive-- with enemas.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And their hypothesis
was that there

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
were toxins in the
intestinal tract that

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.091 align:middle line:84%
were polluting the
mind and that's

00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
what was causing
the mental illness.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
They put these people
on enemas and colonics

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and they got them off medication
and out of the hospital.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:84%
It was in the "New
England Journal,"

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:90%
I have a copy, in 1932.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.135 align:middle line:90%
I have a study from Uruguay.

00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Just because it's
Uruguay doesn't

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:84%
mean they weren't
serious scientists.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
People downplay that
it's not from Boston.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:90%
It was a good study.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
They had patients
with septic shock.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Septic shock occurs because
gram negative bacteria produce

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:84%
a polysaccharide
kind of carbohydrate

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
that's toxic to the human
and people die from that.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
The death rate today is still
in the range of 40% to 50%

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.570 align:middle line:90%
with septic shock.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.920 align:middle line:90%
In those days, it was like 90%.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, these people
in Uruguay in what

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.200 align:middle line:84%
we would call an
intensive care unit today

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
had learned about coffee enemas
from the conventional medical

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.677 align:middle line:84%
world, started treating their
patients with coffee enemas,

00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and had great success
and published it

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:90%
in a peer-reviewed journal.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.836 align:middle line:84%
We have a translation,
it was originally

00:12:13.836 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:90%
published in Spanish.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Almost like 90% reversal
of septic shock.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.430 align:middle line:84%
That should change the way
hospitals treat septic shock

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.230 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.771 align:middle line:84%
It was ignored
because it was folksy,

00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:26.390 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't high tech
even then, 1941-42.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:90%
So we have dozens of articles--

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Kelly collected them,
dozens of articles

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.710 align:middle line:84%
from the mainstream
peer-reviewed

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.001 align:middle line:84%
medical literature discussing
the use of enemas, coffee

00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:84%
enemas, other types of colonics,
and the successful treatment

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.347 align:middle line:90%
of all kinds of illnesses.

00:12:37.347 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So he incorporated them into
his practice and it helped.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And he added other things
like liver flushes and colon

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.896 align:middle line:84%
cleanses and juice fasts
and skin brushing, which

00:12:45.896 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
is an all naturopathic
physicians

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:84%
technique to get the
lymphatics to work better;

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
kidney flushes; all
kinds of techniques

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.820 align:middle line:90%
that we still use today.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I went through over
10,000 of Kelly's records,

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
interviewed over
1,000 of his patients,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:84%
evaluated 455 of his
advanced cancer patients

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
who had done well, evaluated
50 at great length representing

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.864 align:middle line:90%
26 different types of cancer.

00:13:05.864 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of these
patients we actually

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.752 align:middle line:84%
saw in our own immunology
clinic with Dr. Good--

00:13:10.752 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had a film of this--

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
examining these Kelly
patients, writing notes

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.580 align:middle line:84%
in the official hospital
records with his white coat

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.459 align:middle line:90%
and stethoscope.

00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
We put it together
in monograph form.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I did the writing, I did the
research, and he was my mentor.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So I evaluated 50 patients with
26 different types of cancer,

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.180 align:middle line:84%
all poor prognosis or
terminal or advanced,

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:84%
who enjoyed extraordinary
responses that

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
could only be attributed to Dr.
Kelly's nutritional program.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Put this together in monograph
form in 1986, finished

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.570 align:middle line:90%
my immunology fellowship.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:43.814 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have Dr. Good as my
mentor, the most published

00:13:43.814 --> 00:13:45.230 align:middle line:84%
author in the
history of medicine,

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:90%
50 books to his credit.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:84%
He was either editor or
co-writer of 50 books,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.660 align:middle line:90%
over 2,00 papers.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't get it published.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The general response
were one of two.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:84%
First, a lot of the
editors didn't believe it.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have some
letters in my office

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
from editors who
warned Dr. Good this

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.207 align:middle line:84%
had to be a scam,
fraudulent, and I

00:14:03.207 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
had conned him or
something, even

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
though we saw the
patients in our own clinic

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Good knew
they were real.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is editors
would say, this is real,

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
but if it's real it's the
most extraordinary thing

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
in medicine, but
it's also the most

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.034 align:middle line:84%
controversial in
nutritional prostate cancer.

00:14:18.034 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is 1986, where to
mention nutrition and cancer

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
in the same sentence was
tantamount to a felony.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And the editors said, this would
be the end of my publishing

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:90%
career.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The American Cancer Society,
the National Institutes

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.216 align:middle line:84%
of Health, the National
Cancer Institute

00:14:30.216 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:84%
will make sure that I
can't feed my children.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:90%
So they would pass.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:10%
I tried for two years,
couldn't get it published,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:10%
eventually put it away.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But finally in
2010, we published

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.480 align:middle line:84%
it updated, rewritten
with a long introduction

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.504 align:middle line:90%
by me updating it to 2010.

00:14:44.504 --> 00:14:46.795 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that point Dr. Good
was not at Sloan-Kettering,

00:14:46.795 --> 00:14:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I had finished my
immunology fellowship.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
We had a long talk,
went out to dinner,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and he said something
very interesting.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't have it on tape
so I can't confirm it.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
But he said, you know,
some of these cases

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.255 align:middle line:84%
are so extraordinary,
like we had

00:14:59.255 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
a five-year survivor
of pancreatic cancer

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.310 align:middle line:90%
which he'd never seen.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.551 align:middle line:84%
One of his former wives,
he married three times,

00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:08.550 align:middle line:84%
had died of pancreatic
cancer within two months.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And he was president
at of Sloan-Kettering,

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.079 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't save his own wife.

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:12.065 align:middle line:90%
She died quickly.

00:15:12.065 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're
showing me these cases.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.244 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't know
how Kelly's doing this.

00:15:16.244 --> 00:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
anything like this

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.201 align:middle line:84%
and I'm president
of Sloan-Kettering.

00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, people
come from all

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:84%
over the world for my
advice about cancer.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, the whole
Iranian crisis

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:90%
began because of Dr. Good.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
The shah of Iran got
sick so he wanted

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the best physician in the
world to come evaluate him.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So he picked Robert Good,
flew Robert Good in the shah's

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:90%
private jet to Iran.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Good examined and within--
he was a brilliant clinician,

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.561 align:middle line:84%
as well as researcher-- within
10 minutes made the diagnosis,

00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
he says, you've got
gall bladder cancer.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.216 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've got
to come to New York.

00:15:45.216 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
So he came to New York
and New York Hospital,

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the
Iranian revolution began.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I had no idea.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No one knows this at all.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
No one knows that the
Iranian revolution

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:84%
began because of
Robert Good, president

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:90%
of Sloan-Kettering, my mentor.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Kelly himself had
cancer and when

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.403 align:middle line:84%
he was trying to
fight his own battle,

00:16:00.403 --> 00:16:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and he was an
orthodontist by training.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What type of
cancer did he have?

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> He had pancreatic cancer.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, I spoke to his doctor-- so
when I first did my research 30

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.012 align:middle line:90%
years ago, he was still alive.

00:16:10.012 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:90%
They never biopsied it.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:90%
They said he was too unstable.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
bring him to surgery.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And this is before CAT scans.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:90%
This was in the early 1960s.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:90%
But they did x-rays.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:84%
He had tumors in both
lungs, fluid in his lungs,

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.200 align:middle line:90%
a tumor in his hip.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.741 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he always
walked with a limp

00:16:22.741 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:84%
because the tumor had
eaten through his hip bone.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.780 align:middle line:84%
He had a tumor in
his heart, which

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:90%
is rare for pancreatic cancer.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.994 align:middle line:90%
It was in his bone.

00:16:29.994 --> 00:16:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said there was
nothing they could do.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.080 align:middle line:84%
They gave him two
months to live.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And he had four young
kids, all of them adopted.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.204 align:middle line:84%
He had mumps as a teenager and
mumps can make you sterile,

00:16:38.204 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:84%
so he couldn't have kids
so he adopted four kids out

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.301 align:middle line:90%
of the orphanages.

00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was afraid
if he died, they'd

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.008 align:middle line:90%
end up back in the orphanage.

00:16:44.008 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:90%
He said, I can't die.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.000 align:middle line:90%
Kelly was a very determined guy.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.141 align:middle line:84%
He also had an IQ
twice of most of us.

00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm not going to die.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So he went through
the literature

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.504 align:middle line:84%
and realized the only thing he
could do was change his diet.

00:16:55.504 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Then he learned
about Beard's work

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
from at that point like 60
years earlier, added an enzyme

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:90%
and got well.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:90%
And then the local doctors--

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Kelly was very well known
in the town where he lived.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:84%
He lived in Grapevine,
Texas which is suburb--

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.600 align:middle line:84%
as you know, you're
a Texas boy--

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:90%
a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.950 align:middle line:84%
In those days, it was a
pokey professional suburb.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Now it's like Dallas is
taking over the world.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
But it was a pokey
town, Grapevine.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.711 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the country
club and taught Bible study

00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
on Sundays and was in the
church and the school board.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knew him.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:90%
He was in the country club.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors saw him rise
from the dead like Lazarus.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:90%
So they started quietly--

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:84%
this is 1964-65-- sending
their cancer patients to Kelly.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew,
they trusted him.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
He was the same country
club, same church.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So the medical doctors
were sending their patients

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:90%
to a dentist.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And they were
sending to a dentist.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Legally, he didn't have
the right to treat cancer,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:90%
dentists can't.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.584 align:middle line:84%
But they would send them
and they would get well.

00:17:47.584 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
That was the good
news and the bad news.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.625 align:middle line:84%
The good news is word of mouth
network started to spread.

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:55.205 align:middle line:84%
And know someone's cousin in
Houston heard about my cousin

00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
got well, and they
would come to Kelly.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And then it was a
person in New Mexico.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.735 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon, people were coming
from all over the country

00:18:00.735 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
to Kelly's dentist
office outside of Dallas

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.609 align:middle line:90%
and getting well.

00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess what, the medical
board wasn't too happy about it

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.025 align:middle line:84%
because sooner or later,
they heard about it.

00:18:10.025 --> 00:18:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Kelly once told me at one
time, 14 government agencies

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:90%
were investigating him.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:15.836 align:middle line:84%
And investigative
reporter that I am,

00:18:15.836 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I know people tend
to exaggerate.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I looked through
the data and indeed,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.020 align:middle line:84%
14 government agencies from
the local county attorney

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.172 align:middle line:84%
to the state medical board
to the the dental board.

00:18:25.172 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:84%
The dental board actually
took away his license

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.990 align:middle line:84%
for practicing medicine
without a license.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.448 align:middle line:84%
He didn't care
because he just said

00:18:30.448 --> 00:18:33.380 align:middle line:84%
he's doing nutrition, kept
seeing patients anyway.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:84%
The state attorneys, the
attorney state attorney

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:84%
general, federal
attorney, the IRS.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:84%
They all colluded like
going after Tea Party groups

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.818 align:middle line:84%
They colluded to
try and get Kelly.

00:18:41.818 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Here's a guy giving
cancer patients nutrition.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
This isn't like he
committed the Holocaust.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.390 align:middle line:10%
He's just giving patients
with nothing else to do--

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.922 align:middle line:10%
you can't treat
them successfully

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:52.505 align:middle line:10%
with any of this
conventional therapy.

00:18:52.505 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:10%
He's giving them nutrition.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:10%
And lo and behold, the
problem was a lot of them

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:10%
were getting well,
which started to upset

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.141 align:middle line:10%
the medical authorities.

00:18:59.141 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
too, and these

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.014 align:middle line:84%
are stories that
as far as I know

00:19:02.014 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
have never been told
before, at one point

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:84%
he was arrested at gunpoint kind
of like a typical equivalent

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:90%
of a SWAT team arrested him.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And they always do those
things to try to embarrass you.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So they came at midnight
in front of his kids

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:90%
in pajamas dragging him away.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was a very
prominent Washington politician

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.860 align:middle line:84%
high up in the
Justice Department,

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean really high up in
the Justice Department,

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
who the next day called
the local sheriff and said,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
you let Kelly out
or I'm going to have

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:84%
the entire federal government
investigate every one of you.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.007 align:middle line:84%
You'll be audited on your income
tax for the last 25 years.

00:19:36.007 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you don't
want to mess with me.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.850 align:middle line:84%
He was let out of jail within
five minutes of that phone

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:40.770 align:middle line:90%
call.

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And they never went
after him again.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:90%
He continued to practice.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:84%
He just had patients
sign a form saying,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a medical doctor,
I'm doing nutritional,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
and they let them alone.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:90%
So all these incredible stories.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And I would interview patients
who would confirm all this

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:90%
and his family.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.215 align:middle line:90%
I knew three of his four kids.

00:19:58.215 --> 00:19:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
have an easy time

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:84%
because they were the kids of
this crazy cancer quack doctor.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.685 align:middle line:84%
And "Dallas Morning
News" newspaper

00:20:04.685 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:84%
would carried it and
the local radio-- again,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:90%
this is pre-internet.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was tough.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
They would go to school
and be laughed at,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:90%
the crazy quack doctor.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:90%
So it was tough for them.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea why the Iranian
crisis really started.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.410 align:middle line:84%
What an interesting nugget of
information from Dr. Gonzalez.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen up as he
continues to explain

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.910 align:middle line:84%
why pancreatic enzymes are so
effective in treating cancer.

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.630 align:middle line:84%
What it, Dr. Gonzalez,
in the pancreatic enzymes

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:84%
that is so successful
at reversing the cancer?

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> No one's ever had the
financing to do the work.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.969 align:middle line:84%
Now, Beard did animal
studies 100 years ago.

00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:90%
We've done animal studies, too.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%
We were fortunate
that we've had funding

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.650 align:middle line:84%
from two major
international corporations.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
People laugh when I say it,
but Proctor & Gamble gave us

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:84%
millions of dollars to
help perfect the enzyme

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:90%
and Nestle's.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.105 align:middle line:84%
The chief of research
at Nestle, Pierre Guesry

00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:84%
was the former medical director
of the Pasteur Institute.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Nestle lured him away to
run their research division.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Nestle in those days had a $600
million basic science research

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.735 align:middle line:90%
division.

00:21:04.735 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:84%
They have a campus in
Switzerland off of Lake Geneva

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:90%
that rivals the NIH.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I have lectured
there several times.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And Guesry is a real scientist.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.034 align:middle line:84%
He's a physician
by training and was

00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:84%
head of the Pasteur
Institute, one

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
the most pre-eminent research
institutions in the world.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:21.427 align:middle line:84%
And he had heard about
my work back in 1992.

00:21:21.427 --> 00:21:22.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this is pre-internet.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
people heard about me.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I do know so I'm
actually kind of exaggerating.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Pierre was lives in Malta now.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:84%
He's retired and has
a sailboat and sails

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:90%
around the Mediterranean.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:84%
He set up a research
group to travel

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:84%
the world looking for
alternative therapies that

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:90%
might be useful.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.246 align:middle line:90%
These are genius people.

00:21:42.246 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
They don't tend
their prejudices.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:44.994 align:middle line:84%
They just want to
say, they don't

00:21:44.994 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
care if it's moondust or spooky
stuff or radioactive waves.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.180 align:middle line:84%
They don't care as
long as it works.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:84%
So they actually set up
a division very quietly,

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.030 align:middle line:90%
highly funded.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And they sent a team around the
world from the jungles of New

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:90%
Guinea to New York to me.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>> A division within Nestle?

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Within Nestle to look
into alternative therapies.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.644 align:middle line:84%
Unknown, it never
was publicized.

00:22:08.644 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And they traveled the world.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I
got a phone call--

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going off on a
tangent about enzymes

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:90%
but you can edit this down.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.792 align:middle line:90%
This is great stuff.

00:22:16.792 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I got a call from the
research director at Nestle.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.333 align:middle line:84%
I said, what the heck does a
research director at Nestle

00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:22.190 align:middle line:90%
want to do with me?

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:26.695 align:middle line:84%
And he told me his name, Pierre
Guesry I said, rings a bell.

00:22:26.695 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And this was before
the internet,

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:90%
so you couldn't Google it.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.800 align:middle line:90%
But I found a way.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, the guy who ran
the Pasteur Institute.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:90%
And so I called him back.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want to come
to New York and meet with you.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:90%
You want to meet with me?

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat chocolate.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.640 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:90%
He laughed.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to do with chocolate.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.912 align:middle line:84%
He explained that
they had been looking

00:22:43.912 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
into alternative therapies
and my name kept coming up

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:46.905 align:middle line:90%
and he wanted to meet with me.

00:22:46.905 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So he met with me
and the end result

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
is Nestle agreed
to fund studies.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.340 align:middle line:84%
They funded our first
clinical study and it was very

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.173 align:middle line:84%
successful with peancratic
cancer in humans,

00:22:53.173 --> 00:22:56.440 align:middle line:84%
but also animal
studies back in 2002,

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:84%
2004 that were done at
the University of Nebraska

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.290 align:middle line:84%
by Parviz Pour, P-O-U-R,
who's one of the preeminent

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
researchers in the molecular
biology of pancreatic cancer.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Pour developed an animal
model for pancreatic cancer

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:90%
that they used in our study.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And he used the most
aggressive animal model

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
at his disposal and Nestle
funded him to do this.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They were going to really
put my enzymes to the test.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.560 align:middle line:90%
And it was extremely successful.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And Pour told me that this is
the first time in his lifetime

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.950 align:middle line:84%
that he saw this particular
model respond to anything.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.449 align:middle line:10%
It didn't respond
to chemo, anything.

00:23:26.449 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:10%
So he was very impressed.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.531 align:middle line:10%
Published in a peer-reviewed
journal, "Pancreas,"

00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:30.700 align:middle line:10%
I think it was in 2004.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:90%
We have copies around.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So we know from
animal models they

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.744 align:middle line:84%
work, from my first clinical
study that it works.

00:23:36.744 --> 00:23:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know the
molecular biology,

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.130 align:middle line:90%
to answer your question.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.171 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how it
actually kills cancer cells.

00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:42.845 align:middle line:84%
What we think is the
proteolytic, which

00:23:42.845 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:84%
are the protein digesting
pancreatic enzymes like tripsin

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and chymotripsin, actually
tear apart the cell membrane.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Cell membranes are lipid,
fatty, but they also

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:84%
have protein molecules that
are receptors and pores that

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:84%
allow nutrients to get in and
waste products to get out.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.750 align:middle line:84%
That's how cells survive,
with those protein

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:59.624 align:middle line:90%
pores in the memory.

00:23:59.624 --> 00:24:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And these are proteins
like any other protein.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.956 align:middle line:84%
We think the enzymes
chew them up.

00:24:02.956 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, they don't
affect normal tissue.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And Beard said in his book
more than 100 years ago

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that there's a reason
that cancer cells have

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:84%
the opposite electrical
charge than normal cells.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Everyone laughed at him at that
time, we now know that's true.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And normal cells repulse
the pancreatic enzymes

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.459 align:middle line:84%
in the bloodstream, but
cancer cells attract them.

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And the enzymes go
right to the cancer cell

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.625 align:middle line:84%
and we believe chew up the
proteins on the cell membrane,

00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:90%
the cell does.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.738 align:middle line:90%
So we think it's that simple.

00:24:27.738 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:84%
We haven't had the trillions
of dollars of funding

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:90%
to substantiate that.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Pour wanted to do that.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Nestle was willing to fund
more, but the key with Nestle

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is I would have had to turn
over my intellectual property.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.420 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
a co-ownership.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.902 align:middle line:84%
They wanted they had their
patent lawyers in the US filing

00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:84%
patents, but it would have been
Nestle and me as co-owners.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.575 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that is
Pierre retires and then

00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:84%
the next person may
think that's all quackery

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and then Nestle owns my work
and I can't do anything with it.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So I said, no thank
you, gracious.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:01.157 align:middle line:84%
We're still friends, Pierre
and I. And he understood why.

00:25:01.157 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Mr. Griffin, tell us a
little bit about the role that

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:84%
pancreatic enzymes might play
in prevention and/or treatment

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:90%
of cancer.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Very important.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for asking that.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:10%
A moment ago, I said
there were two factors,

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:10%
the extrinsic factor and
the intrinsic factor.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:10%
And we've been talking
about the extrinsic factors

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.136 align:middle line:10%
so far, the food that
comes in from outside.

00:25:21.136 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But there are
certain things that

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:26.290 align:middle line:84%
are generated within the body
that are very, very important.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of those happens to be
the pancreatic enzymes, tripsyn

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and chimotripsyn
and other digestive

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:84%
enzymes that have a special
mission of digesting

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:90%
meat protein.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating story.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:84%
They had known for a
long time that the--

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
let me back up a
little bit by saying

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
one of the questions
that puzzled

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:84%
scientists for a long time is,
why doesn't the immune system

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:90%
attack cancer cells?

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're working
on the assumption

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:84%
that cancer is something
that's foreign to the body--

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:84%
which is not our
assumption, of course;

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.820 align:middle line:84%
our assumption is that cancer
is natural for the body that's

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.810 align:middle line:90%
going awry.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.170 align:middle line:84%
But the orthodox view
if cancer is something

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.070 align:middle line:84%
foreign to the body, it's
not supposed to be there,

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.850 align:middle line:84%
why doesn't the immune system
attack it and destroy it?

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is that cancer
cells have a protein coating

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.270 align:middle line:90%
around them, a protein coding.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And that has a negative
electrostatic charge.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.700 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing the more I learn
about how much electricity

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.729 align:middle line:90%
plays a role inside the body.

00:26:38.729 --> 00:26:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I used to think it
was all chemistry.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, chemistry is
basically electricity.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.714 align:middle line:84%
The little valences, you
see the pluses and minuses

00:26:45.714 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:90%
on that charts and so forth.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It's all electricity or
the chemistry doesn't work.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this protein
coding around the cancer cells,

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:56.440 align:middle line:84%
one of its unique qualities
has a negative electrostatic

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.830 align:middle line:90%
charge.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.575 align:middle line:90%
Well, the immune cells--

00:26:59.575 --> 00:27:02.530 align:middle line:84%
the lymphocytes, the
leukocytes, the monocytes,

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:84%
all these white
blood cells that are

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.780 align:middle line:84%
supposed to attack
the foreign invaders--

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.650 align:middle line:84%
they have a negative
electrostatic charge also.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, everyone knows that common
polarities repel each other.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So the cancer cell
is well protected

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:90%
against the white blood cell.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the reason is
because the cancer cell is not

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.515 align:middle line:90%
foreign to the body.

00:27:23.515 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the
natural protections.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.180 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I'm a friend, not a foe.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Even thought I'm out of
whack, I'm still a friend.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So now, if you are
eating foods that

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.720 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of meat
protein in them,

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going
to use most, if not all,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of that digestive enzyme
produced by your pancreas

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:90%
to digest the meat.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's meant to do.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.420 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's very
little, if anything,

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:90%
left over to do anything else.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:04.080 align:middle line:84%
But if your diet is
low in meat protein

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and if your pancreas is
normal, functioning OK,

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
you should have plenty
of digestive enzymes

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:84%
to take care of
the meat and still

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.880 align:middle line:90%
be plenty in the bloodstream.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, when these
digestive enzymes

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
come to the cancer cells,
they say, ah, protein, meat.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And they will actually
digest away that coating.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Now the underlying
cancer cell is exposed

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and it has a positive
electrostatic charge.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And now here come the
white blood cells.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And they do literally to
attack the cancer cell

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:84%
once it's been stripped of
its electrical protection.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So all of the physicians
that I have ever

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
met that are following
this alternative therapy,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:84%
this concept, one of
the things they focus on

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is making sure that the
patient changes the diet

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:84%
to either eliminate
meat altogether or make

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.941 align:middle line:90%
sure it's very, very low.

00:29:00.941 --> 00:29:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't understand that.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:84%
They think, what is he, just
some kind of a vegetarian nut?

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Do we have to eat vegetables,
too, to go along with it?

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, you do.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
If you want to have the
full mechanism working

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.180 align:middle line:84%
in your favor, you
definitely-- at least

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.370 align:middle line:84%
if you have clinical
cancer, you definitely

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure that whatever
your pancreas is producing

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.350 align:middle line:84%
in the way of these digestive
enzymes is completely available

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:90%
to do that job.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And that would explain
then why many physicians,

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:84%
part of their protocol
to treat cancer,

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:84%
add pancreatic enzymes
to the protocol.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.676 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly it.

00:29:37.676 --> 00:29:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So tripsin and
chymotripsin, they

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:90%
tear apart the cell membrane.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.000 align:middle line:84%
They digest the protein
coating around the cancer cell,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:84%
making it visible to
your immune system.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.665 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating info.

00:29:47.665 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear from
G. Edward Griffin

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
as he explains about
a substance that

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.800 align:middle line:84%
is selectively toxic
to cancer cells

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't harm
any normal cells.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a
substance in nature--

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.530 align:middle line:84%
again, can't be
patented, it's in nature.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:05.000 align:middle line:84%
It's in about 1,400
edible plants.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It's ubiquitous, it's
everywhere except on the plates

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.590 align:middle line:84%
of modern man because it
has a bitter taste to it.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a choice,
if you're not just

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:84%
living in a primitive
society and you

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
can choose what foods
you want, you normally

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.900 align:middle line:90%
don't choose bitter.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>> We like sweet.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>> We like sweet.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.350 align:middle line:10%
And that is the beginning
of the problem, or at least

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:31.790 align:middle line:10%
the answer to the question,
why does modern man have cancer

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.220 align:middle line:10%
and primitive man does not?

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.020 align:middle line:90%
There's a part of the answer.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, this substance
is called amygdalin.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.045 align:middle line:90%
It's well-known.

00:30:40.045 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:84%
It's been in the pharmacopeia
for almost 100 years.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it was first isolated
and described in Germany.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's been used for medicinal
purposes for a long, long time.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Amygdalin is a substance
that is bitter.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's found in grasses
and in seeds primarily.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And they have found
that in those cultures,

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.900 align:middle line:84%
those places in the world
where the native diet is

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:84%
rich in amygdalin
foods, the cancer rate

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:90%
is very low, if not zero.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And you compare that
diet to the diet

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.950 align:middle line:84%
of the people in
modern societies

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:84%
where cancer rates
are high and you'll

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.630 align:middle line:84%
find there's practically
no amygdalin at all.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:31.160 align:middle line:84%
It's just a complete
an eye-opener.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.725 align:middle line:90%
And what are those cultures?

00:31:32.725 --> 00:31:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Hunzas I think
you mentioned a moment ago

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:39.320 align:middle line:84%
are probably the best
known little kingdom up

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.480 align:middle line:90%
in northwest Pakistan.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very idyllic
place, I'm told.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:84%
The story a
Shangri-La, they say,

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
was actually written based
upon Hunza as the model.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.609 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knows a
story of Shangri-La.

00:31:54.609 --> 00:31:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, Hunza is pretty
much like that.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.870 align:middle line:84%
It's very remote, you risk
your life getting into it.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And I always thought I wanted
to go visit Hunza after I read

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.490 align:middle line:84%
about it until I
saw some photographs

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.650 align:middle line:84%
of these deep ravines that
you have to walk across

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.410 align:middle line:84%
on a rope bridge and it's about
a mile and a half straight

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:11.210 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:84%
You go along the
cliffs like this.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.030 align:middle line:84%
No, I think I'll
just read about it.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.990 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that is
really the way it was.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I guess they have a road in now.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The people in Hunza
never had cancer.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But afterwards, when
they come out of Hunza,

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and they go into other
countries and they

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:84%
start eating the same foods
that those people eat,

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.510 align:middle line:84%
they come down with
cancer like everyone else.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.420 align:middle line:84%
In Hunza, at least
in the beginning

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.190 align:middle line:84%
when all this research
was done, there

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:90%
was no such thing as money.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
primitive society

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and a man's wealth was measured
by the number of apricot trees

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.580 align:middle line:90%
he owns.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And people eat
apricots seeds there,

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:84%
a little sweeter than the ones
in California, but still loaded

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:54.420 align:middle line:90%
with amygdalin.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.970 align:middle line:90%
And they eat them like candy.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:90%
It was like a delicacy there.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:90%
So they're just one example.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:84%
There are other cultures,
the Vilcabamba, the Navajo

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and the Hopi Indians,
the aboriginal Eskimos.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
All of those cultures had
zero or very low cancer rates.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
native diet, in every case

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:84%
their foods are at least
200 times, if not more,

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.740 align:middle line:84%
rich in amygdalin
than anything that you

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:84%
would find in a
major city or even

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:33.580 align:middle line:84%
in the countryside
in our Western world.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:90%
So that's a clue.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And so then the next
question is, well,

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.670 align:middle line:84%
what is this thing, amygdalin,
and how does it work?

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.100 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Amygdalin is a molecule
that has four components

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:90%
in it locked together.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
There are two components
of sugar or glucose,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.660 align:middle line:84%
there's one component
of cyanide--

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's the word
that scares people,

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and we'll come back
to that in a minute--

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.550 align:middle line:84%
and one component
of benzaldehyde.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, people say, wow, cyanide.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:84%
You want to take cyanide
and treat cancer?

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And the answer is, yes.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, doesn't cyanide kill you?

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes if it's real
pure gaseous cyanide.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.800 align:middle line:90%
If it's pure cyanide, yes.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.659 align:middle line:84%
But when it's in a molecule
with other components,

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:26.239 align:middle line:84%
it's not cyanide;
it's something else.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like vitamin B-12,
it's called cyanocobalamin.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.699 align:middle line:84%
We would be dead if we didn't
have cyanide in our bodies

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:38.440 align:middle line:90%
in that form.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.820 align:middle line:84%
In cyanocobalamin it's not
cyanide, it's cyanocobalamin.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.189 align:middle line:84%
It's a molecule that's made
up of one or the components

00:34:46.189 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:90%
being cyanide.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a big difference
between free cyanide,

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.420 align:middle line:84%
which is gaseous, or when it's
locked with other components

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:90%
or elements.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
key to understanding

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.700 align:middle line:84%
why we're not worried
about cyanide being

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:90%
part of the molecule.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:84%
The real question
is, well, what is it

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:90%
that would release the cyanide?

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
benzaldehyde is toxic, too.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Most people don't know that.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And the two together are even
more toxic than two times each.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you released a
cyanide and a benzaldehyde,

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:84%
you've released a
very toxic component.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be very
careful about that.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the next question
is, well, what releases it?

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you're
sitting down for this.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I think
you already know this.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:10%
But I hope everybody
watching this is sitting down

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.030 align:middle line:10%
because the thing that
releases the cyanide

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:39.860 align:middle line:10%
and the benzaldehyde is an
enzyme called beta-glucosidase.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Beta-glucosidase.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.730 align:middle line:90%
It's an enzyme.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.500 align:middle line:90%
And where is that found?

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.450 align:middle line:84%
In cancer cells, and
only in cancer cells.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a beautiful mechanism of
nature that could not have been

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.550 align:middle line:90%
accidental.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:36:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's natural method
of controlling overgrowth,

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:00.850 align:middle line:90%
over-healing.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Because once you get one cell
that is an over-healing cell,

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.810 align:middle line:84%
it contains this unlocking
enzyme, as we call it.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And the unlocking enzyme comes
in contact with amygdalin

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:18.115 align:middle line:84%
if you are eating food
with amygdalin in it--

00:36:18.115 --> 00:36:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the big if.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the big if.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:84%
If you're not eating food
with amygdalin in it,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:90%
then it doesn't work.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.776 align:middle line:84%
But if you are
eating-- it doesn't

00:36:24.776 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:90%
take much, just a little bit.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you are eating it and
it's in your bloodstream,

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.570 align:middle line:84%
it comes in contact with
that overgrowth cell.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
The overgrowth cell releases
the toxic components

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:90%
and commits Hari Kari.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even know
that anything happened.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.080 align:middle line:84%
You come to the
conclusion that everybody

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.220 align:middle line:84%
has cancer all the time,
but it's continually

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.640 align:middle line:84%
being controlled and eliminated
by a natural mechanism

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.440 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing to worry about.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.944 align:middle line:84%
It's part of nature, it's
part of the healing process.

00:36:57.944 --> 00:36:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The only time you
need to worry about it

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:84%
is that you've messed up
your body in some way,

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.742 align:middle line:84%
then you're not
giving it the fuel.

00:37:03.742 --> 00:37:05.200 align:middle line:84%
You haven't given
it the components

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.070 align:middle line:90%
it needs to do its job.

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the big difference
between the alternative view

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.020 align:middle line:84%
of cancer and the
orthodox view of cancer.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk about the
California report of 1953.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I've read some of your writings
about the California report

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very
interesting topic.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's a clear
example of the degree

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:33.960 align:middle line:84%
to which I guess there's
no other word but fraud,

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:90%
the degree to which fraud--

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.130 align:middle line:84%
deliberate,
conscious fraud-- can

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.920 align:middle line:84%
be injected into what
we would normally

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:90%
think is a scientific process.

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Early in the days of the
development of Laetrile,

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.850 align:middle line:84%
there were stories circulating
that people were getting well.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They're being
treated and they're

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.020 align:middle line:84%
coming back from the edge
of the grave and so forth.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And so naturally, the
pharmaceutical industry

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.750 align:middle line:90%
wanted to put an end to this.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And so they set up a deal where
they wanted to have it tested.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:84%
The idea is, OK, none
of this discussion

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
about people getting saved,
none of these little stories.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.089 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a scientific test.

00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, everybody was
in favor of that.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Except they insisted
that only those who

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.070 align:middle line:84%
were opponents of Laetrile do
the tests and nobody else could

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:90%
do the tests, you see.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.560 align:middle line:84%
It had to be the
oncologists and the people

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:84%
on the staff of the
pharmaceutical industry

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.455 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, way to
make a long story short,

00:38:31.455 --> 00:38:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and it is a long story, the
California branch of the AMA,

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.940 align:middle line:84%
the California
Medical Association,

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.900 align:middle line:84%
was given the task of
doing a test on Laetrile.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
were in charge of this

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.490 align:middle line:90%
were all in the cancer industry.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The two men, if I remember
of the names correctly,

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that wrote the analysis
of the report were Drs.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.230 align:middle line:90%
McFarland and Garland, I think.

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And McFarland I think
was a surgeon and Garland

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I think was a
radiologist, or maybe

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.806 align:middle line:90%
it was the other way around.

00:39:09.806 --> 00:39:13.224 align:middle line:84%
But it was a surgeon
and a radiologist.

00:39:13.224 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And the other
members of the panel

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.230 align:middle line:90%
were all in similar positions.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Most of them were radiologists,
interestingly enough, I think.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they all had
kind of a vested interest

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.980 align:middle line:84%
in not finding something
that would interfere

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.810 align:middle line:90%
with their businesses, you see.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So there was sort
of a bias built in.

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, they did this
very fine scientific study

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.910 align:middle line:90%
using mice and so forth.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:90%
They spent a lot of money.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And they produced the report
and McFarland and Garland

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:84%
announced that there was
no evidence whatsoever

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:50.750 align:middle line:84%
that Laetrile had
any effect whatsoever

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.900 align:middle line:90%
in the control of cancer.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So that was all
anybody needed to hear.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:00.170 align:middle line:84%
There was something done by the
California Medical Association

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and two fine, upstanding
doctors-- well,

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:84%
these doctors, just
to give you an idea

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:12.860 align:middle line:84%
of how fine and scientifically
astute they were,

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.810 align:middle line:84%
these are the guys
that both of them

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.540 align:middle line:84%
said that there was
no connection at all

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:21.250 align:middle line:84%
between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Same doctors?

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Same doctors, yes, before
they got involved in this

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:90%
report.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.900 align:middle line:84%
They had already
been bought and paid

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.155 align:middle line:84%
for by the tobacco
industry, of course.

00:40:30.155 --> 00:40:32.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think
it was McFarland

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that even made this
fantastic quote, a pack a day

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.570 align:middle line:90%
keeps cancer away.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.619 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen the newspaper ads
that they used to run that had

00:40:42.619 --> 00:40:43.419 align:middle line:90%
that exact quote.

00:40:43.419 --> 00:40:43.775 align:middle line:90%
That was from him.

00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:44.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:46.040 align:middle line:90%
That was from him.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.290 align:middle line:10%
Incidentally, he died
in bed some years

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:53.140 align:middle line:10%
later in a fire started
by his cigarette.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It burned him up.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sorry that anybody
died, especially from fire,

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.180 align:middle line:84%
but I thought there was
a certain irony there.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Poetic justice.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Poetic justice or something.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And the other guy died
of cancer of the lung.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:90%
They were both heavy smokers.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that gives
you a little idea

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.510 align:middle line:84%
of the scientific
expertise of these guys.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, as far as most
doctors are concerned,

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:23.300 align:middle line:84%
if they see a report from the
California Medical Association

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:28.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's accepted by the
teaching institutions,

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:32.210 align:middle line:84%
there's no question that that
is science, that's authentic.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>> That's gospel truth.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That is gospel truth.

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and it was accepted as
gospel truth for quite a while.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we got hold of a
copy of the full report.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten how
he did it, but did.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big, thick report
and all anybody had ever read

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:56.530 align:middle line:84%
was that cover page were
McDonald and Farland--

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.780 align:middle line:84%
McFarland and Garland,
I'll get it straight.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like a comedy
routine, doesn't it?

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's on first?

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's on first?

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, all anybody ever
saw was that little summary

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.370 align:middle line:90%
that they wrote.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that these guys
never used Laetrile themselves.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.860 align:middle line:84%
They were just sort of
analyzing the laboratory

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.590 align:middle line:84%
results of the study and
this is their summary.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we go back and read
the actual pages of the report,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:26.360 align:middle line:84%
the summary was a
lie, an absolute lie.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of like the "Cliff
Notes" being correct.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Cliff Notes"
are incorrect, yes.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever went
back to look at--

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.140 align:middle line:84%
there was plenty of evidence
in the laboratory work

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that it did retard
the growth of cancer,

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.550 align:middle line:84%
in spite of the
fact that there was

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.745 align:middle line:84%
a high question about the
quality of the Laetrile

00:42:42.745 --> 00:42:43.545 align:middle line:90%
they were using.

00:42:43.545 --> 00:42:46.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was pretty
obvious that they did not

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.230 align:middle line:90%
have good quality Laetrile.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It was also obvious they
were using lower dosages

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:84%
than was being used
in the clinics.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And in spite of
those two handicaps,

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.750 align:middle line:84%
the laboratory results were
reported case after case

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:84%
after case where these mice were
recovering from cancer right

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.010 align:middle line:90%
in the body of the report.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet, in the summary, there
was absolutely no evidence

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.650 align:middle line:90%
of this, et cetera, et cetera.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.530 align:middle line:84%
This was sort of the
flagship of what had been

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:14.470 align:middle line:90%
repeated many times since then.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The Sloan-Kettering report is
pretty much the same thing.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's on and on and on.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And once people realized
that not only is there

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.720 align:middle line:84%
just ineptitude or bias in
the cancer industry, bias

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.540 align:middle line:90%
against natural therapies.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.400 align:middle line:90%
But also deliberate fraud.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.941 align:middle line:84%
Now we're dealing with
a different animal.

00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
consider the number

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.580 align:middle line:84%
of people who die from cancer,
this amounts to genocide.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Unbelievable information
from G. Edward Griffin

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.140 align:middle line:84%
about the suppression of
Laetrile back in the 1950s

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and how this information could
have saved people's lives.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.330 align:middle line:90%
He equates this to genocide.

00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Sounds like something that would
have happened in Soviet Russia,

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.170 align:middle line:90%
but not in the good old USA.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:03.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So I would call this the
Sovietization of the United

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.530 align:middle line:10%
States.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:10%
It's up to the central
Soviet to approve the doctor

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.310 align:middle line:10%
to treat the patient.

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:10%
And it up to local Soviet,
which is like to do the rest.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.840 align:middle line:10%
So they borrowed the
idea from Comrade Stalin

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.810 align:middle line:10%
how to really restrict
freedom of the people.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:24.050 align:middle line:10%
And that's what they do
without any punishment.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.450 align:middle line:10%
Some brave doctors
are writing about it,

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.380 align:middle line:10%
but this is one committee
after another committee.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:30.832 align:middle line:10%
And you can't go
against committee

00:44:30.832 --> 00:44:32.290 align:middle line:10%
because in the
committee, they say,

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.400 align:middle line:10%
well, this is the
committee which really

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.720 align:middle line:10%
decided what you should do.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.740 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.240 align:middle line:10%
So like in the
Communist country,

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.573 align:middle line:10%
there is a committee who is
telling the engineers, well,

00:44:40.573 --> 00:44:42.490 align:middle line:10%
if you don't like the
design of your bridge,

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.800 align:middle line:10%
do it a different way
because it does not conform

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.609 align:middle line:10%
to Marxist-Leninist principles.

00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Even though they might
not have known anything about

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.440 align:middle line:10%
a bridge.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:49.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:50.540 align:middle line:10%
>> They would be determining--

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.990 align:middle line:10%
>> --doesn't conform to
Marxist-Leninist principles,

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.810 align:middle line:10%
period.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:10%
That's what it is.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the deal with
Texas Medical Board,

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:84%
it does not conform
to our policy.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:00.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:01.350 align:middle line:10%
So forget it.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.192 align:middle line:10%
Patients may die and
you should not use it.

00:45:04.192 --> 00:45:05.650 align:middle line:10%
>> And I'm sure
patients have died.

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:06.865 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, many of them have died

00:45:06.865 --> 00:45:08.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Because of the
inability to access--

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:11.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Many of them died, many
of them have deteriorated

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.884 align:middle line:10%
because it took months to
really approve a single patient.

00:45:14.884 --> 00:45:17.050 align:middle line:10%
So this country obviously
has the finest regulations

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:17.890 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.705 align:middle line:10%
In the other countries,
it takes simply

00:45:20.705 --> 00:45:23.860 align:middle line:10%
a telephone call of the
doctor to a central agency

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.572 align:middle line:10%
and notifying them, OK, look,
I have such and such patient.

00:45:26.572 --> 00:45:28.530 align:middle line:10%
I would like to treat
them with antineoplatons.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Can I do it?

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.470 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.790 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:31.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:32.370 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.337 align:middle line:10%
So that's what is
done, say in Japan,

00:45:34.337 --> 00:45:35.920 align:middle line:10%
in Australia, in
some other countries,

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.710 align:middle line:10%
and in European Union countries.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.010 align:middle line:10%
They don't need even need
to ask the government

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:46.320 align:middle line:10%
if this is a patient that does
not have any other ways to us

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.120 align:middle line:10%
it.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.280 align:middle line:10%
They can use it.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:51.700 align:middle line:10%
In the United States, you
need to file tons of papers,

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:10%
go through various
committees, ask the guys

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.050 align:middle line:10%
in Washington for permission.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:46:00.340 align:middle line:10%
And then recently, we've we some
cases where permission came,

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:03.490 align:middle line:10%
but the next day the child
died because it was too late.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:05.300 align:middle line:10%
Because brain tumors,
they don't wait.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.250 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:07.440 align:middle line:10%
>> They don't wait
for the clerks.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.240 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:13.380 align:middle line:10%
They may, some of them, multiply
five times in one month.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.620 align:middle line:10%
So they are extremely deadly.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.410 align:middle line:10%
Which obviously is
part of medical science

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:21.570 align:middle line:10%
which is away from the knowledge
of the clerks in Washington.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.830 align:middle line:10%
You see, the times are
changing very rapidly.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.560 align:middle line:10%
This is just two
weeks ago, there

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.280 align:middle line:10%
was a second war with the
FDA which was finished.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.770 align:middle line:10%
They were trying to get rid
of us for a couple of years.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.230 align:middle line:10%
Initially, it started with
a smear campaign, which

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.080 align:middle line:10%
is typical for Soviet Russia.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.110 align:middle line:10%
They typically use KGB to
start with some little reporter

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:45.220 align:middle line:10%
with some unknown newspaper
to begin a smear campaign

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.530 align:middle line:10%
and spread it to the largest
newspaper in the country.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:49.960 align:middle line:10%
And that's what's happened.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.100 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what they're
doing here now?

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's spread to
"USA Today," whatever.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:58.010 align:middle line:10%
They hired a bunch of bloggers
to continuously smear us

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.050 align:middle line:10%
everywhere.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:46:59.990 align:middle line:10%
It's nothing unusual.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.620 align:middle line:10%
It was practiced by communists,
it was practiced by Nazis.

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:06.580 align:middle line:10%
That's normally what is done
by big totalitarian agencies.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming from a man who left
communist Poland to immigrate

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.590 align:middle line:84%
to the United States,
those statements from Dr.

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Brzezinski are quite telling.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.119 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear a little bit
about the history of one

00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:18.610 align:middle line:84%
of the most well-known clinics
in Mexico, the Oasis of Hope,

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:21.490 align:middle line:84%
by the founder's son,
Dr. Francisco Contreras.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>> In the '60s, my father
was the director of one

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.850 align:middle line:84%
of the biggest oncology
centers in Mexico City.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:29.920 align:middle line:90%
He was an army doctor.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And he went on a
tour or on vacation

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and visited one of the hospitals
of the time of Hippocrates,

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:90%
around 300 years before Christ.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.770 align:middle line:90%
They gave him a tour.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:46.090 align:middle line:10%
And the tour guide told them,
this hospital at that time

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:47.500 align:middle line:10%
was divided into three areas.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And the patients would
come to the first area

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and be evaluated physically,
the second area they would

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.380 align:middle line:84%
be evaluated emotionally,
and the third area it was

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.840 align:middle line:90%
more or less a spiritual thing.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.630 align:middle line:84%
There was a tunnel, and they
would go through the tunnel

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and somebody outside
would be telling

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:84%
the guy that was going
through the tunnel,

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.570 align:middle line:84%
unbeknownst to them, you'll
be healed, you'll be healed.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And they thought
that it was the gods.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And after that experience,
my father said, well,

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.890 align:middle line:84%
the reason why we're
failing in oncology

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.270 align:middle line:84%
so much is that we've become
mechanics of the human body

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're not paying attention
to the emotional and spiritual

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.350 align:middle line:90%
needs of our patients.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
back and change that.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.810 align:middle line:84%
He went back, told the staff
what they were going to do.

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The next day, they
kicked him out.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And that was the genesis
of the Oasis of Hope.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:41.170 align:middle line:84%
My father said, if the
system doesn't want to do it,

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do it.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And so he began his work
caring for the patients not

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.710 align:middle line:84%
only physically, but
emotionally and spiritually.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:55.690 align:middle line:84%
He began singing with them,
giving them Bible studies,

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:57.430 align:middle line:90%
laughter therapy.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And about three or four years
later, a lady from San Diego

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.140 align:middle line:84%
went to Canada to do
a study with Laetrile,

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.320 align:middle line:90%
a clinical trial with Laetrile.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.835 align:middle line:90%
She came back to San Diego.

00:49:08.835 --> 00:49:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And my father at that time
was the only pathologist

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.190 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico and in San Diego.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:15.930 align:middle line:84%
So all of the oncologists
in San Diego knew him.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And when she came
back and she wanted

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:20.440 align:middle line:84%
to continue with
Laetrile, nobody

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.910 align:middle line:90%
wanted to give it to her.

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So they one oncologists
say, well, I

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.360 align:middle line:90%
know an oncologist in Mexico.

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.812 align:middle line:90%
They're less stringent there.

00:49:27.812 --> 00:49:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you go and see him.

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.529 align:middle line:84%
She came to my dad and
told him her problem.

00:49:32.529 --> 00:49:34.820 align:middle line:84%
My father said, well, I don't
know anything about this.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.610 align:middle line:84%
But she was just
riddled with cancer.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:39.120 align:middle line:90%
He says, I see no problem.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.019 align:middle line:90%
I'll give it to you.

00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:41.310 align:middle line:90%
So he started giving it to her.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Six months later,
she's still alive.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.750 align:middle line:90%
A year later, no tumor activity.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And so my father said, well,
there's something to this.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And this lady knew
everybody that

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.570 align:middle line:84%
was going to Canada for the
trial, brought everybody

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:55.860 align:middle line:90%
to my dad.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And just a few years
later, the Oasis of Hope,

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.690 align:middle line:84%
there was a holistic
approach to cancer now also

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:05.740 align:middle line:90%
had alternative therapies.

00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And so our aim has always been
to integrate whatever therapies

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.160 align:middle line:84%
are available to us
from the conventional

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and from the
alternative that we can

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:20.560 align:middle line:84%
use to improve the quality
of life for our patients.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And we have been
very successful.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.570 align:middle line:84%
You can check our statistics on
our website, oasisofhope.com.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And our five-year survival
rates in the most common tumors

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:35.220 align:middle line:84%
are between two and
five times better

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:37.970 align:middle line:84%
than the national average in
the United States of America.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Laetrile has been our golden
therapy for the last 50 years.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:49.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a very innocuous
anti-tumor agent that

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.515 align:middle line:90%
works for most common cancers.

00:50:52.515 --> 00:50:56.100 align:middle line:10%
Then for patients that do
not respond well to Laetrile,

00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:01.020 align:middle line:10%
we have high dose vitamin C
given in a very special way

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.210 align:middle line:10%
that actually converts
the vitamin C virtually

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:06.270 align:middle line:10%
into chemotherapy without
any of the side effects.

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We have hyperthermia available,
we have all kinds of vaccines.

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Another major part
of the therapy

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:14.750 align:middle line:84%
is signaling
transduction with foods

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.600 align:middle line:84%
to block the production
of enzymes and proteins

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that are absolutely necessary
for the tumors to grow.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.220 align:middle line:84%
The combination
of all of this is

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.490 align:middle line:84%
what we call the Contreras
metabolic therapy

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:31.960 align:middle line:90%
or integritive therapy.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:39.350 align:middle line:84%
We also use a number of
immune stimulation agents,

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:44.850 align:middle line:84%
not only the laughter therapy
and the emotional uplifting

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.430 align:middle line:84%
music, all of the things
that we mentioned before.

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But we have a product
from Japan that

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.440 align:middle line:84%
has proved to be very
effective and there's

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.130 align:middle line:90%
at least 70 publications, AHCC.

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.190 align:middle line:84%
It has proven to
improve significantly

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the quality and quantity
of the immune system.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So our therapeutic
approach really

00:52:04.350 --> 00:52:08.940 align:middle line:84%
has about 25 different
things that we'll

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.400 align:middle line:84%
integrate depending
on the patient's needs

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.080 align:middle line:90%
and on the patient's status.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I honestly don't know another
medical doctor that uses this

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:19.390 align:middle line:84%
many different approaches
all in under one roof.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:23.700 align:middle line:10%
There's probably no other
clinic in North America that

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:28.110 align:middle line:10%
houses the staff
and the equipment

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:30.810 align:middle line:10%
and the array of
treatments that we have.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not just
interested in what's

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.640 align:middle line:90%
available in the United States.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.520 align:middle line:84%
We reach outside of
the United States

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and the world to find
all the treatments.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Like GcMAF is not even
made in the United States

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:48.894 align:middle line:84%
so we get our GcMAF
from another country.

00:52:48.894 --> 00:52:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you mean,
what does that stand for?

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>> GcMAF is a macrophage
activating factor.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Macrophages are the Pac
Men of your immune system.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have an
illness, and I'm not just

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:04.590 align:middle line:84%
talking about cancer but
many chronic illnesses,

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.840 align:middle line:84%
we make an enzyme
called nagalase.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And nagalase poisons
the macrophages,

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.480 align:middle line:84%
inhibiting prohibiting
them doing their job.

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that macrophage
activating factor

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:20.430 align:middle line:84%
is a substance that you
can give internally,

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.920 align:middle line:84%
either injection
form, inhalation form,

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.430 align:middle line:84%
oral form from everything
from autism to cancer.

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And the macrophages
you call them the Pac Men.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.220 align:middle line:90%
So what do they eat?

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>> They eat the things that
your body doesn't like.

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So for example, viruses
and bacteria and fungi

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals and
toxins, everything

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that is attacking the body
that is unable to do its job

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.409 align:middle line:84%
and have a functioning
immune system.

00:53:48.409 --> 00:53:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that quote
by Dr. Connealy,

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.159 align:middle line:84%
the macrophages are the Pac
Men of the immune system.

00:53:52.159 --> 00:53:53.783 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just picture
that in your head.

00:53:53.783 --> 00:53:56.520 align:middle line:84%
You can see the Pac Men chomping
down the bad guys almost

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.440 align:middle line:90%
like a military invasion.

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of military, one of
my favorite military movies

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:05.530 align:middle line:84%
is a World War II movie, Steve
McQueen, "The Great Escape."

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:07.835 align:middle line:84%
Remember when he died
in 1980 of mesothelioma

00:54:07.835 --> 00:54:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and do you remember the
story that you heard?

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn
the rest of the story

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.790 align:middle line:90%
from Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez.

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The Steve McQueen story
has never been properly told.

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:17.070 align:middle line:90%
That's another big thing.

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:18.910 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of biographies
about Steve McQueen

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:21.129 align:middle line:90%
and mention Kelly, a guy.

00:54:21.129 --> 00:54:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to some
of these authors.

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:24.410 align:middle line:84%
They never really
investigated it properly.

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:25.368 align:middle line:90%
I know the whole story.

00:54:25.368 --> 00:54:28.200 align:middle line:10%
In fact, in this office about 25
feet from where we're sitting,

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.740 align:middle line:10%
I have Steve McQueen's complete
medical records, even when

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.790 align:middle line:10%
he used assumed names.

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:33.695 align:middle line:90%
I've got all his records here.

00:54:33.695 --> 00:54:34.800 align:middle line:90%
I got them from Kelly.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.670 align:middle line:90%
So they're in this office.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:36.628 align:middle line:90%
I know the whole story.

00:54:36.628 --> 00:54:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I know it like nobody else
has because no one has ever

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:41.060 align:middle line:90%
had his complete medical file.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:43.440 align:middle line:84%
McQueen was kind
of a reckless guy,

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.060 align:middle line:84%
a motorcycle racer,
smoker drinker,

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.010 align:middle line:84%
lived a little hard
life, as he's famous for.

00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:50.860 align:middle line:84%
He started getting
sick in 1978, 1979.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.600 align:middle line:84%
He went to his fancy
Los Angeles doctors

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.850 align:middle line:90%
and they kind of blew it off--

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:55.933 align:middle line:84%
you live too hard, you've
got to cut down smoking.

00:54:55.933 --> 00:54:57.600 align:middle line:90%
No one took him seriously.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he was so debilitated
he went to his doctors

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and says, you've
got to do something.

00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:03.556 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the genius gets the
idea. let's do a chest x-ray.

00:55:03.556 --> 00:55:04.830 align:middle line:90%
He's got tumors in both lungs.

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:05.630 align:middle line:90%
They work him up.

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:07.380 align:middle line:90%
He's got metastic mesothelioma.

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.515 align:middle line:84%
Mesothelioma is associated
with asbestos exposure.

00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was a
motorcycle fanatic.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, the
pipes in motorcycles

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:14.910 align:middle line:90%
were lined with asbestos.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And he was a great mechanic and
worked on his own motorcycles.

00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So he was exposed to a
huge amount of asbestos

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.510 align:middle line:90%
and ended up with mesothelioma.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:27.150 align:middle line:84%
In those days, 35
years ago and today,

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.750 align:middle line:84%
mesothelioma is completely
uncurable once it spreads.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:31.821 align:middle line:84%
The only hope is to get
it early and do surgery.

00:55:31.821 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, his brilliant
doctors had completely

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.486 align:middle line:84%
missed the diagnosis for
years, so by the time

00:55:35.486 --> 00:55:38.460 align:middle line:84%
he was diagnosed,
it was metastatic.

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Then the geniuses decided
to give immunotherapy.

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm trained as a classical
immunologist under Robert Good.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.870 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a study
in the history of the world

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:48.510 align:middle line:84%
showing immunotherapy has
any effect on mesothelioma.

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:90%
Talk about quackery.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:51.050 align:middle line:90%
They give it to him.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Didn't work.

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So then they decided to give
him radiation-- or maybe

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.816 align:middle line:84%
they gave him the
radiation first.

00:55:54.816 --> 00:55:56.112 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to pull up my notes.

00:55:56.112 --> 00:55:57.820 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a
study in the history

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.190 align:middle line:84%
of the world showing radiation
works on mesothelioma.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Guess what, it didn't work.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So he ends up with
stage 4 advancing cancer

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.220 align:middle line:90%
weeks from death goes to Kelly.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Kelly made one fatal mistake in
the treatment of Steve McQueen,

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.220 align:middle line:90%
he took him on as a patient.

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.770 align:middle line:84%
He was too advanced and
he was a reckless guy.

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.640 align:middle line:84%
He was still smoking,
still drinking.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:90%
But he pleaded.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And Kelly was a very
compassionate guy, said,

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:18.640 align:middle line:90%
I'll treat you.

00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.380 align:middle line:90%
But you're too weak.

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:21.520 align:middle line:84%
You can't do this at home the
way most of my patients do it.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a hospital
in Mexico at the time

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.980 align:middle line:84%
that was administering
parts of Kelly's therapy.

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.771 align:middle line:84%
He says, go down to
that hospital in Mexico

00:56:26.771 --> 00:56:28.030 align:middle line:90%
and I'll kind of direct them.

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And he did and he
wasn't 100% compliant.

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:32.790 align:middle line:84%
He still had the Haagen-Dazs
ice cream kind of smuggled

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:35.240 align:middle line:84%
in from his friends
and cigarettes.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But he did enough of it so
he started getting better.

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the doctors in
Mexico gets the brilliant idea,

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.640 align:middle line:84%
let's open him up because they
think they think the tumor--

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.540 align:middle line:84%
he had a tumor in his abdomen,
as well as in his chest--

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.660 align:middle line:84%
let's take it out, I
think it's a dead tumor.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.637 align:middle line:90%
They do the surgery.

00:56:49.637 --> 00:56:51.720 align:middle line:84%
The next day he dies of a
pulmonary embolus, which

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:52.970 align:middle line:90%
is a blood clot in the lungs.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.280 align:middle line:90%
He did not die of mesothelioma.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the tumor
was a dead tumor.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Kelly used to have it in
his office in formaldehyde,

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.240 align:middle line:84%
a dead tumor that had shrunk
down from a huge tumor

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.040 align:middle line:90%
down to nothing.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.330 align:middle line:90%
It was dead.

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:05.894 align:middle line:84%
He didn't die from-- the
way the media reports read,

00:57:05.894 --> 00:57:07.560 align:middle line:84%
which I have, it's
like Kelly took a gun

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and shot McQueen, this
crazy quack doctor.

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:12.392 align:middle line:10%
The true story has
never been told.

00:57:12.392 --> 00:57:14.100 align:middle line:10%
First, his brilliant
conventional doctors

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.500 align:middle line:10%
missed the diagnosis for a year.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Then they give
him immunotherapy,

00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.230 align:middle line:90%
which is worthless.

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Then they give him radiation,
which is worthless.

00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:23.280 align:middle line:84%
When all that
fails, then he goes

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.542 align:middle line:84%
to see Kelly, who keeps
him alive, kills the tumor,

00:57:26.542 --> 00:57:28.500 align:middle line:84%
and then gets blamed for
killing Steve McQueen.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.290 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bizarre story.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.904 align:middle line:84%
In none of the media reports
did they mention the fact

00:57:32.904 --> 00:57:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that the diagnosis
had been missed

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and the conventional doctors had
done everything they could do.

00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And even today, 2014,
metastatic mesothelioma

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.560 align:middle line:84%
is universally 100% incurable
by standard therapy.

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.562 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have patients
doing beautifully with us.

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:46.770 align:middle line:90%
So Kelly got blamed for that.

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:48.660 align:middle line:84%
He was absolutely
devastated by that.

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.330 align:middle line:84%
It really threw him off and
he never really recovered.

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:55.590 align:middle line:84%
What an amazing story that Dr.
Gonzalez just shared with us

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:56.970 align:middle line:90%
about Steve McQueen.

00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:59.700 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, I'm a
big Steve McQueen fan.

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the best war
movies I think ever

00:58:01.350 --> 00:58:02.610 align:middle line:90%
was "The Great Escape."

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and Steve McQueen
is one of my heroes.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:07.590 align:middle line:84%
He died of mesothelioma, as
Dr. Gonzalez just shared.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:09.330 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
was, as you just

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:12.930 align:middle line:84%
heard, that Dr. Kelly
actually didn't kill him.

00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:15.300 align:middle line:84%
He was known as the quack
that killed Steve McQueen.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, the
tumors were necrotic.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.630 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Kelly was actually
curing Steve McQueen

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.190 align:middle line:84%
of his mesothelioma, which is
an incurable form of cancer,

00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:26.340 align:middle line:84%
by the way, according to
traditional oncologists.

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
surgery killed him.

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting the
way that these things

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:31.830 align:middle line:84%
are spun so that the
general public now

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:35.100 align:middle line:84%
believes that Dr. Kelly,
who is now deceased,

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.800 align:middle line:84%
murdered Steve McQueen when in
reality, he was healing him.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.600 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.780 align:middle line:90%
What a powerful story.

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:41.488 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to make
it clear here, folks,

00:58:41.488 --> 00:58:44.520 align:middle line:84%
we're not telling you not to
go with traditional treatments.

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:47.530 align:middle line:84%
We are not trying to
make a decision for you.

00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Our goal is to educate.

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of the matter
is there are many options

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:52.479 align:middle line:90%
to treat cancer.

00:58:52.479 --> 00:58:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And so we want you to
know that information

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:56.910 align:middle line:84%
so that you can make an informed
decision if that diagnosis ever

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:57.630 align:middle line:90%
comes.

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:58.430 align:middle line:90%
That's our goal.

00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not to persuade you
one way or the other.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.809 align:middle line:84%
And while we're talking
about other options,

00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:04.350 align:middle line:84%
there are more
options that you still

00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:06.400 align:middle line:84%
haven't learned about, that
we have not shared with you.

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.858 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to share with
you on tomorrow night's show.

00:59:08.858 --> 00:59:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So I know you learned
tonight about a lot

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.147 align:middle line:84%
of natural treatments for
cancer and tomorrow night,

00:59:13.147 --> 00:59:15.021 align:middle line:84%
you're going to hear
about even more of them.

00:59:15.021 --> 00:59:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I know you're going to want to
join us again tomorrow night.

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:19.086 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to
seeing you then.

00:59:19.086 --> 00:59:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:59:29.410 --> 00:59:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Dana.

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:34.190 align:middle line:10%
I am 35 years old and I
began a journey with cancer

00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:37.340 align:middle line:10%
seven years ago, when I was 28.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I found out about this cancer
on Christmas Eve in 2006

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and I had emergency surgery
on Christmas morning

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to remove stage three colon
cancer that had not only

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:50.810 align:middle line:84%
attached my colon,
but had ruptured

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:52.830 align:middle line:90%
into my small intestine.

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:56.870 align:middle line:84%
We began a chemo regimen of
six months chemo treatment

00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:01.010 align:middle line:84%
through the portacath where
I would have IV treatments

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:04.610 align:middle line:84%
and I would have to go
home with a little IV bag.

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So I was attached to chemo
for three days at a time.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.730 align:middle line:84%
This went on for six months,
and at the end of the six months

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:13.730 align:middle line:84%
it was wonderful to have a
scan and hear the news that I

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:14.794 align:middle line:90%
was cancer-free.

01:00:14.794 --> 01:00:16.460 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing like
hearing that you're

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:18.940 align:middle line:84%
cancer-free after a
long cancer battle.

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:21.390 align:middle line:84%
But of course, once you
begin a cancer battle,

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:24.110 align:middle line:84%
you have to continue having
further testing to make sure

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:25.920 align:middle line:90%
that you remain healthy.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So six months after
my testing and I

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
was told I was cancer-free,
I had another scan.

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.150 align:middle line:84%
This time, the scan came back
that her cancer had returned

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and had returned
in the lymph nodes

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
between my neck and
my lower abdomen

01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and it was spread
throughout my body.

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the cancer had
returned and it was spread,

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.430 align:middle line:90%
I was told I was stage 4.

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So after two rounds
with colon cancer,

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I was told that I was
once again cancer-free.

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And we celebrated and thought
this time we'd really beat it,

01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:57.670 align:middle line:90%
this time it's done.

01:00:57.670 --> 01:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Later in that same
year, I have a PET

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:03.070 align:middle line:84%
scan just to confirm
that the cancer was gone.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:04.970 align:middle line:90%
The PET scan came back clean.

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:07.130 align:middle line:90%
There was no signs of cancer.

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Within just three weeks, I
myself noticed on my neck

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that I had some enlarged
lumps on my neck

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:17.190 align:middle line:90%
that I found very strange.

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:19.040 align:middle line:90%
So I told my doctor about it.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, let's
do a PET scan just

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:23.510 align:middle line:84%
to see what we
have going on here.

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
This time, the PET came
back very different

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.630 align:middle line:90%
than the first one.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
This time, it came
back showing that I

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
had between 10 to 15 tumors
all throughout my abdomen

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and my neck, that the cancer was
back full force, stronger than

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.950 align:middle line:90%
ever.

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And this time, I was
told that I was terminal.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.020 align:middle line:84%
I decided that
all the approaches

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
we had taken before
obviously weren't working.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Something had to change.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I felt like we had been going
about my treatment the entirely

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.050 align:middle line:90%
wrong way.

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So as my family and I
were doing research,

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
we came across me
as for cancer cures.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.530 align:middle line:84%
We came across much information
that worked for some people,

01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
the same thing didn't
work for other people.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
We really didn't know
which way to turn.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.270 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what to take,
we didn't know what to believe.

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
One thing we all do is
read the book "Cancer-Free"

01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
of Bill Henderson, which
describes the battle that he

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
went through with his wife
during her cancer treatments.

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And it also is a
very informal book

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
of how to find
supplements, how to find

01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
other ways of treating your
cancer even in conjunction

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:34.670 align:middle line:90%
treatment, with chemotherapy.

01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.770 align:middle line:84%
But before I started
chemo, I decided

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to focus on one
supplement in the book

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and order it to begin that
settlement before I even

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.880 align:middle line:90%
began chemo treatments.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
That supplement was
called Beat 1 3D Glucan.

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:52.010 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have any idea if
this supplement was helping me

01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:53.450 align:middle line:10%
at all in the beginning.

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:56.000 align:middle line:10%
There wasn't necessarily
a way to measure it.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.810 align:middle line:10%
What I did know is that I had
put off my chemo treatments

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:01.070 align:middle line:10%
at the time.

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
I was still having
blood tests done

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and the blood tests, the CEA
blood test count numbers,

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
were showing that
it was dropping even

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.110 align:middle line:90%
without chemo treatments.

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:14.570 align:middle line:84%
This was unexplained
by my oncologist.

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Once I stopped the
IV chemo treatments

01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and I continued
taking Beta Glucan,

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
the numbers still
continued to drop,

01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
even though I was
not on the chemo that

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.990 align:middle line:90%
should remove cancer.

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to do a PET scan
after just six weeks of the IV

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
chemo since I could
no longer tolerate it.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
The scan came back showing
no signs of cancer.

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:40.560 align:middle line:90%
This was remarkable.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.160 align:middle line:90%
It was truly amazing.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea how six
oncologists could tell me,

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:48.510 align:middle line:84%
you will never be
cancer-free again;

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.340 align:middle line:90%
you will not survive this.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
To this day, they cannot explain
what happened to my cancer,

01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
where it went, or
why it is still gone.

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:02.980 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea why I am
cancer-free at this point.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:06.240 align:middle line:84%
The one consistent item
during all this time,

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.990 align:middle line:84%
during the last four and a half
years of being cancer-free,

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
is my diet, which has been
changed to a very healthy diet.

01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
It's related to, I
believe, my supplements

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:18.210 align:middle line:90%
that I've been taking.

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And I strongly believe it's
related to taking the Beta 1 3D

01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Glucan.

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Whenever newly diagnosed
cancer patients talk to me

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
about their health
and what they can

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:32.080 align:middle line:84%
do to change their health, even
in combination with their chemo

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.500 align:middle line:84%
or radiation treatments,
even in combination

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.770 align:middle line:84%
with their surgeries, I tell
them the number one item

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that I suggest is
the Beta 1 3D Glucan.

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I found locally.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
It can be ordered out of the
Marietta, Georgia office.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
It can also be online
at betterwayhealth.com.

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I prefer to buy local and
it worked out great for me

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:53.710 align:middle line:90%
in my case.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I tell them exactly
where to get it.

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:57.255 align:middle line:90%
I tell them that it's worth it.

01:04:57.255 --> 01:05:01.210 align:middle line:84%
If you have a budget, if you
have only so many things you

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
can do, this is one thing that
I believe will work for you.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.150 align:middle line:90%
It certainly helped me.

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The science couldn't explain
why my cancer was gone,

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:12.960 align:middle line:84%
but we can take our
health into our own hands.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.227 align:middle line:90%
