00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back everyone.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Ty Bollinger, here.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Last night, we had some
amazing information

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.815 align:middle line:84%
that we learned about
the immune system.

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:84%
We heard from
doctors that talked

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:84%
about how if you have a
fully intact immune system,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.129 align:middle line:84%
that cancer is
almost impossible.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
We learned about what
the immune system is.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
We learned about natural killer
cells, and B lymphocytes,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.427 align:middle line:84%
and T lymphocytes,
and macrophages.

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And maybe a whole
bunch of other terms

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.679 align:middle line:84%
that you may have
never heard before.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
We learned about
sugar and the effect

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
that that has on the
immune system, not only

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.110 align:middle line:84%
the fact that it
compromises immunity,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.072 align:middle line:90%
but it also feeds cancer cells.

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And we also learned about
the fact that the big three

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.740 align:middle line:84%
treatments, specifically
chemo and radiation--

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.590 align:middle line:84%
they devastate
the immune system.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.277 align:middle line:84%
How can that be a
treatment for cancer?

00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:84%
How can that be an
effective treatment

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
for cancer in light of
the fact that it actually

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:84%
compromises the only system that
your body has to protect you?

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't make sense to me.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, we're going to learn
about specifics that can cause

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:90%
compromised immune systems.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn
about vaccines,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified
foods, aspartame, fluoride,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.950 align:middle line:90%
pesticides.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
All these things that can
devastate the immune system.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.932 align:middle line:90%

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I was recently at a
conference in Washington DC,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.556 align:middle line:84%
and I was privileged to be
able to sit down and talk

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:90%
to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Tenpenny, has been
researching vaccines

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
for over two decades,
and I was really

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:84%
thrilled to be able to sit down
and get her opinion on vaccines

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and the toxicity
that they can cause.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And the way that they can
compromise the immune system,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
making you potentially
more vulnerable to cancer.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.654 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a listen.

00:01:56.654 --> 00:01:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm really hoping that
perhaps there are starting

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to be some cracks in the dam to
where we will get to the bottom

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:90%
of how vaccines are not safe.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:90%
They are not effective.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
They do not protect you,
and they definitely do harm.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.324 align:middle line:10%
>> Now you mentioned that one
of your goals is to educate,

00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:10%
and that's our goal as well.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:10%
So educate the viewers here,
how are vaccines dangerous?

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.935 align:middle line:90%
How are they doing harm?

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:90%
How are they not effective?

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if you listen to most
conventional medical doctors,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.710 align:middle line:90%
they'll say, oh, of course.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.461 align:middle line:90%
You need to get vaccinated.

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do your
child harm if you don't.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:90%
So how is that?

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's just amazing to
me how we think we can inject

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
something that's never been
tested for carcinogenicity.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Never been tested to
see if it's mutagenic,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:90%
which changes your DNA.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Never know whether or not it can
cause any autoimmune diseases,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
but we can perfectly say
that it's safe and effective

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.150 align:middle line:90%
and causes no harm.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
If somebody died and made me
health czar tomorrow, what

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I would do is I would round
up all the medical doctors,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:90%
all of them.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And I would put them in
a big football stadium,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and have them read all
of the package inserts.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:90%
Particularly the pediatricians.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Read the VAERS report from the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:90%
System.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:10%
And then take an entire
test, a written test,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:10%
on immunology to
prove that they know

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:10%
something about the human body.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And then have them,
with good conscience,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
say that what we are injecting
into human beings is harmless.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>> They probably couldn't do it.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.617 align:middle line:90%
>> It would be impossible.

00:03:23.617 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But that would change everything
overnight, wouldn't it?

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.190 align:middle line:84%
If suddenly we forced
physicians to look

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.984 align:middle line:84%
at the truth about
these injectables.

00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Because all they're
really dealing

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.983 align:middle line:84%
with these things
is trying to prevent

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
diseases that are a
fever, a cough, a rash,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:90%
and some diarrhea.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.790 align:middle line:84%
For what kind of harm
that we're causing?

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, look
at the HPV vaccine.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
On the package
insert, it says it may

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:90%
cause other kinds of cancers.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And we already know that it
has, through the VAERS report,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.063 align:middle line:84%
that there have been
many girls who've

00:03:52.063 --> 00:03:54.090 align:middle line:84%
been fully vaccinated
with the HPV vaccine

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that within three months
to about two years

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
that are diagnosed with
cervical cancer, massive cases

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:90%
of venereal warts.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We know that less than 4% of
the women in the United States

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
have actually ever been
exposed to the two viruses that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:90%
are in the vaccine.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So if the vaccine did anything--
which it doesn't, and it can

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:90%
cause a lot of harm--

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
there are at least
eight strains of HPV--

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
Human Papillomavirus-- that are
supposed to be associated with,

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
or are known to be
associated, with cancer.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But the vaccine only
covers two of them.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:10%
So it gives this false
sense of security

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:10%
to moms who think they're
protecting their girls to think

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.276 align:middle line:10%
they won't get cancer.

00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And that will say to
the girls, well, I

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:84%
don't need to get a pap test
because I've been protect it.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are other strains
that can cause the cancer.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things you
said earlier about that most

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.028 align:middle line:84%
vaccines, or all vaccines,
have not been tested

00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:90%
for carcinogenicity--

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I only got it right once.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.380 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can say it today.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.042 align:middle line:84%
That's shocking, in light of
the fact that you're saying

00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:90%
that they've not been tested.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.874 align:middle line:84%
The ingredients in
the vaccine have not

00:04:53.874 --> 00:04:56.395 align:middle line:84%
been tested to see if they
could cause cancer, especially

00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
in light of the fact of
you look at the ingredients

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.305 align:middle line:84%
in some of these vaccines today,
and it's a virtual who's who

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:90%
of poisons.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:10%
And there's several things
that really continue-- well,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.090 align:middle line:10%
all of it concerns me,
but to your point--

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.940 align:middle line:10%
formaldehyde is used
in the DPT vaccines

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:10%
and in the polio vaccines.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And we've said known for years
that formaldehyde can cause

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of health problems.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And that the amount of
formaldehyde exposure, even

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
through ambient air that
you come in contact with

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.072 align:middle line:84%
or that you breathe in, very,
very small particulate amounts

00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:32.030 align:middle line:84%
have known to cause lots
of different problems,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:90%
including cancer.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was only about
two, three years ago

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.820 align:middle line:84%
now that they
formally said, yes,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:84%
formaldehyde will be added to
the list of known carcinogens.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But yet we continue to
have known carcinogens

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
in the vaccines, and
have them not be removed.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And they've been injected
for 50 years or more.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's worse than
they've not been

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:90%
tested for carcinogenicity--

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.520 align:middle line:90%
I got it right.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:84%
They have been
tested, and they--

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:84%
>> At least some of the
ingredients are shown to be

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:90%
known carcinogens.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>> There are also stray viruses
that end up in these vaccines.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And they end up in the
vaccines, because a virus,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.970 align:middle line:84%
in order to replicate, needs to
be embedded into a living cell.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they use these cells
to grow these large quantities

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
of viruses, for which
then they harvest

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and run them through a
long line of chemicals

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
to weaken them to put
them into the vaccines.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, the polio vaccine has
been known for many, many years

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to have a virus in it called
SV40, which stands for Simian

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Virus 40, because those
polio vaccines are

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:90%
made from monkey kidneys cells.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And so simian virus
is a monkey virus.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And in 2002, The Lancet
published a paper that said it

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:84%
was suspected that more than
half of the 55,000 cases

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
that were out there,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.880 align:middle line:84%
with a very high probability,
could be associated with

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
the SV40 vaccine
from the polio--

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.439 align:middle line:84%
the SV40 virus from
the polio vaccine.

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's something in
the published literature--

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:90%
that was in The Lancet.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:90%
That came out in 2002.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:10%
There's two other
stray viruses that

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:10%
end up in there from
avian cells, which

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.870 align:middle line:10%
are all the vaccines
that are made from eggs.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:10%
Because they're passed
down through the chickens,

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:10%
and they get into their eggs.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
different viruses

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.600 align:middle line:84%
that are known to be
associated with breast cancer.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I've written a couple
of articles about that.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Formaldehyde is a
known carcinogen,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:90%
yet it's still in vaccines.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:84%
Simian Virus 40, SV40, which
tainted the polio vaccine,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
according to The
Lancet, has caused

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
over half of the 55,000 cases
of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.090 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different toxic
heavy metals and carcinogens

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:90%
that are still in vaccines.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.646 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk to Robert Scott
Bell about that topic.

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>> The other aspect of this,
which is very controversial,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
although we do cover
it, is vaccination.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
They sacrifice
children on the altar

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
of this church of
pharmaceutical mysticism,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
with the needles of big
pharma, as I call it.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:10%
They argue that the only
way we can survive childhood

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.340 align:middle line:10%
is to somehow elicit
an artificial antibody

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:10%
response by injecting
toxic poisons that you

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't put in the
bottle of that same baby

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:10%
to make them drink.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.443 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you did, you might
be charged with a crime--

00:08:15.443 --> 00:08:16.710 align:middle line:90%
attempted murder.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
But yet they
institutionalize this concept

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
of injecting little
babies with this.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
really it's a cult.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a dangerous death
cult, allopathic medicine.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not
to say they're not

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
good at putting Humpty
Dumpty back together again.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.750 align:middle line:84%
That is where they excel--
emergency trauma medicine.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.490 align:middle line:84%
I don't take anything
away from them

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:90%
in that regard and their skill.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
managing chronic diseases

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.934 align:middle line:84%
that they create, it is
an absolute disaster.

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And you want to
get out of it-- we

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:84%
need to get out of it-- if we're
going to not only heal cancer

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
really, but prevent it
from ever having to happen.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.450 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't have to happen.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk about some of the
chemicals in the vaccines.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of the additives,
the adjuments,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and other ingredients that
might be carcinogenic.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:59.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I think the biggest one--

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:84%
well, the class of
them are heavy metals.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:90%
Mercury, a number one.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in a
Homeopathic Materia Medica,

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.270 align:middle line:84%
there are pages and
pages and pages,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:84%
almost more than any
other, let's say,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:84%
substance listed in
that Materia Medica

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:84%
of potential effects and actual
effects at even minute doses.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Minute exposure to mercury.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And this affects every system
of the body-- the endocrine,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
the neurological
system, you name it.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:84%
The digestive system,
the epithelial tissue.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is the
biggest baddie of them

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.917 align:middle line:84%
all, and ultimately I
believe facilitates cancer.

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And the interesting
thing about these vaccines,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.570 align:middle line:84%
these drugs, is that most of
the time they're FDA approved,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.370 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
The FDA says they're perfectly
fine to take and give.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And there have never
been any double blind,

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:84%
placebo controlled
crossover center studies

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
to determine safety or efficacy
of any of these vaccines.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So for them to claim that they
actually work, based on what?

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.592 align:middle line:90%
Anecdote.

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.050 align:middle line:84%
They claim it, and they say,
well, it's good enough for us.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And you point out that
the double blind, placebo

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:84%
controlled studies have not
been done, they yell at you

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.331 align:middle line:84%
and scream at you
and call you names.

00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And say, that would
be unscientific--

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:84%
or no, that would be
unethical to do that.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:10%
In the meantime,
there are thousands

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.418 align:middle line:10%
of families around
the country that

00:10:08.418 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:10%
would be happy to
volunteer information

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.400 align:middle line:10%
about the health
of their children

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.941 align:middle line:10%
who have not been
vaccinated, so they

00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:15.960 align:middle line:10%
can do cross comparative
studies looking back.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how they
do these studies.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:90%
Yet they claim they can't do it.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.114 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
do it, because they'd

00:10:21.114 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:84%
the children who have not
been assaulted in this way

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.540 align:middle line:84%
by a syringe are much healthier,
and they have fewer and fewer

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:90%
chronic disease.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So mercury is in vaccines, but
we know that it causes cancer.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Tenpenny talked
about at least a couple

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:84%
of ingredients that are in
other vaccines that we know

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
have been linked
to breast cancer.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk to Dr.
Veronique Desaulniers, who

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
cured her own breast cancer,
about the environmental toxins

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:84%
that can cause DNA damage and
compromise our immune system

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.390 align:middle line:90%
and potentially lead to cancer.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Environmental toxicity
plays a huge role.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact--

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.260 align:middle line:10%
and I was shocked when
I heard these numbers--

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:10%
that the EPA
estimates that there

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:10%
are 74 billion
pounds of chemicals

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:10%
being produced every day.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Every day, in the
United States alone.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> 74 billion pounds?

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Per day, in the
United States alone.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.840 align:middle line:84%
How do we wrap our
brain around that?

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you look at
environmental toxicity,

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:90%
it's a huge issue.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Because many of those
chemicals have infiltrated,

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned, our water
supply, our food supply,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:90%
the air we breathe.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And many of them cause
cancer, and many of them

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.710 align:middle line:84%
mimic estrogen,
which drives cancer.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And many of them mimic hormone
disruptors in the body,

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:90%
so they cause a lot of problems.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
The CDC did a study
about 10 years ago

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
where they took samples
of blood, urine,

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and saliva of over 2,000
people in the United States.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And they found, on average, 212
chemicals in people's bodies.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So what does the
body do with that?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Over 212 chemicals
that the body has

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
to process and figure out what
to do with and try to expel.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So that chemical
stress is really

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
compromising the immune system,
and putting a lot of stress

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.630 align:middle line:84%
on the excretory
organs of the body.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Which leads to DNA
damage and more cancers.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
On average 212 chemicals
in people's bodies?

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.642 align:middle line:90%
That's really mind blowing.

00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
that we're actually

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
as healthy as we
are, being overloaded

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:90%
with all these chemicals.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And while I was in
Atlanta talking to Dr. V,

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I was also able to
interview Dr. David Jockers.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So let's listen in
to that conversation.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.490 align:middle line:84%
What effect do these
toxicities, do you believe,

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:90%
play in the cancer equation?

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look
at 100 years ago,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have the
same massive amounts

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.980 align:middle line:90%
of environmental toxins.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe
on that topic?

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe they play
a huge role with this.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:10%
We have over 80,000
chemicals in our society.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:10%
The average individual
in our society

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:10%
urinates out seven pesticides
every time they urinate.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they did a
study several years ago

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:84%
where they took 10
newborn infants,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and they measured their
umbilical cord blood

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:90%
for toxins.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And they found 280--

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:84%
the mean, the average--
was 287 toxic chemicals.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.000 align:middle line:84%
208 of those were
carcinogenic for the body.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:90%
And this is a newborn infant.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is not something
that you believe--

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:84%
research has shown
that these toxins

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:84%
are getting into the
systems and causing damage.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
empirical evidence

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:84%
that's showing that these
toxins are wreaking havoc

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:90%
on our physiology.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>> What we do know, from all the
science that's been published

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:10%
from the cancer industry, we
know that we live in a world

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.146 align:middle line:10%
that's full of cancer
causing toxins.

00:13:44.146 --> 00:13:45.270 align:middle line:90%
They're in the environment.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:84%
They're in the air we breathe.
they're in the water we drink.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
They're sprayed on
the food we eat.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.150 align:middle line:84%
We're eating a
nutrient deficient

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:84%
food that's mostly man-made,
processed junk food, right?

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So all of these factors
are all physical factors

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.380 align:middle line:84%
that affect the
health of your body,

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately suppress
your immune system

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.929 align:middle line:84%
and create an environment
where cancer cells can thrive.

00:14:10.929 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> They're adding more of the
toxic pollutants that your body

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is then having to give up the
minerals to neutralize, bind,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.386 align:middle line:84%
and excrete, and get
it out of the body.

00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:10%
So as you deplete
those minerals,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.968 align:middle line:10%
you have less of the defense.

00:14:21.968 --> 00:14:25.680 align:middle line:10%
Your immune system
becomes more deregulated.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.407 align:middle line:84%
And now the toxins can
proliferate unabated.

00:14:29.407 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, they impact
the metabolic functioning

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:84%
of every cell in the
body, or specific areas.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
If you have enough
strength to mobilize

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
those toxic poisons
in those cells,

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:84%
you might wall it
off in a tumor.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times now we see
a systemic growth of cancer,

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
because we no longer have
certain minerals like silica,

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:84%
which are critical for
connective tissue integrity.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is what keeps
a tumor, let's say,

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.219 align:middle line:84%
or a cancerous growth
from metastasizing.

00:14:54.219 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Because it chews through
connective tissue in this way.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of
aspects to that toxin factor,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
but you can't disconnect it
from the nutrient factor,

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:90%
the mineral factor.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.247 align:middle line:90%
So they go hand in hand.

00:15:05.247 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robert Scott
Bell mentioned nutrients

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:90%
and minerals.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you a question--

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
what if your food
wasn't really food,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't contain the
nutrients and minerals

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.060 align:middle line:90%
that you thought it contained?

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to some
jaw dropping information

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.830 align:middle line:84%
from Jeffrey Smith, the
world's most renowned expert

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:84%
on genetically modified
foods, also known as GMO.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:90%
What are GMOs?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Genetically
Modified Organisms.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
You take genes from one
species, and force it

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:90%
into the DNA of other species.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, the GM crops
on the market--

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:10%
there's nine of them--

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:10%
and the primary traits are
either herbicide tolerance

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.480 align:middle line:10%
or pesticide production.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:90%
So herbicide tolerance--

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Roundup Ready is
the most popular.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Roundup Ready soy, corn,
cotton, canola, sugar beets,

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.250 align:middle line:90%
and alfalfa.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
They're engineered with genes
from bacteria and pieces

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:90%
of virus, et cetera, not to die.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
The plant doesn't die when it's
sprayed with Roundup herbicide,

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:90%
which normally kills plants.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So it makes weeding
easier for farmers.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:84%
They can simply spray over the
crops, and kill all the weeds.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
But not the Roundup Ready crops.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And the other genetically
modified trait that's popular

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
is pesticide production.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:84%
They take a gene from bacteria
in the soil called Bacillus

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.680 align:middle line:90%
thuringiensis, or BT for short.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And take that gene, which
produces a known insecticide,

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.570 align:middle line:90%
and put it into corn and cotton.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So when a bug,
certain types of bugs,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.040 align:middle line:84%
eat or try to bite the plant,
the toxin gets released

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and then it breaks open little
holes in their stomach walls

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:90%
and they die.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So now we eat that
insecticide, and we also

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:90%
eat the Roundup laden crops.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're eating two types of
poisons in these GM crops.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:84%
The FDA does not require a
single safety study on GMOs.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was determined
in a policy in 1992 that

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
was overseen by Michael Taylor.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Michael Taylor is the
former attorney to Monsanto.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
And he was given a position that
was designed for him by the FDA

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
when the agency was told by the
White House to promote GMOs.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And Taylor's policy
falsely claimed

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that the agency wasn't aware of
information showing that GMOs

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:84%
were significantly
different, therefore

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
no testing or labeling
was necessary.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.569 align:middle line:84%
Companies like Monsanto
could determine on their own

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:90%
if their GMO is safe.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And Monsanto told us that
Agent Orange and PCBs and DDT

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:90%
were safe, and got that wrong.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they'll get
it right with GMOs

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:90%
is the thinking by the FDA.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Taylor then became
Monsanto's vice president

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:90%
and chief lobbyist.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:10%
Now he's back at the FDA
as the US food safety czar.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost like you have
the fox guarding the hen house.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>> It's more than almost.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
We have a situation where the
claims in the policy that they

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:84%
weren't aware of information
showing that GMOs were

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:90%
different was a complete lie.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:90%
It was a total fabrication.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
The lawsuit forced
44,000 secret FDA memos

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
into the public
domain, and it showed

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that the overwhelming consensus
among the scientists working

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:84%
at the FDA was
exactly the opposite.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:84%
They said GMOs might
create allergens, toxins,

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:84%
new diseases, and
nutritional problems.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Urged their superiors
to require testing.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Complained about the
draft of the policy.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And their concerns were
ignored, and even denied.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you say that
they are not significantly--

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.698 align:middle line:84%
at least Monsanto said they
are not significantly different

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:90%
than what?

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Than normal foods.

00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Than normal food.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.976 align:middle line:84%
>> So since they're not
significantly different than

00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
normal food, they don't need to
tell us that they're doing this

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:90%
to foods?

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't need to tell us.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to test it.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.186 align:middle line:84%
They can just put
it on the market

00:18:47.186 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:90%
and assume that it's safe.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And if they want to do
tests, they can do tests.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.558 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't-- and
the tests that they do?

00:18:52.558 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:90%
Tobacco science.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.313 align:middle line:84%
Completely rigged to
avoid finding problems.

00:18:55.313 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:90%
We catch them red handed.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So the only testing that is
required are self tests that

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:90%
they submit.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.209 align:middle line:90%
And then of course--

00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> They can submit
them if they want,

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and they usually if they
do, submit just summaries.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.060 align:middle line:84%
They will never give a
reviewer enough information

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:90%
to determine safety.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And so the tests--

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
the tests typically on
animals end in 90 days.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:10%
So you feed an animal,
a rat for example,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.180 align:middle line:10%
let's say 33% of its
diet is a genetically

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:10%
modified corn for 90 days.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:10%
And if it looks
good after 90 days,

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.920 align:middle line:10%
you feed it to humans
for their entire lives.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, a research team
headed by Dr. Seralini,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
decided to extend the study
of 90 days to two years--

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:84%
the approximate
lifespan of a rat.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, Seralini had been
reviewing the submissions

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to France and to the
European Union by Monsanto,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and saw that Roundup
Ready corn fed to rats

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
showed more than 50 different
statistically significant

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
changes in the animals
compared to the control.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.679 align:middle line:84%
And Monsanto said,
there's no problem.

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And Seralini says, what do
you mean there's no problem?

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:90%
This is very serious.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And published it
showing that there

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:84%
was a very significant
signs of toxicity.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So he secretly
extended the study

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.690 align:middle line:84%
using the same type of rats,
the same control group size,

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.170 align:middle line:84%
but many, many more parameters
that they tested for.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And starting after the 90
days, in the next month,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
the first rat started
to get tumors.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And by the end, up to
80% of the female rats

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
had tumors, almost all of
them mammary glands tumors.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Up to 50% of the
male rats had tumors.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Compared to far less
in the controls.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
That's truly staggering
information from Mr. Smith.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
The Seralini study did show
that the GMO corn was causing

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:90%
premature death and cancer.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Now that's important to me,
because I've got four kids

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and I want them to be
healthy and to live

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.572 align:middle line:90%
a long, healthy life.

00:20:58.572 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Even more alarming is
the fact that there

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.432 align:middle line:84%
is no testing that is required
for genetically modified foods.

00:21:03.432 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
deemed to be substantially

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:84%
equivalent to regular food, and
so we don't need to test them.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, who was in charge of this
substantial equivalent policy?

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Michael Taylor, at
Monsanto, was the man

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
responsible for this
substantial equivalent policy.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Michael Taylor is now the Deputy
Commissioner for Food Safety.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:84%
He's our food safety czar
for the United States.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.850 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems like the fox
is guarding the hen house.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Despite the fact that there
are over 44,000 documents,

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.900 align:middle line:84%
even corroborated by the
FDA's own scientists,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:84%
which said exactly
the opposite--

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:84%
that genetically
modified foods are not

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:90%
substantially equivalent.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So while I was in
Las Vegas, I met up

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.590 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Keith Scott-Mumby
to get his input on some

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:90%
of the causes of cancer.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to fix causes, and
of course cancer has causes.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:90%
And here's another problem--

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:90%
it's a multi-factorial disease.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, you know, malaria
where the cause is a mosquito

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:90%
bite and this Plasmodium.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not that simple.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:90%
There are many, many causes.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:90%
My three pillars--

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.170 align:middle line:84%
I call it the Three Pillars
of Healing in cancer.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:10%
Emotions, which
I've talked about.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.205 align:middle line:10%
We barely mentioned
chemical overload,

00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:18.090 align:middle line:10%
but our environment now is full
of carcinogenic substances.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
We're awash, literally,
with carcinogens.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.437 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are choices, and
best not used, like cosmetics.

00:22:24.437 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I love to see the
gals looking pretty.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:84%
You've seen my wife--
she's beautiful.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So you like them to
look good, but you

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.004 align:middle line:84%
know most of what women put
on their skin, it's dangerous.

00:22:36.004 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
I think the average
woman would probably

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:84%
do less if they realized that
they absorb about two pounds--

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:84%
that's around a
kilogram-- of cosmetics

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:90%
through their skin every year.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
That's two pounds of sludge and
slime, toxic sludge and slime,

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.212 align:middle line:84%
that you're body has
got to deal with.

00:22:51.212 --> 00:22:53.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, you weren't given a
liver to deal with cosmetics.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed
to deal with foods

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and environmental factors,
not man-made synthetics,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.270 align:middle line:90%
such as now.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So our skin absorbs the
toxins from the makeups

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and the cosmetic
products that we wear.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
What about the
foods that we eat?

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.030 align:middle line:84%
The vegetables, the
fruits that have

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.210 align:middle line:84%
been sprayed with
pesticides and insecticides?

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:84%
They absorb those toxins,
and then we eat them.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.032 align:middle line:84%
What kind of an effect
does that have on us?

00:23:18.032 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to a
couple of experts chime

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.880 align:middle line:90%
in on this subject.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk about
pesticides and cancer.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I have heard

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.680 align:middle line:84%
thus far from other
doctors is that pesticides

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:84%
have an estrogenic
effect on the body.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.360 align:middle line:90%
So can you talk about that?

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:10%
We talk about disrupting
endocrine integrity,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:10%
endocrine disruptors.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.475 align:middle line:10%
Now, the hormonal system
is a brilliant system.

00:23:36.475 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you're talking
about substances

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:10%
that can be found in your
body at parts per million,

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:10%
parts per billion,
parts per 150 billion.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's not a lot
compared to everything else

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:46.656 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:23:46.656 --> 00:23:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Yet you put these pesticides
in there, some of them

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:53.310 align:middle line:84%
will outright destroy a hormone,
for instance, on contact.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But in many ways,
some of them are

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
mimicking, because
that's the way they

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.630 align:middle line:84%
work in the natural
world to disrupt

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.559 align:middle line:84%
the insect reproductive
system and such.

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have that larger effect
in the macro environment,

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.112 align:middle line:90%
or in our environment.

00:24:04.112 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we alter the
endocrine function,

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.850 align:middle line:84%
we disrupt normal
matter metabolic

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.940 align:middle line:84%
processes that keep us up
and functioning and vital.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this also
relates to enzymes,

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:17.890 align:middle line:84%
because these pesticides,
as well as being endocrine

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.939 align:middle line:84%
disruptors, they
destroy the enzymes

00:24:19.939 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
that are the essential
tools of life.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.300 align:middle line:84%
That also are found in the
body at very minute levels,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.210 align:middle line:84%
relative to the entire content
of the body's liquid mineral,

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.440 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, content.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And so at parts
per million, these

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
pesticides not only disrupt
the endocrine integrity,

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:84%
but destroy enzymes
and our ability

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.950 align:middle line:84%
to break things down
and bind things out.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's a corruption,
a vicious corruption,

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:84%
not only of the food supply,
but our own functional integrity

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.700 align:middle line:84%
that gives rise to
the very cancers

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:90%
that we're trying to prevent.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Which is again, why I say
you've got to clean up

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.431 align:middle line:90%
what goes into your body.

00:24:52.431 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:84%
You cannot subsist on pesticide
laden foods and overcome

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:90%
cancer, ultimately.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:10%
>> We dump two billion pounds
of pesticides, herbicides,

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:05.130 align:middle line:10%
and fungicides on our
fresh produce every year.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And none of that's good for us.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And one might argue
that it's bad for us.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Some of those are neurotoxins.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Fungicides are
poisons in general.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you a question.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.280 align:middle line:84%
What if the foods
that you're eating

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.840 align:middle line:84%
were actually creating a virtual
pesticide factory in your gut?

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
interview with Jeffrey Smith,

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and find out what he has
to say about Roundup,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.380 align:middle line:84%
which is a pesticide,
and the effects

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:90%
that it has on your body.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Roundup can promote
cancer in many, many ways.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:10%
First of all, it's
an antibiotic.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And it kills off
beneficial gut bacteria,

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:84%
causing an overgrowth
of the bad gut bacteria.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, this overgrowth of
negative gut bacteria

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.950 align:middle line:90%
is linked to certain cancers--

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:90%
colorectal cancer, for example.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.590 align:middle line:84%
The overgrowth of
negative gut bacteria

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.770 align:middle line:84%
can produce zonulin, which
can create leaky gut.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:84%
It opens the gaps in the
cell walls on the intestines.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And leaky gut is
linked to cancer.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Roundup also damages
a set of enzymes

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
called the CYP enzymes, which
are part of the detoxification

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.250 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And CYP enzymes are
linked to cancer.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the problems
with Roundup is

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.330 align:middle line:84%
it can disable some of
those enzymes that are

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:23.500 align:middle line:90%
involved with detoxification.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So any toxic influence
from the environment

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.980 align:middle line:84%
can be much more
toxic when you're also

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.160 align:middle line:84%
exposed to Roundup, or its
active ingredient-- glyphosate.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Through the gut
bacteria overgrowth,

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
that can promote
inflammation in the gut.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And inflammation is
also linked to cancer.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So Roundup has all
these different ways,

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:90%
like a perfect storm.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are
certain tissues that

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
are the target
tissues for Roundup,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and it accumulates
in those tissues.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And those are the cancers
that are on the rise in the US

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:90%
population.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.155 align:middle line:84%
For example, thyroid
cancer, liver cancer,

00:26:57.155 --> 00:26:58.380 align:middle line:90%
and kidney cancer.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, the BT toxin
produced by the corn,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:84%
because it promotes allergic
reactions or immune system

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
reactions in humans and animals,
can create inflammation.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And again inflammation,
is linked to cancer.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, the BT toxin,
it's interesting.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.960 align:middle line:84%
They found the BT
toxin and Roundup

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
in the blood of pregnant
women tested in Canada.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, 93% of
the pregnant women

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.930 align:middle line:84%
had BT toxin in their
blood, and so too did

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:90%
80% of their unborn fetuses.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.280 align:middle line:10%
Now, the BT toxin may
have gotten into the blood

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:10%
through the leaky gut that it
itself created by poking holes

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.170 align:middle line:10%
in the cell walls.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.230 align:middle line:10%
If it gets in the blood,
it can be cytotoxic,

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.030 align:middle line:10%
damaging the red blood cells.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And this was found in
the case of a mouse

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
study, where BT toxin
damaged the red blood cells.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.150 align:middle line:84%
If it gets into the
fetus, the fetus

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.650 align:middle line:84%
don't have blood brain
barriers well developed.

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So it might end up in the
brains of the fetuses.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So you have a whole
poking toxin in the brains

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:84%
of the next generation
in North America.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.830 align:middle line:84%
If the BT gene transfers
to gut bacteria

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.990 align:middle line:84%
and continues to
function, it can

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:84%
convert our intestinal
flora into living pesticide

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:84%
factories, producing
BT toxin 24/7.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Which might poke holes along
the cell walls, causing

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.600 align:middle line:84%
inflammation and all sorts of
gastrointestinal disorders.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Possibly creating leaky gut,
which is also linked to cancer.

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And that might explain, this
production of the BT toxin,

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:84%
why 93% of the pregnant
women tested in Canada

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.630 align:middle line:90%
had it in their blood.

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
producing it in their gut.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:45.620 align:middle line:84%
As far as the gut bacteria, it
is now a huge topic of study.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's into
the microbiome now.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.070 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's the new tofu.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's into the microbiome.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a situation
where the devastation of Roundup

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:84%
becomes bigger and bigger
the more they realize this.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Because it is a
potent antibiotic,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.920 align:middle line:90%
but it is selective.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.972 align:middle line:84%
It kills the lactobacillus
and the bifidobacteria--

00:29:07.972 --> 00:29:09.180 align:middle line:90%
the stuff that's good for us.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The ones that
you want in yogurt.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The stuff that you're
buying and paying for.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.864 align:middle line:84%
And then you wash it down with
something with Roundup in it,

00:29:14.864 --> 00:29:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and you just kill
everything you've just

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:17.910 align:middle line:90%
put in there plus more.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And it allows the
overgrowth of salmonella,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.160 align:middle line:90%
or botulism, or E. coli--

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.972 align:middle line:90%
the negative stuff.

00:29:23.972 --> 00:29:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you this.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So you talked about
the Roundup Ready

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:84%
corn and the soy potentially
sprayed with Roundup.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Do they use Roundup
or glyphosate

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.789 align:middle line:84%
on other non-organic
vegetables as well?

00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just the corn and soy?

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:10%
It's used as a ripening agent.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:10%
They spray it on wheat, on
barley, on rye, on lentils,

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:50.040 align:middle line:10%
on sweet potatoes,
on sugar cane.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
There's 160 or so different
fruits, vegetables, grains,

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:84%
beans, et cetera that are
allowed high residues, because

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.360 align:middle line:84%
of this now practice of using
it as what's called a desiccant,

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.680 align:middle line:90%
or a ripening agent.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.707 align:middle line:84%
Not every farmer uses it, but
it's hard to tell where it is

00:30:07.707 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and where it isn't
because it's not labeled.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.822 align:middle line:84%
So that's why buying
organic is much safer.

00:30:11.822 --> 00:30:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you this.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the common
arguments that you

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.880 align:middle line:84%
get from those that are
producing the GMO crops

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we need this
to feed the world.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:84%
They need it to
pay their salaries.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:30.726 align:middle line:84%
GMOs are so inept at feeding
the world that the biggest paper

00:30:30.726 --> 00:30:32.100 align:middle line:84%
in the world, the
biggest study--

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:84%
more than 400 scientists,
sponsored by the UN and signed

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:90%
on by more than 58 countries--

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:84%
concluded that the
current generation of GMOs

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.720 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to offer
feeding the hungry world,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:84%
eradicating poverty, or creating
sustainable agriculture.

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the ISTAD report.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.481 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Union of
Concerned Scientists study

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:51.480 align:middle line:84%
showed that it actually
doesn't increase yields.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And the USDA recent
study verified

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.670 align:middle line:84%
that GMOs do not increase
yields, and in many cases

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.400 align:middle line:90%
reduce yields.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So we actually don't need
GMOs to feed the world.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:84%
They produce less yields
than normal crops.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Not something you're going
to hear from the mainstream.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Back in the spring
on a Doctor Oz show

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I saw the Health
Ranger, Mike Adams,

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.590 align:middle line:84%
being interviewed about
the poisons and the toxins

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and the heavy metals
in our food supply.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to get his take on
this vitally important issue,

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and also about genetically
modified foods.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.742 align:middle line:10%
>> The legitimate
scientific question is,

00:31:22.742 --> 00:31:24.950 align:middle line:10%
what is the long term
implication on humans when they

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.910 align:middle line:10%
eat this chemical that
is a deadly chemical?

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.830 align:middle line:10%
The GMO biotech industry
absolutely does not

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:10%
want you to ask the question.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.710 align:middle line:84%
They routinely intimidate
and threaten scientists

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:38.835 align:middle line:90%
that explore this question.

00:31:38.835 --> 00:31:41.220 align:middle line:84%
They intimidate and
threaten activists.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.830 align:middle line:84%
They engage in
character assassination,

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.780 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of things that
most of your viewers

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.113 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't even believe if I
told you the truth about what

00:31:48.113 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:90%
they do behind the scenes.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.630 align:middle line:90%
They operate like a mafia.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:55.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's a mafia to
protect the mythology

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.490 align:middle line:90%
that GMOs are not dangerous.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.332 align:middle line:84%
>> But clearly,
if you eat poison,

00:32:03.332 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:84%
you might want to be concerned
about what the effects would

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:06.590 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But in my view, that's not
even the biggest risk of GMOs.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
The biggest risk comes from
the transgenic effects.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:84%
There is interesting new
research-- more needs

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
to be done still, but there's
early research now coming out

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that indicates that the
genetic fragments of GMO corn

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:84%
can change the expression
of your own physiology.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So that that
genetic code somehow

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:84%
combines with your
own genetic code,

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:84%
perhaps with the microbiology
of your intestinal flora.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.914 align:middle line:84%
Which then alters your
entire physiology.

00:32:43.914 --> 00:32:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It can change your
blood pressure.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.180 align:middle line:84%
It can change your
risk of heart disease.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.790 align:middle line:84%
It can alter your
gene expression.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of this may also
get into epigenetics,

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.630 align:middle line:84%
the non-physical, non-DNA
factors of gene expression

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.380 align:middle line:84%
that are now increasingly
being recognized

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:90%
by modern scientists.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So one thing-- look, we don't
have all the answers yet,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.110 align:middle line:84%
but that's exactly why
we should halt GMOs.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't know how
they might harm us.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:90%
The research hasn't been done.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.590 align:middle line:84%
The real story in this is
that we are the lab rats.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:90%
We the people.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is a long term
experiment being conducted now

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.700 align:middle line:90%
on the entire population.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Do people have more tumors
now than they used to 20 years

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:90%
ago?

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Are they getting tumors at
younger and younger ages?

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Is there more infertility
now than ever before

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.860 align:middle line:90%
in human history?

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.280 align:middle line:84%
More organ damage, more
people on dialysis,

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.110 align:middle line:84%
more people suffering from
early unexplained deaths.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Everyone seems to be sick.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:47.030 align:middle line:84%
The cancer industry
is exploding.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And the GMO industry
may in fact turn out

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:84%
to be the single best recruiting
tool for the cancer industry.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's no wonder that
they tend to operate

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.760 align:middle line:90%
in some of the same ways.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Oppression of--
scientist intimidation.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Oppression, censorship of
scientific information.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Shutting down anyone
who asks questions.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Many of the foods
that people eat today

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.730 align:middle line:84%
are contaminated
with heavy metals.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Give me an example of a
few heavy metals that you--

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.573 align:middle line:84%
So lead, arsenic,
cadmium, mercury.

00:34:17.573 --> 00:34:19.489 align:middle line:84%
Tungsten is one that
we've started to look at.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And then there are the lighter
metals, such as aluminum.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:84%
And lead is so common
in the food supply

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.860 align:middle line:84%
today, because
for over a century

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
lead arsenic was
used as a pesticide.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So you combine lead and
arsenic, you make lead arsenate.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.270 align:middle line:84%
You spray it on all the
crops, it kills the bugs.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.091 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:34:42.091 --> 00:34:43.340 align:middle line:90%
>> But what does it do to you?

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So in agricultural lands across
the world, for over 100 years

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:51.110 align:middle line:84%
lead arsenate was sprayed
on almost everything.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.739 align:middle line:90%
It was the miracle.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.670 align:middle line:84%
It was, you know, the new
science of food production.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.160 align:middle line:84%
For a few years, food
production goes up.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.027 align:middle line:84%
And then your soils
are contaminated.

00:35:00.027 --> 00:35:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And guess how long
they're contaminated for?

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:90%
1,000 years.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> They grow on forever.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.200 align:middle line:10%
So today the food
that's being grown,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:10%
that's feeding much
of our population,

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.490 align:middle line:10%
has been grown in soils
that were heavily,

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:17.090 align:middle line:10%
heavily contaminated with
lead and arsenic as spraying.

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But then we've got the
coal fired power plants

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:90%
in China and in the US.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.450 align:middle line:90%
The US plants are much cleaner.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The plants in China are
spewing out tens of thousands

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:84%
of tons of heavy metals
into the air every year.

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Mercury being
one of the big ones.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.780 align:middle line:84%
The jet stream
carries these metals

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:84%
across the Pacific
Ocean, deposits them

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:90%
over North America.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.720 align:middle line:84%
They fall onto forests of the
Pacific Northwest and northern

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.000 align:middle line:90%
They get into the soil.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.150 align:middle line:84%
The tree roots take up the
heavy metals into the leaves.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:84%
The trees growing
there now are heavily

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.560 align:middle line:84%
contaminated with mercury
and other heavy metals.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.270 align:middle line:90%
When those forests burn--

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:84%
because they do catch
fire from time to time--

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.250 align:middle line:84%
they release mercury
back into the air.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Goes across North America.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Falls onto the
breadbasket of America,

00:36:05.050 --> 00:36:07.540 align:middle line:84%
the croplands, where
our food is grown.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a relationship
between mercury and cancer?

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:36:12.082 --> 00:36:14.540 align:middle line:84%
To understand that, you have
to understand how heavy metals

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:90%
really operate in the body.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:23.900 align:middle line:84%
Heavy metals replace, they knock
out, other healthy minerals,

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and thereby replace
them on cell membranes.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So mercury, for example,
knocks out zinc.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.765 align:middle line:84%
Zinc is crucial for
immune function.

00:36:32.765 --> 00:36:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, if you want to
get really scientific about it,

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.510 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the table of
elements, mercury and zinc

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.450 align:middle line:84%
occupy the same column
of the table of elements.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.480 align:middle line:84%
The table of elements is
arranged, column by column,

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
indicative of the, say,

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:51.050 align:middle line:84%
the outer electron orbit
shell of that element

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.120 align:middle line:90%
in its monatomic form.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So to put it simply, they have
similar biochemical functions

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:90%
or properties.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.540 align:middle line:84%
They interact with
other elements,

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.900 align:middle line:84%
other metals, other
molecules in similar ways.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
mercury, you're not

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:90%
getting the zinc that you need.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And when mercury is in your
diet, it is displacing zinc.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Zinc is crucial for
immune function.

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.850 align:middle line:84%
Zinc helps prevent
cancer in many ways.

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you're eating
mercury, you're

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.510 align:middle line:90%
not getting protective zinc.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Something else that's
interesting in this--

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:90%
caesium.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Radioactive caesium isotopes
such as caesium-137, one

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:84%
of the most common and most
destructive radioisotopes.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Created in nuclear catastrophes,
and even from nuclear weapons.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Caesium-137 occupies
the same column

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:84%
on the table of
elements as potassium.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Potassium is in every
cell of your body.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:53.630 align:middle line:84%
When caesium pollutes an
agricultural area, your food,

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:58.580 align:middle line:84%
your diet, your body ultimately,
it displaces potassium.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if you know
anything about agriculture,

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.410 align:middle line:84%
you know that every
plant takes up potassium

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:90%
through its roots, right?

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the big three
fertilizers in the UK.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So potassium goes
into every plant.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Every plant then
incorporates potassium

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.539 align:middle line:84%
into its cell structure, which
becomes the food that you

00:38:15.539 --> 00:38:16.580 align:middle line:90%
eat if you eat the plant.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:84%
The grain of the corn,
the leaf of the herb,

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:84%
the root of the turnip,
whenever the case may be.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you have caesium falling
on that, caesium-137 or 134.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.010 align:middle line:84%
134 is a much shorter
lived isotope.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The normal, non-radioactive
most common isotope of caesium

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.810 align:middle line:90%
is 133.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:84%
134 will decay back into
133 relatively quickly.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.770 align:middle line:10%
But 137 has a half
life of about 30 years.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:45.110 align:middle line:10%
Which really pollutes
agricultural lands

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.580 align:middle line:10%
for centuries--

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:49.970 align:middle line:10%
200 to 300 years
really is considered

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:54.020 align:middle line:10%
how long it will contaminate
land, such as around Chernobyl

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.000 align:middle line:10%
and Fukushima.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.727 align:middle line:84%
So if an agriculture area is
contaminated with caesium,

00:39:00.727 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:90%
then the plant would take it up.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:90%
And if you eat the plant--

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.590 align:middle line:84%
remember, we already talked
about you are what you eat.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So the radioactive caesium
elements in the plant

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.830 align:middle line:84%
go into your body and get taken
up into your body's cells,

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:90%
as if they were potassium.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Which means you now have
radioactive caesium bound

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to the cell membrane of
every cell in your body.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.217 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere that the food goes.

00:39:24.217 --> 00:39:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Where does food go in your body?

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Everywhere that blood goes.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Where does blood go?

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere that you
have a living cell.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Everywhere.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Everywhere.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.920 align:middle line:84%
That's fascinating information
from the Health Ranger,

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Mike Adams, about the way
that our bodies intake

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:40.262 align:middle line:84%
radioactive isotopes, because
they mimic essential minerals.

00:39:40.262 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of mimicking,
did you know

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that there are substances
that mimic estrogens?

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.550 align:middle line:90%
They're called xenoestrogens.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
toxic is called BPA,

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's in almost every
bottle of water on the shelves.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The head of the FDA is on
the board the Schein company,

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.030 align:middle line:84%
the largest manufacturers
of silver fillings,

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:90%
which have 50% mercury in them.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Conflict of interest.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.480 align:middle line:10%
>> The head of the FDA, she
knows that Bisphenol A is one

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.270 align:middle line:10%
of the major causes--
she has the research--

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:14.810 align:middle line:10%
of cancer of the
breast and prostate.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Plastics are one of
the major causation

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.730 align:middle line:90%
of cancer in this nation.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:84%
She knows it, and
it's not banned.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Every single can that
you use has a lining.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Here's a can of water
that was given to me.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Guaranteed Bisphenol
A is lining every can.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.530 align:middle line:90%
It comes in plastic.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:38.390 align:middle line:90%
Harvard just did a study.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:45.890 align:middle line:84%
They gave a man a can
of minestrone soup.

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:48.705 align:middle line:84%
It happened to be a
brand-- it doesn't matter,

00:40:48.705 --> 00:40:49.580 align:middle line:90%
they're all the same.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's beer, whether
it's water, or minestrone.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:58.440 align:middle line:84%
They checked his body burden
of Bisphenol A. One week later,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
after eating the can of
Progresso minestrone,

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.020 align:middle line:90%
his BPA level went up 1,200%.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.870 align:middle line:90%
In one week it was still 1,200%.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Dentistry plays
an enormous role.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.220 align:middle line:84%
95% of females
with breast cancer

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.420 align:middle line:90%
have a dental involvement--

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Truman University study.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:28.220 align:middle line:84%
As much as 50% in the
remission of cancer

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:31.580 align:middle line:84%
can be in the oral cavity in
ordinary cancers, other cancers

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.030 align:middle line:90%
other than breast.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:90%
But in breast cancer it's 95%.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So every one of my clients are
sent to a biologic dentist.

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.780 align:middle line:90%
BPA, dental toxins.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.280 align:middle line:84%
That comment by Burton Goldberg
about the dental involvement

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.085 align:middle line:84%
with cancer really
got me to thinking.

00:41:48.085 --> 00:41:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I had to interview Bill
Henderson about this issue,

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.126 align:middle line:84%
as I knew that one of
the first things that he

00:41:52.126 --> 00:41:55.580 align:middle line:84%
has cancer patients do is to
clean out their dental toxins.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing that most people
don't even think about that

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:04.190 align:middle line:84%
I've found is so common
is dental toxins, OK?

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.010 align:middle line:10%
What's coming out of
our jaw for most people,

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.700 align:middle line:10%
from the dental work we've
had done, generally--

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.550 align:middle line:10%
root canals, cavitation
sites, as they're

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.850 align:middle line:10%
called, where you had wisdom
teeth or other teeth removed.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Mercury amalgam
fillings, the metal

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.010 align:middle line:84%
that the dentist
put in our mouth.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.010 align:middle line:84%
All of this stuff affects
our system dramatically,

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:29.270 align:middle line:84%
because our jaw is
intimately connected,

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and every tooth in our
mouth is intimately

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.480 align:middle line:84%
connected to organs in our
body through the old Chinese

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:39.330 align:middle line:90%
meridian system, if you will.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.980 align:middle line:84%
For example on each
side of the jaw,

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.730 align:middle line:84%
there are two molars,
upper and lower,

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:50.830 align:middle line:84%
that are directly connected to
the mammary glands in both men

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:51.630 align:middle line:90%
and women.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, men get
breast cancer, too.

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:57.890 align:middle line:84%
But these are probably the
most common cause of all breast

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.550 align:middle line:84%
cancers, simply because
they are directly

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:05.940 align:middle line:84%
connected to a gland that
brings on the breast cancer.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And when they are
dealt with, what

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I've found with really
thousands of my clients,

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:17.600 align:middle line:84%
once that type of
thing is cleared up,

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.040 align:middle line:90%
the cancer disappears.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It goes away.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And these are mostly
people, again,

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.940 align:middle line:84%
they're coming to me, Ty,
kind of as a last resort.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.870 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, they've been
through chemo and surgery

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and
it hasn't worked.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.130 align:middle line:90%
In the cancer has recurred.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And they start doing something
more sensible-- generally

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.010 align:middle line:90%
they do a diet change.

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:84%
They take supplements and what
have you that we recommend.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.050 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't seem
to work either.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:84%
In most cases, the
cancer is still there.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:49.200 align:middle line:90%
They feel better.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.310 align:middle line:90%
They get more energy.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.480 align:middle line:90%
They lose some weight.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:54.030 align:middle line:84%
But they don't get
over the cancer.

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.070 align:middle line:84%
They finally get
their jaw cleaned up

00:43:56.070 --> 00:44:00.180 align:middle line:84%
by some competent dentist,
and the cancer goes away.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Six or eight weeks
later, it's gone.

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:05.850 align:middle line:84%
This study, which was
completed in 1923,

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.630 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, after
60 prominent dentist

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:13.110 align:middle line:84%
tried to figure out how
to do a safe root canal.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And they threw up their hands,
and published this 1,174 pages

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.970 align:middle line:90%
of their study of root canals.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And found that they
could not be done safely.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And now almost 100
years later, they're

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:29.102 align:middle line:90%
still done the same way.

00:44:29.102 --> 00:44:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that the
definition of insanity?

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it is.

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed it is.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:90%
And why would it be done?

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:42.750 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you calculate the
income of the endodontist--

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.140 align:middle line:10%
this is a specialist
in root canals--

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.985 align:middle line:10%
it comes to several
billion dollars

00:44:47.985 --> 00:44:54.060 align:middle line:10%
a year, doing approximately 30
million root canals each year

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.670 align:middle line:10%
in the United States.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a very big
money making exercise.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or
not, the dentists

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.750 align:middle line:90%
are in denial about this.

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Their union, which is the
American Dental Association,

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:10.610 align:middle line:90%
is in denial about it.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.950 align:middle line:90%
As they are about mercury.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And so people listen to their
dentist down the street.

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about those root
canals, Alice, they're OK.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:27.310 align:middle line:84%
You must have some problem
originating somewhere else.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:32.820 align:middle line:84%
When in almost every case, 95%
of the time the primary cause

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.840 align:middle line:84%
of the cancer, in my experience,
is coming out of their jaw.

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Amazing information from
Bill Henderson about mercury

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.420 align:middle line:84%
amalgams in root canals, and all
these dental toxins that may be

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:43.860 align:middle line:90%
leading to cancer.

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But what if your drink, what
if your soda was giving you

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.120 align:middle line:90%
cancer?

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
heard of aspartame?

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get the opinion
of Dr. Daniel Nuzum.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And while I was in California,
I was able to sit down with him

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and to get his opinion
about aspartame,

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.960 align:middle line:84%
that's in most diet sodas,
and it's effect on our health.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Google aspartame, and look
up all the different names

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.510 align:middle line:10%
for aspartame.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.350 align:middle line:10%
It comes under quite
a few different names.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:12.250 align:middle line:10%
And not just an
artificial sweetener.

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:90%
It has other chemical names.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And in the labeling
process, they'll

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.640 align:middle line:90%
label it under different things.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't always
say aspartame.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:27.352 align:middle line:90%
But is it toxic to us?

00:46:27.352 --> 00:46:28.185 align:middle line:90%
>> It is very toxic.

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:90%


00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.752 align:middle line:84%
I always joke with my students
that it's a preservative,

00:46:33.752 --> 00:46:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because it breaks down
into formaldehyde.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what they preserve
dead bodies with.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not an antioxidant, though.

00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the chemical
makeup of aspartame?

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.280 align:middle line:84%
You said it breaks
down into formaldehyde.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> As aspartame is metabolized,
it ends up as formaldehyde.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And formaldehyde is a
toxic chemical itself.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.020 align:middle line:90%
It's cancer causing.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.499 align:middle line:90%
It's a corrosive chemical.

00:47:01.499 --> 00:47:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's embalming fluid, right?

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.373 align:middle line:84%
>> It's what's in
embalming-- exactly.

00:47:04.373 --> 00:47:06.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what's in
embalming fluid.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.230 align:middle line:84%
That's what they use to
preserve dead bodies.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:09.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:12.510 align:middle line:10%
It's the embalming fluid.

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:17.130 align:middle line:10%
Formaldehyde is number
one a neurotoxin.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was originally
designed as a neurotoxin

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.840 align:middle line:90%
in biological warfare weapons.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.920 align:middle line:90%
It was a nerve gas component.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.610 align:middle line:84%
So when we eat this,
we ingest aspartame,

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:35.160 align:middle line:84%
it converts into
formaldehyde and then

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:38.040 align:middle line:84%
starts to eat or corrode
our nervous system.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.810 align:middle line:10%
It's toxic to our
nervous system.

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:41.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:46.740 align:middle line:10%
So we're eating something that
is potentially a biological--

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Biological warfare agent.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, the symptoms of
neurotoxicity due to aspartame

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.910 align:middle line:84%
are identical to
the symptoms of MS--

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.860 align:middle line:90%
multiple sclerosis.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Identical.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.640 align:middle line:84%
It can give you the
exact same symptomology.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.680 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've had I can't tell
you how many patients

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that we've pulled
off of aspartame, off

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.970 align:middle line:84%
of all artificial
sweeteners of any kind.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And their diagnosis
for MS had disappeared.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I've read in the
literature about the initial

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:35.230 align:middle line:10%
days of aspartame in the late
'60s, early '70s, with GD

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:36.190 align:middle line:10%
Searle.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And apparently they found
that it was eating holes

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.150 align:middle line:90%
in the brains of the monkeys.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.510 align:middle line:90%
>> The monkeys, exactly.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a neurotoxin,
and it's corrosive.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:49.030 align:middle line:10%
It does.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:53.650 align:middle line:10%
In essence, what salt
does to a car body?

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:56.610 align:middle line:90%
It eats holes in it.

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> We were up in Detroit
recently, interviewing Dr.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.610 align:middle line:90%
David Brownstein.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:04.100 align:middle line:84%
We drove up next to a car,
and one of our camera guys--

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.000 align:middle line:90%
was it Travis?

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:05.900 align:middle line:90%
Was it you or Alan?

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It was Alan.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Alan said, look at that car.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And the whole-- it was
all just rotted out,

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.130 align:middle line:84%
because they salt
the roads up here.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So aspartame
does the same thing.

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Does the exact same thing.

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Does what salt would do
to the body of a car.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Only it does it to your
brain and your spinal cord.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:24.441 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you thirsty for
another diet soda now?

00:49:24.441 --> 00:49:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I bet you aren't, after
hearing that information

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.240 align:middle line:90%
from Dr. Nuzum.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.340 align:middle line:84%
But we hear a lot
of misinformation

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.140 align:middle line:90%
on the television.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you
listen, you probably

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.760 align:middle line:90%
think that sunlight is toxic.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:34.694 align:middle line:90%
But is it really?

00:49:34.694 --> 00:49:36.860 align:middle line:10%
>> If you don't have enough
vitamin D3 in your body,

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.230 align:middle line:10%
you're setting yourself up.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And almost all Americans
don't have enough.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Very minimum amounts.

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And how would you get that?

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you it through
the sunlight, of course.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't the sun bad?

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you listen
to modern medicine it is.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.360 align:middle line:90%
But it's totally a fraud, too.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.380 align:middle line:10%
You know what's bad is
the sunscreen you put on

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.499 align:middle line:10%
to keep yourself from
getting the UVB rays that

00:49:56.499 --> 00:49:58.040 align:middle line:10%
work with the
cholesterol in the skin

00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:02.060 align:middle line:10%
to form the vitamin D3 that
your body craves and needs

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:05.030 align:middle line:10%
for so many different
interactions in your body.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:07.970 align:middle line:10%
You know, the areas
that get skin cancer,

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.887 align:middle line:10%
you think they're where
they see the most sun?

00:50:09.887 --> 00:50:10.686 align:middle line:10%
They're not.

00:50:10.686 --> 00:50:13.070 align:middle line:10%
They're up where I live in
Seattle in the northern part

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:14.210 align:middle line:10%
of the hemisphere.

00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
get skin cancer

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:18.050 align:middle line:84%
on the bottom of
their feet and things

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.240 align:middle line:84%
like that that
never see the sun.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Sun doesn't cause cancer--

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.410 align:middle line:90%
the lack of D3 can.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:26.120 align:middle line:84%
The sunscreen you
put on your body

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.980 align:middle line:84%
can cause cancer, because
they're full of carcinogens.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.590 align:middle line:90%
So you need D3.

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
get it from the sun,

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:37.310 align:middle line:84%
we know you can get it from
a good cod liver oil now.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.070 align:middle line:84%
There's not very
many good ones left,

00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:41.390 align:middle line:84%
because they're taking
the A and D out of them

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and replacing them with
synthetics or not at all.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.880 align:middle line:84%
But there is one good one
left I talk about in my book

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Blue Ice Fermented Cod Liver
Oil from Green Pasture.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.380 align:middle line:10%
That is one of the last best
ones, and it's wonderful.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.500 align:middle line:10%
D3, iodine-- both imperative.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.420 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is short of iodine.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we eat bread today
that has bromine in it.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.140 align:middle line:84%
40 years ago we had
iodine in our bread,

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.220 align:middle line:90%
so we'd get it every day.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.120 align:middle line:90%
We have bromine now.

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:12.980 align:middle line:10%
And as you know, Ty, we have so
many thyroid issues and thyroid

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.490 align:middle line:10%
cancer today, and it's because
the bromine and the fluoride

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:19.130 align:middle line:10%
and the chlorine sit on the
iodine receptors in the thyroid

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:21.200 align:middle line:10%
and prevent the
uptake of iodine.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.570 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have iodide,
you're in trouble.

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.790 align:middle line:10%
You know Mike Adams
very well, and so you

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:29.870 align:middle line:10%
saw when he came out with
quoting the study that

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:32.840 align:middle line:10%
said 77% of all cancers
can be prevented

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.580 align:middle line:10%
if you have enough D3.

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.550 align:middle line:10%
But if you add iodine into
that, it's probably 80% or 85%

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:10%
of all cancers can be prevented
if you have enough iodine

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.060 align:middle line:10%
and D3.

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The sun actually
doesn't cause cancer.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the sunscreens
with the toxic chemicals

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.160 align:middle line:90%
that cause cancer.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a 2009
German study that

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:51.170 align:middle line:84%
showed that the sunlight
is three to five times

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:53.990 align:middle line:84%
better than any other substance
we know of at stimulating

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:55.376 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:51:55.376 --> 00:51:56.500 align:middle line:90%
But what about cell phones?

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:57.739 align:middle line:90%
What about EMF?

00:51:57.739 --> 00:51:59.280 align:middle line:84%
These are things
that are ubiquitous.

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.080 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.670 align:middle line:84%
EMF-- electromagnetic
frequencies.

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Cell phones,
everybody is carrying

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.060 align:middle line:90%
a cell phone and a handheld.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.029 align:middle line:84%
Is there any relationship
between these and cancer?

00:52:08.029 --> 00:52:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll tell you an experiment.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.370 align:middle line:84%
My daughter, who's 19
now, she was eighth grade.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And we did this
experiment in the office,

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:17.960 align:middle line:84%
because we had
thermography in our office.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.330 align:middle line:84%
So we took a picture
of someone's brain.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And they took a
picture of their head,

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.170 align:middle line:84%
rather, first before
cell phone use.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And then after one
minute of cell phone use.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:32.120 align:middle line:84%
After five minutes
of cell phone use.

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.560 align:middle line:90%
And after one hour.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And four hours later,
the brain was still

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.450 align:middle line:90%
inflamed after cell phone use.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:43.400 align:middle line:10%
So people do not understand
the power of the cell phone,

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.910 align:middle line:10%
and how much it
affects our body.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:45.710 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's a cumulative.

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And they actually have
published online rat

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:55.020 align:middle line:84%
brains exposed to cell
phone, and see what it does.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So like I mentioned
before, there's

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.330 align:middle line:84%
such thing as a
precautionary principle.

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:03.380 align:middle line:84%
If we have a little bit
of knowledge-- and we

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.120 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of knowledge now.

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
knowledge than we--

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:10.130 align:middle line:90%
you just don't hear about it.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Because the largest industry
lobbying in Washington

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.930 align:middle line:90%
is the electrical lobby.

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So they want all
these electronics.

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:23.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, yes, these electronics
allow us to tape this interview

00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:25.280 align:middle line:90%
and talk to each other.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And the computer, now we can
all communicate and socialize

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:29.360 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but now we have
to invent things

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to counteract all the wonderful
inventions we've made.

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> For people who don't think
that EMFs are a problem,

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:middle line:84%
I encourage them to go to the
BioinitiativeReport.org to take

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.310 align:middle line:90%
a look.

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.930 align:middle line:84%
27 scientists from
various countries

00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:54.800 align:middle line:84%
looked at 10 years of
data, and their conclusion

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.720 align:middle line:84%
was that EMFs cause
cancer, brain tumors,

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.150 align:middle line:84%
disrupt the immune
system, suppress

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the reproductive
functions of the body,

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:07.100 align:middle line:84%
affect your sleep
and your memory.

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.510 align:middle line:90%
So EMFs are a huge problem.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:13.040 align:middle line:10%
And it's been labeled one
of the most insidious toxins

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.370 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, because we
don't see it, we don't feel it,

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:19.760 align:middle line:10%
we don't taste it, but
it's affecting us 24/7.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:23.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, in this
office here, you

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:28.320 align:middle line:84%
can go to antennasearch.org
and find out how many antenna

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.220 align:middle line:90%
are within a four mile radius.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So I just googled and
put the address here--

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:38.100 align:middle line:84%
there are 91 cell towers and
144 antennas within a four mile

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.690 align:middle line:90%
radius of this location.

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you move closer to
big cities like Atlanta,

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:47.220 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at hundreds,
like 200, 300, 400 cell

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.480 align:middle line:90%
towers in just a few miles.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're literally
swimming in a soup

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.974 align:middle line:90%
of EMFs and electrical smog.

00:54:54.974 --> 00:54:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we say EMF, we're
talking about electromagnetic

00:54:57.390 --> 00:55:00.930 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that would
disrupt the body's normal flow

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.190 align:middle line:90%
of energy, correct?

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Because if EMFs can go
through brick walls,

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:09.750 align:middle line:84%
what do you think it's doing
when it goes through our body?

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:11.320 align:middle line:90%
It's causing damage.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.130 align:middle line:90%
And that damage is accumulative.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> What about EMF--
electromagnetic frequencies?

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.168 align:middle line:84%
Is there any kind of a
bearing, a relationship,

00:55:17.168 --> 00:55:18.470 align:middle line:90%
between EMF and cancer?

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:22.410 align:middle line:90%


00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.820 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, sometimes it's
just like when you do that,

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.440 align:middle line:10%
you ask me that question, it's
just like you don't even want

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.240 align:middle line:10%
to go there.

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's just like there's
this huge evil plot.

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:32.646 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if there's
anything that's

00:55:32.646 --> 00:55:34.410 align:middle line:10%
going to put people
over the edge,

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:38.670 align:middle line:10%
like just push them over the
cliff, you know that'll be it.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:39.970 align:middle line:10%
That will be the big one.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:43.140 align:middle line:10%
I mean, from walking around
with portable phones, right?

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.800 align:middle line:90%
To Wi-Fi in your house.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>> And all the handhelds.

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> All the handhelds.

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:50.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, having a clock by your bed.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.257 align:middle line:84%
You should have no plug-in of
anything where you're sleeping.

00:55:54.257 --> 00:55:55.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to tell you something.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:57.180 align:middle line:84%
You want to talk
about ADD, you want

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to talk about
migraine headaches?

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.690 align:middle line:84%
You know when I was
writing my book,

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Sick, Fat, Exhausted--
this is a true story.

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Had three computers
in the house,

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.100 align:middle line:84%
and I was, believe it
or not, I was on Wi-Fi.

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:08.940 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And even though I'm a
doctor, or even though I'm

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:13.810 align:middle line:90%
a health practitioner.

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:15.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how people do it.

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.935 align:middle line:84%
I'm a health practitioner,
and I know better,

00:56:16.935 --> 00:56:18.170 align:middle line:90%
but I don't know better.

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.585 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:56:18.585 --> 00:56:20.251 align:middle line:84%
>> You knew it but
you didn't act on it.

00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I get herded along, too.

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:24.210 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, this
is a true story.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.530 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
migraine headaches.

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And then I couldn't
get rid of them.

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.656 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to
get the book done,

00:56:29.656 --> 00:56:31.930 align:middle line:84%
but I was so
focused on the book.

00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:34.000 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't see the
forest for the trees.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.620 align:middle line:10%
So I would go three to five
days with migraine headaches.

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.480 align:middle line:10%
Soon as I turned the
Wi-Fi off in the place

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.690 align:middle line:10%
and I hard lined it, I haven't
had a migraine headache since.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Then I really wake up, and
then I'm going, oh my gosh.

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:49.374 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm working on this patient
and she's been losing her hair.

00:56:49.374 --> 00:56:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't realize, and
I said, it's your Wi-Fi.

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.040 align:middle line:84%
She said, I can't
turn my Wi-Fi off,

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.540 align:middle line:90%
my husband makes money that way.

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, you
better turn it off.

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.020 align:middle line:90%
So she goes, and guess what?

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:01.200 align:middle line:84%
She turned it off, and the
burning stopped on her scalp.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And then her kids went
and turned it back on,

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.780 align:middle line:90%
and her scalp started burning.

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.080 align:middle line:90%
She knew it was on right away.

00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.430 align:middle line:90%
So now her hair is growing back.

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:10.140 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just that.

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It affects everything.

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:15.166 align:middle line:10%
And if there's a weak link in
you, it's going to bust it.

00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:16.290 align:middle line:10%
And they already know this.

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:20.330 align:middle line:10%
That's why there's
whole towns, there's

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:26.390 align:middle line:10%
whole schools throughout
Europe that have banned Wi-Fi.

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:28.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let logic prevail.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.931 align:middle line:84%
You know, what we think
is easy is deadly.

00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:32.930 align:middle line:90%
You know, the microwave?

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:33.910 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Deadly.

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:35.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:35.834 align:middle line:10%
The Wi-Fi.

00:57:35.834 --> 00:57:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you
allow your children

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:42.140 align:middle line:84%
to lay in bed with their
iPads, with their iPhones,

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:43.460 align:middle line:90%
they're going to be so damaged.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.626 align:middle line:90%
>> A mutual friend of ours--

00:57:44.626 --> 00:57:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to mention
his name, because I'm not

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:47.902 align:middle line:90%
at liberty to discuss it.

00:57:47.902 --> 00:57:48.860 align:middle line:90%
But you know who it is.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Talked about Steve Jobs.

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.730 align:middle line:90%
He knew Steve Jobs.

00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Steve Jobs went for
treatment in Lichtenstein.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.910 align:middle line:10%
Was completely controlling
his cancer naturally.

00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:00.530 align:middle line:10%
Until several times
after he would go,

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:02.010 align:middle line:10%
and he would go into remission.

00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:04.120 align:middle line:10%
He came back to Apple.

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.170 align:middle line:10%
And what happened?

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:07.352 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, he was forced
to come back to Apple.

00:58:07.352 --> 00:58:09.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And what happened to his
cancer when he came back?

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.900 align:middle line:10%
>> It came back three times.

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:14.030 align:middle line:10%
Three times.

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:17.300 align:middle line:10%
When he came back into Apple,
because of all the EMF,

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:19.182 align:middle line:10%
his tumor came back.

00:58:19.182 --> 00:58:20.390 align:middle line:10%
And then he went for therapy.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:22.894 align:middle line:84%
And he did this
three times, until--

00:58:22.894 --> 00:58:24.560 align:middle line:84%
but you know, isn't
that kind of ironic?

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Three times and you're out.

00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And the mainstream
stories that we got

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.490 align:middle line:84%
was that Steve Jobs should
have gone conventional,

00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:33.948 align:middle line:84%
but instead he went alternative
and that's what killed him.

00:58:33.948 --> 00:58:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And the reality was he was
going natural in Liechtenstein,

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.810 align:middle line:90%
and it was curing him.

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And he came back, and the
EMFs potentially killed him.

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:44.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, that's one of those,
and the rest of the story is

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:44.750 align:middle line:10%
time.

00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:46.760 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.990 align:middle line:90%
GMO?

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.980 align:middle line:90%
EMF?

00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Fluoride?

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Aspartame?

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Vaccines?

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.370 align:middle line:90%
Pesticides?

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Which of these are
causing cancer?

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And how is all this
genetic manipulation

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.330 align:middle line:90%
affecting today's generation?

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to
Dr. Sherri Tenpenny

00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:02.510 align:middle line:90%
elaborate on this subject.

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:06.530 align:middle line:10%
>> We are, in my opinion, one
generation away of having very

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:12.200 align:middle line:10%
few humans left on the planet
who have non-contaminated DNA

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.990 align:middle line:10%
to propagate our species.

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:18.141 align:middle line:84%
So not just the
genetically modified foods

00:59:18.141 --> 00:59:19.390 align:middle line:90%
that are getting into our DNA.

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:22.920 align:middle line:84%
But the vaccines, because
of the fact of the albumin

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.150 align:middle line:90%
mounting this--

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Auto-immune response.

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think a lot of
people will say, well,

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.080 align:middle line:84%
how can you just say
it's the vaccines?

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Why isn't it genetically
modified food?

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Or fluoride?

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Or mercury from dental fillings?

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.190 align:middle line:90%
It's all of it.

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:41.100 align:middle line:84%
That's some amazing information
that we learned tonight.

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm really thrilled to
have been able to meet

00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:44.483 align:middle line:84%
some of these people,
some of these doctors,

00:59:44.483 --> 00:59:46.610 align:middle line:84%
some of these researchers
that we met tonight

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.097 align:middle line:84%
and we learned from some
amazing information.

00:59:49.097 --> 00:59:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Things that I think are
going to really help

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:54.260 align:middle line:84%
you understand about your immune
system and the things that

00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.250 align:middle line:90%
compromise that immune system.

00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, we learned of
course vaccines,

00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.750 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified
foods, the pesticides,

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:03.290 align:middle line:84%
herbicides, you've
got the aspartame,

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:05.315 align:middle line:84%
you've got dental toxins
that we learned about.

01:00:05.315 --> 01:00:07.190 align:middle line:84%
All of these different
things that compromise

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:08.606 align:middle line:84%
the immune system,
making you more

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:11.345 align:middle line:84%
susceptible to not only cancer,
but other diseases as well.

01:00:11.345 --> 01:00:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm really excited
about tomorrow night,

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.720 align:middle line:84%
because tomorrow night we're
going to learn about toxicities

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.847 align:middle line:90%
and how the detox.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:19.430 align:middle line:84%
We've learned about these things
that compromise immune system

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:20.630 align:middle line:90%
tonight.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:22.602 align:middle line:84%
Now, tomorrow night,
we're going to learn

01:00:22.602 --> 01:00:23.810 align:middle line:90%
about how to get rid of them.

01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:24.610 align:middle line:90%
How to detox.

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:26.660 align:middle line:90%
How to take out the garbage.

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.267 align:middle line:84%
It may be the most important
piece of the cancer puzzle.

01:00:29.267 --> 01:00:30.350 align:middle line:90%
So tune in tomorrow night.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:32.766 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn about
detoxification-- how to get rid

01:00:32.766 --> 01:00:36.244 align:middle line:84%
of heavy metals, pesticides,
all of these toxicities

01:00:36.244 --> 01:00:37.910 align:middle line:84%
that are compromising
your immune system

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:40.201 align:middle line:84%
and making you more
susceptible to disease.

01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for tuning in
tonight, and God bless you.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.056 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:00:46.056 --> 01:00:53.300 align:middle line:90%


01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:57.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Didn't want to talk to me,
referred me to the oncologist

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.600 align:middle line:10%
who recommended chemotherapy.

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.610 align:middle line:10%
And so my mother had one
chemotherapy treatment.

01:01:06.610 --> 01:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And she was in such tremendous
pain, discomfort, nausea.

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Violently vomiting
everything, even

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:18.240 align:middle line:90%
the anti-nausea medication.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Other than the suppositories
were the only way

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
that she could take the
medicine and not vomit.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And she told me, don't
let them do this anymore.

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:32.040 align:middle line:10%
I don't want any more of this.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.990 align:middle line:90%
I would rather be dead.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And through some
friends of our family,

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:42.720 align:middle line:84%
we learned about
Dr. E.T. Krebs, Jr.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.510 align:middle line:90%
We learned about apricot seeds.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:49.280 align:middle line:84%
We learned about laetrile,
also known as amygdalin.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And we learned about Dr.
Ernesto Contreras, Sr.

01:01:52.410 --> 01:01:54.750 align:middle line:90%
in Tijuana, Mexico.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:02:00.010 align:middle line:10%
I took my mother to see Dr.
Contreras in July of 1973.

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:01.540 align:middle line:10%
We were there for three weeks.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:05.010 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing I noticed,
after about 10 days pain levels

01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:06.030 align:middle line:10%
went down.

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:07.350 align:middle line:10%
Sense of well-being was up.

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:09.240 align:middle line:10%
Appetite was restored.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.150 align:middle line:10%
We came home, we continued
doing some of the things

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:14.610 align:middle line:10%
at home that we were able to do.

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Went down again for three
weeks end of August, September.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think the net result was
it was too little too late.

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But because I learned
that there were things

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that could be done that
the establishment had told

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.570 align:middle line:90%
us there was nothing else.

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:35.370 align:middle line:90%
There was no hope.

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:38.460 align:middle line:90%


01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I realized there had
to be a better answer.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I ended up marrying Dr.
Contreras' secretary, whom

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I had met while I was
there with my mother,

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and brought her back to Modesto.

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:56.790 align:middle line:10%
And through people that
she knew from her work

01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:01.110 align:middle line:10%
at the Contreras clinic,
and some people that I

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:05.400 align:middle line:10%
knew from a different venue--

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.180 align:middle line:10%
Ed Griffin, John Richardson.

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.150 align:middle line:10%
Said that there has
to be a better answer.

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's tragedy that this
information isn't available.

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
We had a year, two years,
three years before--

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
if we had received
the information,

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
even what we had at the end
of 1973, after my mother died,

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that we could
have certainly extended

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:37.252 align:middle line:84%
her life and the
quality of her life.

01:03:37.252 --> 01:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So I got involved with
The Cancer Control

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Society, Cancer
Victors and Friends,

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.670 align:middle line:90%
National Health Federation.

01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to-- if
there was anything

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I could do so that
people did not

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.900 align:middle line:84%
have to go through
what I went through,

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I was going to do everything
in my power to see that happen.

01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:56.810 align:middle line:10%
What the alternative
therapy did is

01:03:56.810 --> 01:04:01.520 align:middle line:10%
it gave my mother
and me an opportunity

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.800 align:middle line:10%
to come to grips
with the disease--

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.780 align:middle line:10%
the terminal nature of it.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And an opportunity
to say goodbye.

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Before learning about
alternative therapy,

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.400 align:middle line:84%
before going to
Mexico, I was told

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that she had anywhere from
30 to 60 days to live.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Not six months, not a year.

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:26.090 align:middle line:90%
30 days.

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
The oncologist said 30 days if
she would receive chemotherapy.

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:35.600 align:middle line:84%
60 days if she did
get chemotherapy.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.020 align:middle line:90%


01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And that was pretty rough.

01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And then what it did when we
did the alternative therapy,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
we had almost six months
of relative comfort.

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was the other thing--
it was the relative comfort

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:59.480 align:middle line:84%
during that time, where
we had an opportunity

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.950 align:middle line:90%
to talk about things.

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
My mother knew that I had
decided to get married.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.600 align:middle line:10%
She had met my
wife at the clinic,

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.060 align:middle line:10%
so she was
comfortable with that.

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.530 align:middle line:10%
She was resolved to the fact
that she wouldn't be there.

01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:18.800 align:middle line:10%
She wouldn't be able to
see her grandchildren.

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:25.640 align:middle line:10%
But at least we were able to
plan together and say goodbye.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
Without that, it
would have been--

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
it's always difficult to lose
a family member or a loved one,

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:37.460 align:middle line:84%
but at least I had
the positive memories.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.010 align:middle line:10%
Religious faith
sustained me, but it

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:41.810 align:middle line:10%
was the positive
memories that we

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:45.830 align:middle line:10%
had that last almost
six months that

01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:51.200 align:middle line:10%
allowed me to focus on
that, and form a mission

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.948 align:middle line:10%
to see that other people
didn't have to go through that.

01:05:55.948 --> 01:05:56.924 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

01:05:56.924 --> 01:05:58.388 align:middle line:90%
That's a real gift.

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.276 align:middle line:90%


01:06:01.276 --> 01:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you think your
mother would be

01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
happy to see what you
did with this situation?

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.699 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

01:06:07.699 --> 01:06:14.810 align:middle line:90%


01:06:14.810 --> 01:06:18.709 align:middle line:10%
And my wife is involved in this
movement, and our children--

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:19.625 align:middle line:10%
we have five children.

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%


01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.950 align:middle line:10%
They've all grown up
inside this movement.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
We have a granddaughter
that has the same--

01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:33.800 align:middle line:84%
kind of the same
face as my mother.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's a constant reminder.

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
But yes, we're a very
tight close knit family.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And so mother, grandparents
are very, very important.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
As a parent, grandparent,
I still remember--

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I know some people
think with silver hair,

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:59.970 align:middle line:84%
we've forgotten what
it is to being young.

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
We forgot what it is to
feel like a teenager.

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:07.350 align:middle line:90%
And no, I still remember.

01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:08.890 align:middle line:90%
I remember those.

01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:11.190 align:middle line:90%
And mostly with fond memories.

01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I do see things maybe a
little differently today,

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't
forgotten how it feels

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.980 align:middle line:90%
at various stages of life.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So I think that also
helps in this work, too.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
I've been through it.

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So I know what other
people are feeling,

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and I think that that allows
me to help them at least bring

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
their thought process
together so that then they

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
can choose an option that
will resonate with them.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And that will be effective
for them, certainly

01:07:47.490 --> 01:07:51.680 align:middle line:90%
at this moment in time.

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
besides cancer,

01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
based on everything I've learned
at these meetings over almost

01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
40 years, is don't believe
in mandatory vaccinations.

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Most of our children
were never vaccinated.

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Most of our grandchildren
have never been vaccinated.

01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And when our daughter-in-law
married our son,

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:17.050 align:middle line:90%
she wasn't sure.

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:20.140 align:middle line:84%
She thought that,
well, maybe the doctors

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.760 align:middle line:90%
knew what they were saying.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.890 align:middle line:90%
And our son told her, no.

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:25.689 align:middle line:84%
We're not vaccinating
our children.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:26.979 align:middle line:90%
She did research.

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
She adopted the same
position based on the things

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:31.689 align:middle line:90%
that she read.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And when she gets into a
Facebook, a social media

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:42.204 align:middle line:84%
discussion or debate with
some of her Facebook friends,

01:08:42.204 --> 01:08:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and they want to,
well, gee where are we

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:45.580 align:middle line:90%
going to get information?

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:50.658 align:middle line:84%
She puts, talk to
my father-in-law.

01:08:50.658 --> 01:08:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So she has seen
enough to know that--

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.689 align:middle line:84%
and again, that's inspiration
to keep the search, keep moving.

01:08:59.689 --> 01:09:01.310 align:middle line:90%
Because this is a mission.

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%
The Truth About Cancer is
a big part of the solution.

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it analyzes
the problem, it

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
analyzes the context
in which that problem

01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:14.630 align:middle line:90%
was allowed to occur.

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And it does offer solutions.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.380 align:middle line:90%
It is part of the solution.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:22.338 align:middle line:84%
Just like, think
outside the box is

01:09:22.338 --> 01:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
part of the solution
for overcoming cancer.

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:30.130 align:middle line:84%
So we're happy to participate
in this, because I know it's

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:31.660 align:middle line:90%
going to help a lot of people.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:35.310 align:middle line:90%
