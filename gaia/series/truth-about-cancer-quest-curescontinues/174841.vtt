00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to "The Quest
for the Cures Continues."

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:84%
In last night's episode,
we concluded with a story

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:84%
from Dr. Nicholas Gonzales
about Steve McQueen,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.447 align:middle line:84%
the star of "The Great Escape,"
who died of mesothelioma.

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of us had heard that he
died from some quack doctor

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
using a natural cancer
treatment, but in reality--

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Gonzales
shared this with us,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
he has the medical records
in his office now in New York

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:90%
City--

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Steve McQueen actually
died from the surgery,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.056 align:middle line:90%
not from the treatment.

00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
In tonight's
episode, we're going

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
to learn about more
suppressed information, more

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
disinformation, and
it's going to lead off

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:84%
with an interview with Dr.
Sunil Pai I was thrilled

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
to be able to meet Dr. Sunil Pai
the 1st of September in 2014.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We both spoke at a cancer
conference in Los Angeles.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
sit down with him

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and I learned about his
protocols for treating cancer.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.889 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's a conventionally
trained doctor.

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he's a medical
doctor conventionally trained,

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.080 align:middle line:84%
but he's decided
to integrate a lot

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.980 align:middle line:84%
of these natural, herbal
therapies, including cannabis,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:90%
into his protocols.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
You're going to learn a
lot from this episode.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So grab a chair, get a pen
and paper to take some notes,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy the show.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.159 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Early this year, I spoke at
the Cancer Control Society

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.171 align:middle line:90%
Convention in LA.

00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And while I was
there, I met up with

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
an amazing integrated medical
doctor named Sunil Pai.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:10%
>> As an integrated
physician, as an MD,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.310 align:middle line:10%
my job is to offer all the
opportunities and options.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And so unfortunately, many
people go conventional.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
It may be my personal option
that I wouldn't if I was them,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
but I still have to present
them with their options

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
depending on their
social economics,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:90%
if they have insurance or not.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, a
lot of people today

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:84%
are going to opt
for conventional

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.917 align:middle line:90%
because it's covered.

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a lot
of people say, oh, I

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
had to get my chemotherapy
because it was covered.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.856 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather go to
this clinic, say,

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:84%
here in Mexico or California,
but I can't afford it.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.849 align:middle line:84%
As an integrated
physician, what I look at

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.170 align:middle line:90%
is how to improve outcomes.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.217 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I present
all the data and I

00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:84%
looked at whether
you go conventional,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
whether you go alternative,
or for me as an integrated

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.666 align:middle line:84%
physician, we're trying to
look at the best of everything,

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I always look at how can we
always improve the outcome.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:84%
How do we take a toxic therapy
and make it more targeted

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.680 align:middle line:90%
and less side effects.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So you say toxic
therapy more targeted.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Like IPTLD?

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Even now, it's
like, for example,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
even though IPT has
a lot of benefits,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.984 align:middle line:84%
we're still giving chemo,
even on a low dose.

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And so now there's
certain clinics

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and certain people
are saying, well,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe that one tenth
is one tenth too much.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.070 align:middle line:90%
Is it better than 90%?

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.297 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:50.297 --> 00:02:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And now we have the studies,
which I showed today,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and further data we'll
have, but almost all the 13

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.356 align:middle line:84%
or 14 major chemotherapy agents
that is used in all cancers

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
with the animal studies
and the human studies

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:84%
will show that they
always do better

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.100 align:middle line:84%
with those other
products like curcumin.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.284 align:middle line:84%
So if people go for conventional
therapy or even doing IPT,

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
we still should be using
these other therapies

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.941 align:middle line:84%
to help, again,
lower the toxicity

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and then kind of
sensitize the tumor

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.065 align:middle line:90%
to those targeted effects.

00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I also use ginger and
also black pepper.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And so when we put those in
combination, ginger is also--

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.006 align:middle line:84%
now most people think of it
just for nausea or vomiting.

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the
ginger has also

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.880 align:middle line:84%
been shown to block NF-kB,
LOX enzymes, COX enzymes.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And it has a synergistic
effect with the curcumin

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:90%
and the Boswellia.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So in Ayurvedic medicine,
we have formulas.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.654 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when I was
conventionally trained,

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:41.820 align:middle line:84%
we were always thinking a
single magic bullet effect

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.234 align:middle line:84%
and we just gave one
product of high doses.

00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at
traditional cultures

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:84%
like Ayurvedic medicine
or Chinese medicine,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:90%
they have formulas.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:10%
And the reason is there's
a word called synergy.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:10%
That means that when we
use different ingredients,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:10%
they work together to have
a larger beneficial effect.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And also sometimes they can even
mitigate certain side effects

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:90%
even of each other.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>> The synergy.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> The synergy.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard because it's like
putting multiple drugs in one

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:84%
thing, but when we use
it as food or spices,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
we never just use
one spice in a meal,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:90%
we're putting multiple things.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth ingredient
is black pepper.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And we use something
called piperine.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:84%
Or BioPerine is the
patented form of that,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and that absorbs your
product 30% to 60% better.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So when we put
pepper on our food,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
it's not only an anti-cancer
block of kappa beta and LOX

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:84%
enzymes as well, it's
also an antioxidant

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and also helps bioavailable
enhance the digestion.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why a lot of times
I've seen people mix in black

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:84%
pepper with other ingredients
because it helps all of them

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
become more bioavailable
in your system.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.546 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally, in
every Ayurvedic formula,

00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:47.890 align:middle line:90%
we'd always put that in.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Black pepper.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But also every meal at
every restaurant you go--

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
tonight we'll go home and we're
going to have something there

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:90%
to crush some pepper.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.852 align:middle line:84%
It's to improve that
absorption to the body.

00:04:55.852 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always done it just
because I like the taste.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I love the taste.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess I was doing a good
thing and didn't know it.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> A good thing.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.375 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good thing.

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
One of the natural treatments
that Dr. Pai has researched

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.104 align:middle line:90%
is medicinal hemp or cannabis.

00:05:06.104 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:84%
He cleared up some
of the misconceptions

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:90%
about this plant.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of
misunderstanding and misuse

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.307 align:middle line:90%
of cannabis, right?

00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
think of marijuana.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Now with the
legalization and a lot

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
of things in the news of
different states turning over

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.935 align:middle line:84%
to have more open
legal use of marijuana.

00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my state,
for example, we

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
have medical
marijuana that can be

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
useful for patients that have
cancer or intractable pain.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It's still very difficult
for the patient to get that.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.294 align:middle line:84%
And the history goes with it,
the medical cannabis, or just

00:05:33.294 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
cannabis in general,
is that we've

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
been able to breed the
plant so it has higher THC.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
THC is the psychogenic
component-- the part

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.470 align:middle line:90%
that makes people high.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And CBD is a part of the
medical mar-- or marijuana.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not calling it
medical marijuana

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
because we use it
more medically now.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But CBD is a part
of the plant that

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.600 align:middle line:84%
has actually more of
the health benefits.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.844 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, since it
was an illegal drug, then

00:05:53.844 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:84%
as most things that are
illegal, the higher that you

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:90%
make the high--

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
or for example in alcohol,
say the beer is 8% alcohol,

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.552 align:middle line:84%
but if I sell Everclear,
it costs more.

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
You'll get drunk faster,
so they can charge you

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.426 align:middle line:90%
more for that, right?

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So same thing with
the marijuana.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.269 align:middle line:84%
The more that the person
got more stoned or high,

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:90%
the better they thought it was.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.018 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
a market of people

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:90%
who wanted to do it for that.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.343 align:middle line:84%
But the rest of the world
were looking at the CBD,

00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:18.175 align:middle line:90%
the cannabidiol components.

00:06:18.175 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's hundreds of these
families of these compounds

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:90%
called cannabidiols.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And THC, unfortunately,
got mixed up

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.730 align:middle line:84%
because it's coming from
the marijuana plant.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, interesting thing is
we can find it separately

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.162 align:middle line:90%
from the hemp plant.

00:06:31.162 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And industrial
hemp, unfortunately,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
got mixed up with
the marijuana plant,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
even though they're
from the same family.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
But legally, it got mixed up
because of political reasons

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:90%
and authorities.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We can talk about that
if you want to in a minute.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:84%
But the nice thing is that,
interestingly enough, when

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.029 align:middle line:84%
they grow the hemp
plant, it predominately

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:52.720 align:middle line:84%
has CBD only and traces of
THC, and therefore, people

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.170 align:middle line:84%
can't get high off of
taking the cannabidiols.

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
unhappy about that,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:84%
but we like it because
now we can use it

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:90%
to treat a variety of people.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Particularly patients
who have seizures.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.171 align:middle line:84%
Children with these
seizure syndromes

00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.560 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen many
documentary films recently.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Very helpful.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Cancer patients can use it,
or just as anti-inflammatory

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:90%
without the high effect.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Most of my patients want to
drive, they want to go to work,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.850 align:middle line:90%
they operate machinery.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:10%
They don't want to be laying
down sleeping or tired all day.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:10%
Or stoned, for that matter.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:10%
And so the nice thing
is we can get the CBD

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:10%
from that natural source.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And so they can get
the medicinal effect

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:90%
without the high.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.766 align:middle line:84%
We say get the healthy
without the high.

00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
CBD now is legal
in all 50 states,

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
as long as the source is coming
from a reputable benefactor

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.174 align:middle line:84%
that makes sure that there
is low amounts of THC

00:07:42.174 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:90%
so you can't get high.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, with the advent
of the internet,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:90%
now access is everywhere.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's certain states
that you can grow it.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
There's people that are selling
things on the internet, which,

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:84%
again, it's not
tested bash per batch,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.640 align:middle line:84%
so there is a variance
and a problem that

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.120 align:middle line:90%
will occur over time.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
But when we look at it through
reputable manufacturers

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
like the ones that
we use in our clinic,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:90%
then it's each batch is tested.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But now only for
the amount of CBD

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and how much THC so we can
make sure it's still legal,

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
but we also look for
heavy metals, pesticides,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.312 align:middle line:84%
contaminants like
molds and bacteria.

00:08:10.312 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
We've seen a lot of those
kind of contaminants coming

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.160 align:middle line:84%
in from industrial hemp oil
that comes from China, which is

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:90%
a large production right now.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:84%
Our sources, for example,
come from Europe.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, most of this will
be grown in the United States--

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
yea-- which is good because
it's a sustainable crop.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
We can then not only
use the CBD for health,

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
but we can use the hemp
for paper products,

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.479 align:middle line:90%
for clothing, for rope.

00:08:31.479 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Declaration of Independence.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Bibles were printed on it.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.994 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, there's
a lot of historical use

00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:90%
of hemp in this country.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.755 align:middle line:84%
It grows four times the
amount in one fourth

00:08:39.755 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:90%
of the space and use of water.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:84%
I showed that slide
on Kentucky is now

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
growing industrial hemp
instead of tobacco.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.881 align:middle line:84%
So it's putting the farmers,
keeping them working, but not

00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:84%
growing a crop that causes
cancer, but actually treats

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And the new thing
is cannabis hemp oil.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.626 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much
you've heard about that.

00:08:55.626 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But you basically take
marijuana and boil it

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
down to two ounces
of the essential oil.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Preferably with Everclear
or some kind of food grade

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.900 align:middle line:90%
solvent.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:90%
And boom.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:10%
You've got yourself not only
possibly the cancer cure,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.701 align:middle line:10%
but the Crohn's cure, the
AIDS cure, the diabetes cure.

00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I use the
word cure lightly

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:90%
because there is no such thing.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sure, you can cure it,
but there's no silver bullet.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
anybody too excited,

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.490 align:middle line:84%
because there is no silver
bullet from what I've seen.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis hemp oil would
definitely be in my arsenal

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:90%
for the CBD and the THC.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:84%
The THC, they're
both cannabinoids.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:84%
The THC will get you high, but
that is more for the cancer.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:41.034 align:middle line:84%
So for cancer patients,
I would recommend

00:09:41.034 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:90%
getting the higher TH.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But the CBDs are very, very
important too for healing.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that Dr.
Sanjay Galupte brought out

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:90%
that are curing--

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> On CNN.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> --the seizures on
the children, right?

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.357 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy that said, oh, no,
marijuana is bad, years ago.

00:09:56.357 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And now he's come
back and said, oops.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:90%
I was wrong.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Nice guy for doing that because
not a lot of them do that.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Admit they're wrong.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And so many children are being
saved because of that guy

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.565 align:middle line:90%
coming out with CNN.

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:08.200 align:middle line:90%
And god bless CNN, too.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you
guys are doing it.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:84%
How are you guys
telling the truth?

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So would you call hemp an
evil weed or a miracle plant?

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I call it god's gift.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I would have to
agree with Ian Jacklin.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Hemp is god's gift.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:84%
In this next clip,
Dr. James Forsythe,

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
who is a traditionally
trained oncologist,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
described some of the
treatments that they

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:84%
used at his clinic in Reno,
Nevada from vitamin C,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:84%
to hydrogen peroxide, to what
he calls it the FIP, Forsythe

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:90%
Immune Protocol.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So over the years and
since the early 2000s,

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:45.500 align:middle line:10%
I've done studies on pawpaw
from the pawpaw tree,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.660 align:middle line:10%
which that's a Nature's
Sunshine product,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:10%
and that causes cancer cells to
go into programmed cell death.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:10%
And then I did a study
for the Sanchez family

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:10%
on Poly-MVA, which is a complex
of lipoic acid and palladium.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:10%
And that also hyperenergized
the cancer cell

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:10%
and triggers through
the mitochondria

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:10%
the process of apoptosis.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.484 align:middle line:10%
So the cancer cells, which
don't know how to die

00:11:13.484 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:10%
and they didn't
have enough energy

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.040 align:middle line:10%
to go into a death spiral,
they basically now can die off,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.750 align:middle line:10%
and so that was effective.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:10%
Then I did the Forsythe
Immune Protocol, FIP,

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.780 align:middle line:10%
which is a number of agents.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:34.100 align:middle line:10%
And started to use some genomic
testing, then, and some IPT.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:10%
And that program
lasted about five years

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:10%
and it got about a 45% survival
rate, which was 22% higher

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.436 align:middle line:10%
than the conventional guys.

00:11:45.436 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:10%
Not 22%, but 22 times
higher, I should say.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:49.820 align:middle line:10%
>> 22 times higher.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.830 align:middle line:10%
>> And then the last study
I've engaged in started in June

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:10%
of 2010 and it's
now 15 months old.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:10%
That's when my paper
was presented here

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:10%
at the conference was
15 months, 650 patients

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:10%
showing a 67% higher, which
was now making the survival

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.157 align:middle line:10%
rate 33 times higher.

00:12:11.157 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And what does that protocol
that you've been testing?

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> That protocol basically
is one in which we do genomic

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
testing, gene testing
on every patient.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:10%
We send their blood off, we look
for circulating tumor cells.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And thanks to the
Human Genome Project,

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.020 align:middle line:84%
we're able to tell
the patient what

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:84%
that result what drugs, what
hormones, and what supplements

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:90%
work best.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:10%
So now if, god forbid,
you had a prostate cancer,

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:10%
you came to me with
stage four disease,

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:10%
I'd be able to give
you a report showing

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:10%
what are the best
hormones for you, what

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.770 align:middle line:10%
are the best supplements,
and what are the best drugs.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.240 align:middle line:10%
And that's unique to
you and your genes.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:10%
It's not for every patient with
prostate cancer or something,

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:10%
because your genes are only
yours and no one else's.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:10%
You're going to respond
differently to different drugs.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:10%
Before, on the other side of the
fence, it was a guessing game.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.150 align:middle line:10%
I would be guessing
what would help you.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.211 align:middle line:10%
And as I tell all my
patients, if I guess wrong,

00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm giving you a poison.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm hurting you.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:10%
And it's as simple as that.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to do that anymore.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that would be
violating the Hippocratic Oath.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> You would be
harming patients.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So basically, by getting a
blueprint, I'm right on track.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
That's why our survival
rate is better than most.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:84%
We compared ourselves with the
NCI, National Cancer Institute,

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and Cancer Treatment
Centers of America.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Same for in breast cancer.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Their survival rate
after two years

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
stage four disease was 43%,
Cancer Treatment Centers

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:90%
was 64%, and ours was 85%.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, we beat
them both significantly.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you said one of
the treatments I guess

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:84%
you've studied or you've
been using is the FIP.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.577 align:middle line:90%
The Immune Protocol

00:14:01.577 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Forsythe Immune--

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>> The Forsythe Immune Protocol.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
that a little bit?

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's like what
we call a Myers' Cocktail.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:10%
It's an immune stimulant.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.170 align:middle line:10%
It has DMSO in it.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:10%
It has selenium.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.150 align:middle line:10%
It has important immune
stimulants, vitamins, minerals,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:10%
amino acids.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:10%
And that's one of
the immune therapies.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:10%
We use high dose C. We go
from 50 to 75 grams of C twice

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:10%
a week.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Intravenous?

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Intravenous.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.235 align:middle line:90%
You can't give that much orally.

00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought that'd probably
cause some severe intestinal

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:10%
You're not going to
handle that very well.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:10%
Hydrogen peroxide, which
is a bio-oxidative therapy.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:10%
That's given intravenously.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:10%
And then Poly-MVA, which is the
lipoic acid palladium complex,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:10%
which is very effective.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the L-glutathione
amino acid IV.

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.535 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
happens, Ty, is

00:14:59.535 --> 00:15:01.700 align:middle line:84%
they're getting immune
therapies three days a week.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.783 align:middle line:90%
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

00:15:02.783 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:90%
They're getting IPT.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.760 align:middle line:10%
And I've modified
the IPT program

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:10%
from what was originally started
40 years ago in South America

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:10%
by putting the insulin right
in with the chemo right

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:10%
from the start.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:19.710 align:middle line:10%
So you get less
severe reactions.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.564 align:middle line:10%
So you're not going to get the
severe hypoglycemic reactions.

00:15:23.564 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:10%
>> And you're using the IPT.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.110 align:middle line:10%
It's low dose chemo--

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:10%
>> 10% dose.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:10%
10% to 15% max.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.452 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have very, very little
side effects with that, right?

00:15:32.452 --> 00:15:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Our patients don't lose
hair, they don't get sick,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
they don't have rashes,
don't get organ toxicity,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.916 align:middle line:84%
chemo brain, none
of that happens.

00:15:39.916 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the
treatments that Dr.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Forsythe just
mentioned is IPTLD--

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:84%
insulin potentiated targeted
low dose chemotherapy.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:84%
In this next clip, Dr.
Murray "Buzz" Susser

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:84%
sheds some more light
on this treatment.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>> IPT is a good option.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.220 align:middle line:10%
I've seen people who
had exhausted everything

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.400 align:middle line:10%
in conventional medicine, and
conventional chemotherapy,

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:10%
conventional everything,
and they always

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:10%
give that little phrase, go home
and get your things in order.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.550 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, that's
a real doctory thing.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.022 align:middle line:10%
>> And with the IPT,
a lot of these people,

00:16:17.022 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:10%
instead of getting
their things in order,

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:10%
took IPT and got a lot of good
results and a good quality

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:10%
of life.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:84%
IPT is insulin
potentiation therapy.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.855 align:middle line:84%
Now they're calling it
low dose chemotherapy.

00:16:31.855 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>> IPTLD.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Can you kind of
describe what is IPTLD?

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:90%
What is the low dose IPT?

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the low dose
IPT, the low dose therapy,

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:10%
has to do with fooling
the cancer cells.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells eat sugar at
about 19 times the speed

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.040 align:middle line:90%
of healthy cells.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And cancer cells
have races for sugar.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Which, you should say, that's
one of the good management

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
aspects of treating
cancer patients

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:84%
is take them off
every drop of sugar.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Not a speck.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:84%
But with IPT, what you
do is you give insulin,

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and insulin lowers
the blood sugar.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.183 align:middle line:84%
And you adjust to get the
right amount of insulin,

00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:24.099 align:middle line:84%
and you give it, and you
lower the blood sugar

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
below its normal rate of about
90 or 100 milligrams per set.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And when it gets down to 40
range, you get really sick.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you feel sick.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not dangerous,
but it feels terrible.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It gets danger when you get
down around 20, or 10, or zero.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.135 align:middle line:84%
But at 40, it's not dangerous,
but it's quite unpleasant.

00:17:45.135 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:10%
And what's happened, it's
unpleasant for the cancer

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:10%
cells.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:10%
It's more because
they're starving.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And cancer cells are really good
at selecting out chemotherapy.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:84%
They won't take chemotherapy,
but they will take sugar.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you take
away all the sugar,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:84%
then the cancer cells
will take anything.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:10%
That's kind of
like someone dying

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.977 align:middle line:10%
of thirst on the
ocean in an ocean raft

00:18:06.977 --> 00:18:08.060 align:middle line:10%
and they drink salt water.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Drink salt water.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>> They know it's not good
for them and it kills them.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But the cancer cells then will
take the chemotherapy instead

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:90%
because they can't get sugar.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And that gives a tremendous
benefit therapeutically.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And the numbers are
really fantastic on that

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:84%
because the IPT gives
you 200% or 300% therapy

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:90%
with 10% of the toxicity.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> You give a tiny dose of
chemotherapy at the therapeutic

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
moment when the blood
sugar reaches 40.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:90%
You give the IV chemotherapy.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.134 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that's more of a
selectively toxic treatment

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.550 align:middle line:84%
towards the cancer cells than
just blasting the whole body

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:90%
with chemo.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
the way to put it.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So then you can
use a smaller dose.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
You can lessen the side effects
because you're using, what?

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:84%
You said 1/10 of a
dose of normal chemo

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:90%
and get better results.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> 10% of the dose.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:10%
>> And these are people, many
of them, most of them perhaps,

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.784 align:middle line:10%
have already failed at all
the conventional methods,

00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:10%
and so there's nothing left.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:84%
But the conventional
methods are growing now

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
people wind up getting

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.470 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper radiation,
so it's really frying them.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And they need larger and
larger doses of chemo,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.550 align:middle line:90%
so that's frying them.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:10%
And the surgery
becomes imponderable

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:10%
because the tumor invades
things that you can't cut out.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I've heard, I can't
remember who it was,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:10%
said that IPTLD turns chemo,
it changes came from a shotgun

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:10%
into a rifle.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> A sniper rifle.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sniper rifle.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.370 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I watch the military channel.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:10%
So we've got a sniper rifle
chemotherapy treatment

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.120 align:middle line:10%
with IPTLD.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:01.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:10%
And I used to fire missiles and
rockets from fighter planes.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Did you?

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:10%
>> That was just my
Disneyland stuff.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:10%
>> That was pre-med school days.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Pre-med school.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.460 align:middle line:10%
I was a trained killer.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Were you?

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:10%
And now you're a trained healer.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:10%
>> You're on the other
side of the coin.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd rather do
healing than killing.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm one of I think four
doctors now that is qualified

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:84%
to teach insulin
potentiated chemotherapy--

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:90%
IPT.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:10%
And that is a fabulous
way to do chemotherapy.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:10%
So fabulous that I just think
it's illogical for anyone who's

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:10%
going to get chemotherapy,
if they want to do chemo,

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:10%
they should do IPT.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.736 align:middle line:90%
A couple of quick reasons.

00:20:46.736 --> 00:20:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And this might be included in
other people discussing it,

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
but you have to know that
when you give insulin,

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
it shifts the cancer
cells to what's

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
called the S phase, or
the synthesis phase,

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
or the active phase, and
that's the only phase that

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:90%
chemotherapy can be effective.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So you have really four phases
that the cancer cell can be,

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:84%
so you've got a 25% chance
that if you give chemo,

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:84%
it's going to kill
the cancer cell.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you give
insulin beforehand,

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.745 align:middle line:84%
it pushes them at
about 70% S phase.

00:21:16.745 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got almost
a three out of four chance

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:19.840 align:middle line:90%
to kill cancer cells.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're
going to give chemo,

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:90%
let's kill the cancer cells.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Just giving a little
insulin pushes

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.689 align:middle line:84%
the cells into the
vulnerable phase.

00:21:27.689 --> 00:21:29.730 align:middle line:84%
The second thing I like
about insulin potentiated

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
chemotherapy is that when
you give the insulin,

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.610 align:middle line:84%
it makes the cell
membrane not only more

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:84%
permeable to
chemotherapy selectively

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:84%
compared to your
other healthy cells,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.910 align:middle line:84%
but it also inhibits
the cancer cell

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
from kicking out
toxic chemotherapy.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So then really what we're
looking at is sort of like

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.107 align:middle line:84%
insulin potentiation low dose
chemo is a treatment that

00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I've become familiar with.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.356 align:middle line:84%
People have mentioned this
in this interview series,

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
this docuseries that
we're doing that they

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:84%
use the insulin as a potentiator
to kind of trick the cancer

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
cells into opening up, and
then the chemo kills them.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>> So the same basic principle.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm glad you brought that
up because when I first got

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:10%
started into cancer research,
there was a clinic down

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:10%
in the southeast--

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.469 align:middle line:10%
I can't remember which
exactly which state it was in.

00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of the cancer
patients I was working with

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:90%
was going to that clinic.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It used DMSO and low
dose chemotherapy.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I called it DMSO
potentiation therapy.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't really have a name.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:90%
That's just my name.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But DMSO and MSM are
not glucose products,

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.210 align:middle line:84%
but they have a propensity
to target cancer

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
cells by themselves
and they open the ports

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:90%
to the cancer cells.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.285 align:middle line:84%
And so DMSO and
low chemotherapy--

00:22:42.285 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are four
different types of chemotherapy

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:90%
that actually bind to DMSO.

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And so DMSO and low
dose chemotherapy,

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:84%
the right kind of low
dose chemotherapy,

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.750 align:middle line:84%
was being used in one of
the clinics down there.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I never got around
to contacting them

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.740 align:middle line:84%
because they were
shut down by the FDA.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But that would be even better
than insulin potentiation

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.020 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Fascinating information from
Webster Kehr, The Cancer Tutor,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
about using substances
such as DMSO to bind

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.000 align:middle line:84%
to the chemotherapy so that
much smaller doses can be used.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:84%
By the way, Webster Kehr
was one of the first ones

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that I began to learn from
as I began to research cancer

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.542 align:middle line:90%
treatments over 15 years ago.

00:23:25.542 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Listen to Webster
in this next clip

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.700 align:middle line:84%
as he describes the Royal
Raymond Rife treatment using

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.230 align:middle line:90%
frequency generators.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 1930s, Royal
Rife, Dr. Royal Rife,

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
who was a microbiologist, knew
that there were microbes inside

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.816 align:middle line:90%
the cancer cells.

00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:10%
And he came up with
an electro medicine

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:10%
device, a couple
of them actually,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.680 align:middle line:10%
which was designed to do
nothing but kill the microbes

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.180 align:middle line:10%
inside the cancer cells.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:84%
When he did that, of
course, the cancer cells

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.740 align:middle line:90%
reverted into normal cells.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of his
major contributions,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.450 align:middle line:84%
aside from finding
the right frequencies,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:84%
was that he also determined
that you needed a carrier

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
wave to get the cancer, the
microbe killing, the cancer

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
microbe killing frequency
all the way through the body

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
so it would kill all the
microbes in the cancer cells.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Would not harm natural
cells because natural cells,

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.560 align:middle line:84%
healthy cells don't have
these microbes in them.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It would only
affect the microbes

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
in the bloodstream,
which are good to kill.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.650 align:middle line:84%
There's very few
microbes that are good.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.441 align:middle line:84%
There are a few that
are good, but it's not

00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:31.717 align:middle line:90%
going to bother them.

00:24:31.717 --> 00:24:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Even if you kill
them, it's not really

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:90%
going to have a lot of effect.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.370 align:middle line:90%
So he developed this technology.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:84%
The American Medical
Association tried to buy him out

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and he refused because
he did not trust them.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Good for him.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.791 align:middle line:84%
And so the Food and
Drug Administration

00:24:47.791 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
went down and destroyed his
laboratory, his equipment,

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed all
of his inventory.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.900 align:middle line:10%
>> What other treatments
would you recommend for cancer

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:10%
patients that may be a nontoxic
treatment that don't create

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.900 align:middle line:10%
cancer, that don't cause cancer,
but that would be able to get

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:10%
cancer under control that
wouldn't have the direct

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:10%
effects that the chemo might?

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, I'm actually
currently working on the most

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:10%
phenomenal herbal nutritional
natural agent that I've seen

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.710 align:middle line:10%
to date.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:10%
It's beyond my belief system
right now that it is that good,

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:10%
but I'm under strict
confidentiality

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.260 align:middle line:10%
that I can't share that.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.020 align:middle line:84%
But there are good herbals
and nutritionals out there.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Salvestrol is a
great nutritional

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:90%
that anyone can get.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.370 align:middle line:90%
You can mail order.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Go online and get it.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:84%
You have to take it with
biotin to help it work.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Artemisinin-- it's the
number one anti-malaria

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.830 align:middle line:90%
drug in the world.

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Great anti-parasitic, but it's
a good anti-cancer, natural

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:90%
anti-cancer agent.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.770 align:middle line:90%
You have to take it with iron.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:10%
So you have to know
the nuances of a lot

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.920 align:middle line:10%
of these natural agents
to get them to work.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.864 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, you
want a coach, someone

00:26:05.864 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:10%
knowledgeable in understanding
because, like, artemisinin,

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:10%
you can't take resveratol
with it because--

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.370 align:middle line:10%
actually, that's salvestrol
because it neutralizes it.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:10%
So you don't want to just, oh,
this is good, this is good,

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.582 align:middle line:10%
this is good, and do the--

00:26:18.582 --> 00:26:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>> You don't want to throw
Jell-O at the wall and see

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:10%
if it sticks.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.399 align:middle line:10%
>> There you go.

00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to
stir it in the pot.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:10%
You want someone who knows
how these things go together.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.860 align:middle line:84%
What's working here,
what's working here,

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.980 align:middle line:90%
what's working here so that--

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.310 align:middle line:90%
I am a orchestra director.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:40.710 align:middle line:84%
I tell the oboes when to play,
and the flutes, and the drums.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:44.250 align:middle line:10%
And that's my job, is to
orchestrate a patient's

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:10%
treatment back to health.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
have, is knowledge.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And knowledge is
very empowering.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So you know what fits together,
you know when to give what,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and where, and how
these things work

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.645 align:middle line:84%
together so that the patient
becomes healthy again.

00:27:03.645 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You talked about this herbal
product that you can't mention.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But what are the
characteristics,

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
the methods of action of
a good herbal product,

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.510 align:middle line:90%
a good natural product?

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:17.070 align:middle line:84%
How do they control the
cancer, and what kind of effect

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.340 align:middle line:84%
they have on the immune system,
the detoxification process?

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Share with us the typical
methods of action.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> There are so many good,
non-toxic ways to treat cancer

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that it's laughable what
standard medicine is doing.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But they all work
in different ways.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.250 align:middle line:84%
For instance, salvestrol
works on an enzyme system.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:10%
CYP1B1 is the enzyme
system that it works on.

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:51.090 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is a natural product
found in fruits and vegetables

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:55.540 align:middle line:10%
that CYP1B1 enzyme converts
into a toxic product.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:10%
So this fruit extract, vegetable
extract acts as a pro-drug.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:10%
It's not a drug.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.360 align:middle line:10%
Your normal cells don't
have that enzyme system,

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:10%
so it can't convert it.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:10%
So it doesn't hurt normal cells.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.800 align:middle line:10%
But the cancer cells
have the CYP1B1,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.500 align:middle line:10%
so it converts it into
a toxic substance,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.490 align:middle line:10%
killing the cancer cells.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:10%
So that's just an
instance of how

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:25.690 align:middle line:10%
a particular natural
therapy might work.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:34.430 align:middle line:10%
And why don't we have
salvestrol today in our body?

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, natural fruits
and vegetables

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:84%
produce it just in the
last day or two right

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.460 align:middle line:84%
as they become
ripe because that's

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
when they're higher
in sugars, and that's

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:84%
when fungi tend to attack
the fruits and vegetables.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's when they
make salvestrol.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.334 align:middle line:84%
Who eats vine
ripened fruit today?

00:28:55.334 --> 00:28:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Unless you have your
own garden, you don't.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Nobody, because it's
all picked green.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you're
eating it in a natural food

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.620 align:middle line:90%
store or an organic food store.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:08.344 align:middle line:84%
It was still picked green to
ship to you because that's

00:29:08.344 --> 00:29:10.510 align:middle line:84%
the only way that they can
get it there and not lose

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:13.090 align:middle line:90%
half their produce to spoilage.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So we are eating all this food
that's salvestrol depleted,

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.710 align:middle line:84%
one of the very agents
that mother nature uses

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:90%
to kill cancer cells.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Which ma and pa got
back on the farm,

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.362 align:middle line:84%
but in the city buying it from
the store, we don't get it.

00:29:28.362 --> 00:29:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Johnson just described
two of the treatments that he

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.920 align:middle line:84%
uses, salvestrol
and artemisinin.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.590 align:middle line:84%
In this next clip let's
listen to Bob Wright talk

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
about Protandim, a
supplement that he

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.874 align:middle line:90%
uses, and also organic sulfur.

00:29:39.874 --> 00:29:41.290 align:middle line:10%
>> When you think
about Protandim,

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:10%
it's a concoction of five
different, basically, herbs.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:10%
You've got herbs and
plants, green tea leaf,

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:10%
you've got turmeric, and you've
got several other things that

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:10%
are actually very
efficacious against cancer

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:10%
and they're extreme
antioxidants all by themselves.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But you put them
together and they

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.680 align:middle line:84%
appear to form some
kind of a synergism.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And synergism is kind of
an overused word nowadays,

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's used to say that
when you put things together,

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:90%
they work better.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Like a plant.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.880 align:middle line:10%
We'd be better off to
eat the virgin plants

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.207 align:middle line:10%
and organic plants than
any type of supplements,

00:30:21.207 --> 00:30:22.540 align:middle line:10%
but we can't eat enough of them.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.760 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you can't sit down and
eat six pounds of broccoli,

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:10%
and six pounds of cauliflower,
and six pounds of spinach,

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.070 align:middle line:10%
and on and on every day,
especially if you have cancer.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:10%
But you need that
kind of nutrition.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.105 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a synergism
in the Protandim.

00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Especially for people who've
undergone chemotherapy

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.964 align:middle line:84%
because it's just
tremendous antioxidant.

00:30:40.964 --> 00:30:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And someone who's undergone
chemo or radiation

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:90%
become oxidized.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:84%
They start to rust internally
and acidify internally.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:90%
Inflamed.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And the Protandim helps
that dramatically.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very anti-cancer
product in itself.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.895 align:middle line:84%
We've actually heard reports,
and I've written about a few

00:30:56.895 --> 00:30:58.936 align:middle line:84%
of them in my newsletters
and I think in the book

00:30:58.936 --> 00:31:02.830 align:middle line:84%
as well, about people who only
use Protandim for their cancer,

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.580 align:middle line:90%
and they've had great results.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:10%
MSM, it's really
an amazing thing

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.160 align:middle line:10%
when you think it's
truly organic sulfur.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.240 align:middle line:10%
And when you think of
sulfur in the body--

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:10%
most people don't
know this, but we

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.790 align:middle line:10%
talk about the body being 70%,
75% water and all of that,

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:10%
but people don't know that
by weight volume in the body,

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:10%
sulfur is 25% of
the body by weight.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.925 align:middle line:10%
It's in your bones, it's in
your muscles, it's everywhere.

00:31:30.925 --> 00:31:33.100 align:middle line:10%
And people simply don't
have enough of it,

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:10%
nor the right kind of it.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.120 align:middle line:10%
So we highly recommend this.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:42.160 align:middle line:10%
And actually, we see
MSM and organic sulfur

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:10%
as being an integral part of
the cancer healing process.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.050 align:middle line:10%
And I won't go deep into
that because it goes back

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:10%
to this new plant extract that
we're developing that's based

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:10%
on a sulfur medium as well.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:10%
And it's not time for
that yet, but it's

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.530 align:middle line:10%
a very interesting thing that
we'll talk about in the future.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:05.020 align:middle line:10%
But sulfur is
incredibly important.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.120 align:middle line:10%
And I'm working with a
guy right here that I'm

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:10%
going to see here tomorrow.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:13.780 align:middle line:10%
He is a former big time
celebrity and still is.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:10%
He's still performing
at 80 years old.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.650 align:middle line:10%
I won't mention his
name today, but you'll

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.858 align:middle line:10%
be able to meet him tomorrow.

00:32:18.858 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:10%
He has prostate cancer.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.110 align:middle line:10%
Got him the MSM because he
had a lot of pain, pain gone.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Really?

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Pain gone.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.470 align:middle line:10%
And no one can guarantee
that, but we see that.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:32.560 align:middle line:10%
And we see that it's an
effective and essential

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.960 align:middle line:10%
nutrient within the body.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.800 align:middle line:90%
I recommend it highly.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.835 align:middle line:90%


00:32:39.835 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Bill Henderson, who sits on our
advisory board, one of the best

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
cancer coaches in
the United States,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.500 align:middle line:84%
he's affected radical
change in cancer patients

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and helped them--
thousands and thousands.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.670 align:middle line:10%
Maybe tens of thousands now.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.590 align:middle line:84%
He does the Budwig
Protocol, which

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
is a good protocol for
oxygenation of the cells

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.050 align:middle line:90%
to kill the cancer.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Johanna Budwig
proved that, you know,

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.710 align:middle line:90%
how many years ago?

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:84%
She was effecting that change
in end stage cancer patients.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:90%
90% of them were getting well.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.160 align:middle line:10%
There's no drug
that can do that.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Nothing that can do that.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got the silver
rich proteins in that Budwig

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Protocol.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.780 align:middle line:84%
That normally comes out
of organic cottage cheese

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:90%
or organic kefir.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.080 align:middle line:90%
That's the sulfurated proteins.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.010 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:10%
And it's combined with the
omega 3s and the flax oil that

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:10%
make that change,
that reaction that

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.780 align:middle line:10%
takes place that allows it to
enter the cell and oxygenate.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.249 align:middle line:84%
But the sulfur,
spot on with that.

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Dr. Budwig discovered
that when she combined flaxseed

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.180 align:middle line:84%
oil with its powerful healing
nature of essential electron

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.360 align:middle line:84%
rich unsaturated fats
and cottage cheese,

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.930 align:middle line:84%
which is rich in sulfur protein,
the chemical reaction produced

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.870 align:middle line:84%
makes the oil water soluble and
easily absorbed into the cell

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:90%
membrane.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.407 align:middle line:90%
She was a brilliant doctor.

00:33:56.407 --> 00:33:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of brilliant
doctors, earlier this year I

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.050 align:middle line:84%
was privileged to
meet and interview

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.690 align:middle line:90%
a doctor named Daniel Nuzum.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Nuzum has seven doctorates.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.590 align:middle line:84%
He teaches at four
different medical schools.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.319 align:middle line:84%
He's a toxicologist
and also an osteopath.

00:34:09.319 --> 00:34:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Some of this information
that he's about to share

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:90%
is going to blow your socks off.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:17.989 align:middle line:84%
>> Florine and chlorine are
a group of-- on the periodic

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.940 align:middle line:84%
table, they're a
group of halogens.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:10%
Chemicals called halogens.

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:27.595 align:middle line:10%
Iodine is your largest halogen.
It's the most important.

00:34:27.595 --> 00:34:29.704 align:middle line:90%
Iodine's an essential element.

00:34:29.704 --> 00:34:32.900 align:middle line:84%
If you're iodine deficient,
you'll have thyroid problems.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.340 align:middle line:84%
If you're iodine
deficient, you'll

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.840 align:middle line:84%
have blood sugar
metabolization problems.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that you cannot
become type 2 diabetic unless

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.860 align:middle line:90%
you're iodine deficient.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.800 align:middle line:90%
So there's a whole vast--

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.010 align:middle line:84%
iodine keeps your kidneys
from being infected.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.940 align:middle line:84%
It keeps your liver
from being infected.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a disinfectant.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Iodine is an absolutely
essential nutrient.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's the largest
of the halogens.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:11.390 align:middle line:10%
So the iodine receptor site is
a big receptor site on the cell.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:14.720 align:middle line:10%
If something else gets into
that receptor site, which

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.490 align:middle line:10%
we have bromine, fluorine,
and chlorine, or fluoride

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.820 align:middle line:10%
and chloride.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.560 align:middle line:10%
Those are smaller halogens.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.800 align:middle line:10%
Those molecules are smaller.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.100 align:middle line:10%
They can fit into that
same receptor site.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.570 align:middle line:10%
When they do, they block
iodine from being absorbed.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not until your body
has a surplus of iodine

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.230 align:middle line:84%
that it starts to release
the fluorine, and chloride,

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and bromine, and things like
that so the iodine can then

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.790 align:middle line:90%
fit into that receptor site.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So when I teach toxicology
in the universities,

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:53.880 align:middle line:84%
first thing I tell people is
if you're nutrient deficient,

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.810 align:middle line:90%
you're a toxin sponge.

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.930 align:middle line:10%
Just like I'm showing
you here, if you're

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.320 align:middle line:10%
missing iodine in
that receptor site

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.250 align:middle line:10%
and you come into contact
with fluoride in the water,

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:08.930 align:middle line:10%
chlorine in the water--

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:14.270 align:middle line:10%
bromine is a
preservative in breads.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Anything baked has
bromine as a preservative.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you're coming into contact
with these other toxic elements

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're missing
that iodine, they're

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.630 align:middle line:84%
getting stuffed into
that receptor site.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally
absorbing these.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.440 align:middle line:84%
You're just readily
absorbing these nutrients.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, fluoride toxicity
causes the bone to dissolve.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.240 align:middle line:84%
It actually causes the teeth
to dissolve, believe it or not.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But isn't fluoride supposed
to be good for our teeth?

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what they tell us.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe them, but
that's what they tell us.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:58.640 align:middle line:84%
If you get enough
fluoride into your teeth,

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.040 align:middle line:84%
your teeth will
rot and fall out.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:08.619 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one of the toxic
reactions to fluoride.

00:37:08.619 --> 00:37:10.910 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the signs of
fluoride toxicity, actually.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.600 align:middle line:90%
Your teeth fall out.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It does the same
thing with your bones.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:16.970 align:middle line:90%
It rots your bones.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:10%
It causes the bones to
become soft and brittle.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that why--

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.321 align:middle line:84%
I read a study within
the last couple years

00:37:23.321 --> 00:37:25.930 align:middle line:84%
that fluoride has been
linked to osteosarcoma.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's why?

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Bone cancer.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Bone cancer.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.260 align:middle line:10%
It weakens the bone.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.680 align:middle line:10%
It weakens the teeth, weakens
the jaw, weakens the bones.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.930 align:middle line:10%
Long bones, femurs.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:43.640 align:middle line:10%
Look at all the hip replacements
that have to happen, you know?

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.580 align:middle line:90%
We have weakened bones.

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.450 align:middle line:90%
And bones weaken as we get--

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:55.220 align:middle line:84%
bones become harder and less
flexible as we get older.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.360 align:middle line:10%
They shouldn't get more brittle.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.080 align:middle line:10%
If we have a decent diet, we're
getting plenty of minerals.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:06.800 align:middle line:84%
We mineralize our bones,
they should become stiffer,

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.080 align:middle line:90%
not more brittle.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But almost invariably
in most elderly--

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I remember my grandma
before she died,

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.379 align:middle line:90%
I think she broke her hip--

00:38:15.379 --> 00:38:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> If you give her a hug.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>> She broke her hip
one time just walking.

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:10%
Terribly brittle bones.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:28.160 align:middle line:10%
We've been fluorinated
in the United States

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.380 align:middle line:10%
for about 70 years.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Heavily fluorinated.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:90%
And osteoporosis is rampant.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.110 align:middle line:84%
It's rampant in
men, elderly men.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:10%
And testosterone, which
is our boy hormone,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.280 align:middle line:10%
should keep our bones strong.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:10%
And despite that, the fluoride's
still eating away at our bones.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk about the relationship
of fulvic acid in treating

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.180 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.920 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Fulvic acid is the end
product of decomposition

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.020 align:middle line:90%
of organic matter.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.410 align:middle line:90%
As, I think, it composts--

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:21.480 align:middle line:84%
as compost breaks down, it
ends up in this black soil.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Good stuff.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Good stuff.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:26.560 align:middle line:10%
And the reason it's good
stuff is that decomposition,

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.190 align:middle line:10%
you took 50 pounds of
waste and decompose

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:10%
down to five pounds
of, say, soil.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.280 align:middle line:10%
What you have there
in that soil is

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.580 align:middle line:10%
the nutrition of
50 pounds of waste

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.710 align:middle line:10%
all concentrated
down into that soil.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:49.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's things
called humic shale.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.680 align:middle line:10%
They're deposits all
around the world.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:57.290 align:middle line:10%
And what they are
is deposits of--

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:10%
somehow, at some
point in history,

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.420 align:middle line:10%
they were massive forests that
got thousands of tons of dirt

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:09.110 align:middle line:10%
dumped on them followed by
thousands of gallons of water.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:10%
In certain places, they got
so much dirt dumped on them

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:18.380 align:middle line:10%
that they get pushed lower
into the crust and the amount

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.400 align:middle line:10%
of pressure they were under
caused that biomass to convert

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.500 align:middle line:10%
into petroleum.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.120 align:middle line:10%
In other places,
it was much closer

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.440 align:middle line:10%
to the surface and the microbes
in the soil, the bacteria

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.330 align:middle line:10%
and all the different
microbes in the soil,

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:38.780 align:middle line:10%
acted on that biomass,
all this covered forest,

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.300 align:middle line:10%
and decomposed it.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.640 align:middle line:10%
What we have left over
from that is humic shale.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:10%
It's basically the compost soil.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:10%
What we do is we take that
and we extract fulvic acid.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:57.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, fulvic acid is the
absolute smallest particle

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.910 align:middle line:10%
of that compost, if you will.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.210 align:middle line:10%
It has all the
genetic information,

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:09.390 align:middle line:10%
all of the nutrition, all
of the antioxidant capacity.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.390 align:middle line:10%
Fulvic acid, the
molecule of fulvic acid

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:16.580 align:middle line:10%
has 14 tetra trillion
electrons it can donate.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Tetra trillion.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.131 align:middle line:10%
>> That's 21 zeros behind 14.

00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:22.630 align:middle line:10%
>> That's a number
you can't fathom.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:24.770 align:middle line:10%
>> It's unfathomable.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:28.400 align:middle line:10%
One molecule has that
many electrons to donate.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.130 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's one of the
problems with free radicals.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:35.010 align:middle line:10%
It is a free radical quencher.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.706 align:middle line:10%
And it's so tiny that
it works on the outside

00:41:38.706 --> 00:41:40.580 align:middle line:10%
of the cell, works on
the inside of the cell,

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.640 align:middle line:10%
and it works on the various
components of the cell.

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.400 align:middle line:10%
Most importantly, it
works in the mitochondria,

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.930 align:middle line:10%
the generator of the cell.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.390 align:middle line:10%
The power generator
for the cell.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.250 align:middle line:84%
In the Krebs cycle,
the energy cycle

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.740 align:middle line:84%
that the mitochondria
has to go through

00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to produce cellular energy,
ATP, carbohydrate is split.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.020 align:middle line:84%
You have a carbon and
hydrogen bond that is split,

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and when that happens,
energy is released.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.960 align:middle line:84%
The mitochondria produce
ATP, ATP goes out

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the cell,
the cell does its job.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.090 align:middle line:10%
The problem is
when that happens,

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:25.070 align:middle line:10%
you have a carbon fragment
and a hydrogen fragment.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.860 align:middle line:10%
Those are called free radicals.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:10%
We call them cellular
debris, free radicals.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.820 align:middle line:10%
In essence, it's
kind of like if you

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.600 align:middle line:10%
had a wood stove and you
burnt wood in there for a week

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.880 align:middle line:10%
and never cleaned the ash out.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.590 align:middle line:10%
Eventually, the
wood's full of ash

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:10%
and you can't burn anything.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:45.020 align:middle line:10%
That's what happens with our
cells and causes them to die.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:10%
They have so many fragments
of nutrients floating around

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.400 align:middle line:10%
in them that it
snuffs the cell out.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.290 align:middle line:10%
It can't burn anymore.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:10%
You can't metabolize anymore.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Fulvic acid goes
into the cell and can

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.220 align:middle line:84%
convert all of those
fragments of nutrients

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.680 align:middle line:90%
back into nutrition.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:09.047 align:middle line:90%
>> It's some cool stuff.

00:43:09.047 --> 00:43:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very cool stuff.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Very cool stuff.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.308 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never heard
of that before.

00:43:12.308 --> 00:43:17.210 align:middle line:10%
>> And nothing else
does that, is the thing.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:20.060 align:middle line:90%
It's an anti-aging agent.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:23.270 align:middle line:90%
It's an antioxidant agent.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:29.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a molecule that
will carry electricity.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:34.295 align:middle line:10%
So it acts as an electrolyte
in your cell without minerals.

00:43:34.295 --> 00:43:37.990 align:middle line:90%


00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.350 align:middle line:10%
It's a phenomenon.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.150 align:middle line:10%
>> It is.

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.270 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a phenomenon.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:47.040 align:middle line:84%
When you're feeling
tired, when you're tired

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
ran down, you just

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.510 align:middle line:84%
don't have a lot of energy,
on a cellular level,

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:84%
your cells aren't carrying an
electrical charge very well.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.892 align:middle line:84%
So if we can recharge the
battery, quote unquote,

00:44:00.892 --> 00:44:02.786 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you
have energy again.

00:44:02.786 --> 00:44:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Things start functioning
the way they should.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.789 align:middle line:84%
They have the
electricity to operate.

00:44:07.789 --> 00:44:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And our bodies are electric.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:09.913 align:middle line:90%
>> They're electric.

00:44:09.913 --> 00:44:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, this whole function
here of enhancing

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:21.490 align:middle line:84%
the electrical capacity,
converting free radicals back

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:26.590 align:middle line:84%
into nutrition is all
wonderful, but fulvic acid also

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:32.130 align:middle line:90%
acts as a delivery system.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.500 align:middle line:10%
You can bond nutrients
to fulvic acid

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.550 align:middle line:10%
and it will deliver
those nutrients.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a nano molecule.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a micro nano
molecule, actually.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:44.290 align:middle line:90%
It's smaller than nano.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it crosses
all barriers in the body.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Blood brain barrier, everything.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And it can carry nutrients
to whatever tissue,

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.190 align:middle line:90%
whatever cells.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:03.215 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you need them to
go deliver the nutrients.

00:45:03.215 --> 00:45:04.840 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
about it, though,

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.370 align:middle line:84%
is once it delivers
the nutrients,

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:13.270 align:middle line:84%
it will take the waste, or
heavy metals, or pesticides,

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:16.630 align:middle line:84%
or you name it, anything
that the cell doesn't want

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.370 align:middle line:84%
or anything that's harming
the cell, pick that up.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:26.590 align:middle line:10%
It will bond that, we'll
say mercury, to fulvic acid

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.770 align:middle line:10%
and carry it out of the system.

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So you get this exchange
that happens there.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So I tell everybody it acts as
the UPS man and the garbage man

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.860 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Delivers its package, picks
up the garbage and takes it

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:41.920 align:middle line:10%
out.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:10%
So when it comes to the
cancer, cancer cells

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.320 align:middle line:10%
are very, very low
electrical activity.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.860 align:middle line:10%
So if we can raise their
electrical activity, which

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.290 align:middle line:10%
fulvic acid does, we kill them.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:59.180 align:middle line:10%


00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:04.370 align:middle line:10%
High electrical activity
kills cancer cells.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in history
that had cancer

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:11.520 align:middle line:84%
at the moment they
were hit by lightning--

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.490 align:middle line:84%
everyone that survived lightning
strikes that had had cancer,

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.650 align:middle line:84%
didn't have cancer after
they were hit by lightning.

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:19.450 align:middle line:90%
>> No kidding.

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> No kidding.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Across the board.

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.550 align:middle line:10%
Every cancer patient that--

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Because that electrical
energy killed the cancer.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.185 align:middle line:10%
>> Killed the cancer.

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:29.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And so that's what
fulvic acid does?

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:34.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Fulvic acid has that
electrolyte capacity to raise

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:10%
the electrical
activity in the cells,

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:39.530 align:middle line:10%
and it destroys
cancer cells that way.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:43.030 align:middle line:84%
We also have the capacity
of removing the waste,

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:90%
delivering the nutrition.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:50.370 align:middle line:84%
That's not to mention,
depending on the fulvic acid

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that you're getting-- our
fulvic acid is high in carbon,

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:84%
high in hydrogen,
and high in oxygen.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we go back to what I
first started talking about,

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:05.710 align:middle line:84%
this is how we use fulvic
acid for balancing that 96.3%

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:08.840 align:middle line:90%
of our body's composition.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.520 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, we use that
in conjunction with diet,

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.240 align:middle line:84%
with water, with all
these other things,

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and everything just
happens faster.

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.530 align:middle line:84%
We can get them well faster
with the fulvic acid.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:25.300 align:middle line:10%
I believe God knew we were
going to mess up things here

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.910 align:middle line:10%
and he pre-programmed
into the mix

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:34.220 align:middle line:10%
this humic shale that is
so rich in fulvic acid,

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.220 align:middle line:10%
and just was waiting for
us to discover it so we

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.230 align:middle line:10%
could use it to fix things.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And my family, my wife
has taken fulvic acid

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.210 align:middle line:90%
through every pregnancy.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:47.350 align:middle line:84%
We have extremely
healthy children.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I've been using and researching
fulvic acid since 1996.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I've had upwards of
8,000 patients take this,

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.840 align:middle line:90%
and we've only had good results.

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> 8,000 patients.

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Never had any trouble.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:90%
My children take it every day.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.107 align:middle line:90%


00:48:09.107 --> 00:48:10.690 align:middle line:10%
We live on this
planet, so we're going

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:12.880 align:middle line:10%
to be exposed to
this environment.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.530 align:middle line:10%
And for me, for my children,
I want to protect them

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.650 align:middle line:10%
as much as possible.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:21.470 align:middle line:90%
And so my children use--

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:84%
we give them the
fulvic every day.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Every day.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:27.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Why is it that more people
haven't heard about these

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.290 align:middle line:10%
natural treatments for cancer?

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>> First off, the
practitioners have been,

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the doctors have been persecuted
so horribly they're afraid

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:37.910 align:middle line:90%
to advertise.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.910 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid to put
their hands up saying, OK,

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:40.710 align:middle line:90%
we're over here.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.120 align:middle line:90%
It's working.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:42.920 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:47.800 align:middle line:10%
They're afraid to do that
for fear of being squashed

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.700 align:middle line:10%
or attacked.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.310 align:middle line:10%
That is first and foremost.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:54.170 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they don't
advertise because they're

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:56.060 align:middle line:10%
afraid of getting
attacked, number one.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:49:00.810 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, people
don't hear about it.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:04.400 align:middle line:10%
Number two, media
does not cover it.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.560 align:middle line:10%
You know, media has no coverage
of what's happening there.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:13.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Not to interrupt you here,
but a perfect example is that

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:17.720 align:middle line:10%
a while back we had the
CDC story of the vaccines,

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.670 align:middle line:10%
the MMR vaccine being
definitively linked,

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:22.310 align:middle line:10%
the whistleblower, autism.

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:23.990 align:middle line:10%
And where was the
media coverage?

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Zero.

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:26.266 align:middle line:10%
Zero.

00:49:26.266 --> 00:49:31.660 align:middle line:10%
Those folks trying
to get the story out,

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:35.420 align:middle line:10%
they're even under
fire for doing that.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the problem.

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:44.390 align:middle line:84%
The politics of medicine
are keeping people

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:46.905 align:middle line:84%
from getting better,
is the problem.

00:49:46.905 --> 00:49:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say the
politics of cancer,

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:49.613 align:middle line:90%
kind of elaborate on that.

00:49:49.613 --> 00:49:51.770 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we make the maximum
amount of money on cancer?

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the politics.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Bottom line is money.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Bottom line.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:middle line:84%
If the pharmaceutical companies
cannot patent a treatment,

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.180 align:middle line:84%
they can't maximize
their income on it.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.270 align:middle line:84%
They can't maximize
their profit shares.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it
doesn't behoove them

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:19.690 align:middle line:90%
to use those types of remedies.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:25.040 align:middle line:10%
And if you could sell a
medication to a patient

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.462 align:middle line:10%
to keep them alive--

00:50:27.462 --> 00:50:29.170 align:middle line:10%
maybe extend their
life, keep them alive.

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:32.284 align:middle line:10%
Not make them healthy,
but extend their life.

00:50:32.284 --> 00:50:34.325 align:middle line:10%
Every month that they have
to buy that medication

00:50:34.325 --> 00:50:37.970 align:middle line:10%
is another sale you made.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:39.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the business
of medicine.

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:41.840 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.680 align:middle line:90%
It's unfortunate.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, medicine is
as much a business

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.950 align:middle line:90%
as it is a practice anymore.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.042 align:middle line:90%
It's a shame.

00:50:49.042 --> 00:50:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So why haven't more people
heard about these treatments?

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.550 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
selling more drugs.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Maximizing revenues.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.260 align:middle line:90%
This is the cancer industry.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.890 align:middle line:10%
>> The cancer industry is a
multibillion dollar industry.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:04.310 align:middle line:10%
And the doctors that are
graduating from med school

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.010 align:middle line:10%
are funded by
pharmaceutical industries.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So what they're
learning in school

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:12.350 align:middle line:84%
is how to use drugs
to mask the symptoms

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and how to cut out
specific body parts.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, don't get me
wrong, there may

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.410 align:middle line:84%
be times in a crisis
situation where

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:21.110 align:middle line:84%
you have to cut out a body
part, or fix a broken bone,

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:23.390 align:middle line:84%
or help somebody
through a heart attack,

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:29.300 align:middle line:84%
but they're not being taught
on how to get sick people well.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They're driving
the symptoms deeper

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.470 align:middle line:90%
by giving people medication.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And the cancer
industry is really

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:39.650 align:middle line:84%
driven by greed and money
because there is a cure.

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:42.500 align:middle line:84%
People are healing
from cancer every day

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.020 align:middle line:90%
without the use of toxic drugs.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.630 align:middle line:84%
There are literally
thousands and thousands

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:50.720 align:middle line:84%
of published studies that
prove the effectiveness

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.280 align:middle line:90%
of natural medicine.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:57.650 align:middle line:84%
But you can't patent a plant
and you can't patent an herb.

00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, there is no money and
no financial gain in teaching

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:03.120 align:middle line:90%
people about these things.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.810 align:middle line:10%
>> The average cancer care for
a person from stage one to stage

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:09.540 align:middle line:10%
four will range anywhere from
$350,000 to $1.4 by the end

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.670 align:middle line:10%
of stage four.

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:12.410 align:middle line:10%
Million dollars.

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:14.450 align:middle line:10%
So the thing is they
make money on that.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.240 align:middle line:10%
And now with the recurrence
rate being anywhere between 50%

00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:20.420 align:middle line:10%
and 80% within five years
from conventional treatment,

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.670 align:middle line:10%
then we get you twice.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.710 align:middle line:10%
So I tell my patients, even
if you have insurance--

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.100 align:middle line:10%
even when people have
great insurance, which

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:30.697 align:middle line:10%
is helpful for some
catastrophic care,

00:52:30.697 --> 00:52:32.030 align:middle line:10%
they still have to pay a co-pay.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:34.590 align:middle line:10%
They still have to pay 10%,
20% of the hospitalization.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:37.520 align:middle line:10%
So unless you have $100,000
or more extra dollars

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.470 align:middle line:10%
in the bank that's
cash to be given,

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:41.810 align:middle line:10%
the second most common cause
of foreclosure in America

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.261 align:middle line:10%
is health care costs.

00:52:43.261 --> 00:52:45.260 align:middle line:10%
So not only are we
bankrupting them on one side,

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.187 align:middle line:10%
we're bankrupting
their health as well.

00:52:47.187 --> 00:52:48.770 align:middle line:10%
And we have to look
at now what can we

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.450 align:middle line:10%
do that's cheaper,
that's effective,

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:52.820 align:middle line:10%
and has access to everybody,
regardless of whether they

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.250 align:middle line:10%
have an insurance card or not.

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:58.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Managing symptoms, managing
disease, it's very profitable.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.790 align:middle line:10%
As is the oncological field
because of its monopoly status.

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:04.740 align:middle line:10%
But healing is a whole
different paradigm,

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.697 align:middle line:10%
and that's why sometimes
never the twain

00:53:06.697 --> 00:53:08.780 align:middle line:10%
shall meet when you try
to talk to some folks that

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.332 align:middle line:10%
are programmed in a way
that I was growing up.

00:53:11.332 --> 00:53:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like a completely
different language

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to learn that the symptoms
are actually good.

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.370 align:middle line:90%
You welcome them.

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:17.828 align:middle line:84%
Even though they
may be unpleasant,

00:53:17.828 --> 00:53:19.850 align:middle line:84%
but they're very
focused on telling you

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:21.420 align:middle line:84%
something about
what's happening.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you learn the
language and listen,

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.710 align:middle line:90%
you can change your future.

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating information, folks.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.340 align:middle line:84%
In tonight's episode, we've
heard from many medical doctors

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that are using natural
treatments in their practices

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:35.840 align:middle line:90%
to heal cancer.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow night, we're
going to actually

00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:39.470 align:middle line:84%
be able to interview
some doctors that

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:42.200 align:middle line:84%
have used these
treatments on themselves

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.742 align:middle line:84%
when they were
diagnosed with cancer.

00:53:43.742 --> 00:53:45.741 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to get
this information straight

00:53:45.741 --> 00:53:48.560 align:middle line:84%
from the doctors that have
treated themselves successfully

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.602 align:middle line:90%
when they were diagnosed.

00:53:49.602 --> 00:53:52.060 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be an episode
that you don't want to miss,

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.394 align:middle line:90%
and I hope you tell you friends.

00:53:53.394 --> 00:53:54.851 align:middle line:84%
Information that
can save your life

00:53:54.851 --> 00:53:56.000 align:middle line:90%
or the life of a loved one.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.333 align:middle line:90%
Hope you enjoyed tonight's show.

00:53:57.333 --> 00:53:59.410 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow night's show is
going to be even better.

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.410 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:01.284 align:middle line:90%
Have a great evening.

00:54:01.284 --> 00:54:12.380 align:middle line:90%


00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here with
Chris Walsh today.

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:16.960 align:middle line:84%
We're at the Center for Advanced
Medicine and Clinical Research.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.580 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Rashid Buttar's
office in North Carolina.

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:20.510 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for being with
us here today, Chris.

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:21.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Good to be here.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:21.880 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for having me.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.680 align:middle line:10%
>> And we're sitting
in front of the fish.

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.530 align:middle line:10%
So tell me tell
me about the fish.

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.331 align:middle line:10%
What do they reminds you of?

00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It reminds me of being here
four years ago when I started

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.000 align:middle line:90%
my treatment here.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.458 align:middle line:84%
I used to stare at
them while I was

00:54:32.458 --> 00:54:35.050 align:middle line:90%
waiting in the waiting room.

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Kind of lost, not knowing what
my future was going to be.

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of diving into a
whole new world of alternative

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:44.200 align:middle line:84%
medicine and finding
a way to health.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So you were here
for what reason?

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.640 align:middle line:84%
You were here because you
had been diagnosed with what?

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I had Clark's
level four melanoma,

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:54.820 align:middle line:84%
which was supposedly the worst
kind of melanoma in the deepest

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:55.760 align:middle line:90%
layer of the skin.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Skin cancer.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Skin cancer.

00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:01.870 align:middle line:84%
It was four years ago almost
today I was diagnosed.

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And from what we found out, it
had kind of made its tentacles

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:08.470 align:middle line:90%
inside my leg.

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So they thought that I probably
wouldn't have a leg from here.

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, obviously, you know
the conventional treatments

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.310 align:middle line:90%
would have made it worse.

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:20.101 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have had a
leg, and I'd probably

00:55:20.101 --> 00:55:21.340 align:middle line:90%
be dead now anyway.

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.110 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I was
really scrambling.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I went and just kind
of did as much research

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.200 align:middle line:90%
as I could.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.074 align:middle line:84%
I actually went and
found your book, "Cancer:

00:55:28.074 --> 00:55:30.086 align:middle line:84%
Step Outside the Box,"
which really opened

00:55:30.086 --> 00:55:31.210 align:middle line:90%
my eyes to a lot of things.

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had no idea
about any of this.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I went and bought Patrick
Quillin's book, "Beating Cancer

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.360 align:middle line:90%
with Nutrition."

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Started following
that immediately.

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And I saw doctor Dr.
Buttar speak at a--

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:46.060 align:middle line:84%
he did a little seminar
at his old office.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what he did,
but I remember thinking,

00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:49.944 align:middle line:84%
that place seems
really interesting.

00:55:49.944 --> 00:55:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So I called my buddy up, but
I couldn't remember his name.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.920 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, it's Dr. Buttar.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I looked him up and he just
so happens to treat cancer.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.265 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I don't
like my options now.

00:55:59.265 --> 00:56:01.598 align:middle line:84%
I already talked to supposedly
the best guy in Cleveland

00:56:01.598 --> 00:56:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and that's not what
I was going to do.

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So I called Dr. Buttar,
I got a consultation,

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and within the first 15 minutes,
I knew I was going to do it.

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't know anything
about holistic or alternative

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:21.780 align:middle line:84%
medicine, and what he said to
me just made so much sense.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.585 align:middle line:84%
Like, why isn't
everybody doing this?

00:56:23.585 --> 00:56:24.460 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:29.716 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like such common sense
to me, but I guess it's not.

00:56:29.716 --> 00:56:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I played golf professionally
for the last 10 years.

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.215 align:middle line:84%
And so I was in
the sun every day

00:56:33.215 --> 00:56:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and slathering on
sunscreen thinking

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:38.591 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing myself a
favor, but since then I've

00:56:38.591 --> 00:56:40.590 align:middle line:84%
come to learn that I think
that was probably one

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:41.820 align:middle line:90%
of the causes of skin cancer.

00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Just bathing in those
chemicals every day.

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:45.850 align:middle line:90%
So I got to Dr. Buttar.

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:49.770 align:middle line:84%
As they do all the
tests, I had high levels

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:52.770 align:middle line:84%
of mercury, lead,
barium, some just really

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:54.720 align:middle line:90%
strange, heavy metals.

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I had parasites, I had
viruses, my immune system

00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:59.640 align:middle line:90%
was really weak.

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:03.180 align:middle line:84%
The strength of my
immune system was weak.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.070 align:middle line:90%
I had amalgams in my mouth.

00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a lot of
mercury, which really

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.630 align:middle line:90%
disrupts the immune system.

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So did he put you on a
protocol to remove the mercury?

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yup.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Pretty serious detoxification.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.750 align:middle line:84%
I went through chelation
therapy for 20 weeks.

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:21.330 align:middle line:84%
I was taking about
100 supplements a day

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:23.430 align:middle line:90%
to kind of rebalance everything.

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:25.920 align:middle line:84%
The terrain in my body was
pretty ripe for cancer to grow,

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.231 align:middle line:90%
rather than for health.

00:57:28.231 --> 00:57:29.980 align:middle line:84%
So we had to change a
lot of those things.

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of gut issues.

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.390 align:middle line:84%
The bacteria in my gut
wasn't working properly.

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:38.220 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what it
was supposed to be.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The good bacteria,
the healthy flora.

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.802 align:middle line:90%
>> The balance was way off.

00:57:43.802 --> 00:57:45.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wasn't eating
properly at the time.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.850 align:middle line:10%
I completely changed
my diet and completely

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:52.800 align:middle line:10%
changed using the cookware
I used, the soap I used,

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.170 align:middle line:10%
the detergent, everything.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:57.420 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I changed
everything in my life.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything's so toxic and
everything that most people

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:02.720 align:middle line:90%
use that's mainstream is toxic.

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:05.070 align:middle line:84%
They all lead to cancer, so
I just changed everything.

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And apparently it worked.

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It worked well.

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I see two legs.

00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I have two legs.

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling great.

00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:11.860 align:middle line:90%
My health's never been better.

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.520 align:middle line:90%
I never get sick.

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.840 align:middle line:90%
I just feel totally different.

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome, man.

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:18.216 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been a good
learning experience.

00:58:18.216 --> 00:58:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So the cancer is
completely gone now?

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Completely gone.

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:25.680 align:middle line:84%
My immune system is back
functioning perfectly.

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm as healthy as a
newborn baby, I guess.

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's awesome.

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I know that the testing
that he's done now,

00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I know Dr. Buttar's level
of impeccable records.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know that by talking
to you here that he's done

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.570 align:middle line:84%
the tests to show that
there's no cancer--

00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>> --that can be
detected in your body.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.710 align:middle line:84%
We did the test when I started,
and throughout the protocol,

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:51.130 align:middle line:90%
and when I was done.

00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Everything came back great.

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:53.490 align:middle line:90%
I was healthy.

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.440 align:middle line:84%
The metals were
gone, the parasites,

00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.410 align:middle line:90%
the viruses were gone.

00:58:56.410 --> 00:59:00.364 align:middle line:84%
My immune system and immune
function came back to normal.

00:59:00.364 --> 00:59:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is so vital
in treating cancer.

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>> The immune system is
actually what does the work.

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> The body kills the cancer.

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> A good doctor aids the immune
system in fighting it off.

00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:12.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you go get
radiation or chemotherapy

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:15.697 align:middle line:84%
and the cancer is
gone, the environment

00:59:15.697 --> 00:59:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is still there for
the cancer to grow.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.613 align:middle line:90%
Your immune system doesn't work.

00:59:18.613 --> 00:59:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it will come back.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.154 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
all the time.

00:59:21.154 --> 00:59:23.071 align:middle line:84%
It happened to both my
parents, unfortunately.

00:59:23.071 --> 00:59:23.870 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it.

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Mine too.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is really
encouraging, Chris.

00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:29.557 align:middle line:90%
You're here four years later.

00:59:29.557 --> 00:59:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Four years later.

00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You were told that you
wouldn't have six months

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:33.510 align:middle line:90%
or you'd have a leg missing.

00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost four years to the day.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:36.944 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's about
four years to the day.

00:59:36.944 --> 00:59:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're back at the
fish four years later.

00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Chris, your story is
an inspiration to me.

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I know it's an
inspiration to everybody

00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:44.190 align:middle line:90%
that's watching it right now.

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
spending the time--

00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> No problem.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.480 align:middle line:90%
Happy to be here.

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:49.830 align:middle line:90%
