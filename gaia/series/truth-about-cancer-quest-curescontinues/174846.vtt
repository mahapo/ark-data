00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back to "The Quest
For the Cures Continues".

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:84%
If you watched last night's
episode-- and I hope you did--

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.240 align:middle line:84%
you learned about some natural
nontoxic cancer therapies

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that are being used in clinics
across the United States

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:90%
to effectively treat cancer.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Now tonight, we're going to find
out from actual physicians that

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
have been diagnosed with
cancer themselves what

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:90%
they did to treat their cancer.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Now that was something
that I wanted

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.260 align:middle line:84%
to know when my mom
and dad were diagnosed.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I remember vividly, both of them
being in the operating room,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and asking the surgeons
what should we do?

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if you
were diagnosed with cancer?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
We wanted that expert opinion
in order to make our decision.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Now if you remember the
episode a few episodes ago,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Tony Jimenez from
the Hope4Cancer clinic

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
down in Tijuana, he
mentioned the fact

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:84%
that upwards of
80% of oncologists,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
when they were surveyed, said
that they or their family

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:84%
would not use
chemotherapy if they

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.650 align:middle line:90%
were diagnosed with cancer.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And that blew me away.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the
professionals that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.320 align:middle line:84%
are prescribing these treatments
would not use them themselves,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.987 align:middle line:84%
that's a pretty telling
statistic to me.

00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:21.736 align:middle line:84%
So tonight we're going
to learn about what

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
these physicians
actually did to treat

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
their cancer in a natural way,
and these physicians are still

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.232 align:middle line:90%
alive to give us their story.

00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
the treatments must

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
have been pretty successful
because they're here

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.562 align:middle line:90%
to tell them to us.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be an
encouraging show to you.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.902 align:middle line:90%
I know it was to me.

00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn from
actual cancer patients that

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
cured their cancer naturally,
and they happen to be doctors.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the show.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.062 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you at the end.

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:47.534 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:52.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>> You are sitting here today.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.481 align:middle line:84%
You look like the
picture of health.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.480 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't the case
four or five years ago.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not at all.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us your personal story.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.835 align:middle line:10%
>> It's been almost five, five
and a half, six years ago,

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:03.960 align:middle line:10%
I started having
severe headaches.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:10%
And obviously, what I do, I'm
taking care of people every day

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.684 align:middle line:10%
with headaches.

00:02:08.684 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Something, OK, it's
probably just coming

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:90%
from my spine or my nerves.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting
adjusted, headaches

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:84%
were doing phenomenal,
but it kept coming back.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I then finally
started going weak.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:90%
I was losing weight.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:84%
I did some blood work, and the
blood-- my white blood cells,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I was anemic, things
were going on.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
At that point, we knew
something was going on.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.270 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with Lyme
disease at that time.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So we started taking
care of the Lyme.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.067 align:middle line:84%
I ran another test,
still not feeling good,

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:90%
but ran another Lyme test.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:90%
The Lyme was cleared.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:90%
It cleared out the Lyme.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point I knew
that it was time for an MRI.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.885 align:middle line:90%
So I had one of my doctor--

00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
a friend of mine
whose wife is a nurse,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
said it's time to get
an MRI, and I knew it.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.505 align:middle line:90%
I knew I didn't want an MRI.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I got an MRI about
3:30 in the afternoon--

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and I say the timing
for a reason--

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.400 align:middle line:84%
about 3:30 afternoon,
I had my MRI.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
They told me they'd let me
know the next day, the results.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:90%
I went home.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I slept pretty much 18
hours a day, 19 hours a day.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:90%
I could barely stand up.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I was laying on the
couch, and at that time

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
I woke up to my wife and
my oldest son on top of me,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:90%
crying.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And it literally was
like someone died.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I knew something
was wrong at that time.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:90%
And my wife is crying.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.922 align:middle line:84%
She said, they already
called for your MRI.

00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking I
must have slept till--

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking it's
the next day already.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
It was an hour and a
half, two hours later.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
They literally-- the radiologist
held my X-ray up to the light,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:84%
or my MRI up to the
light, looked at it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and immediately, immediately
saw two huge tumors in my brain

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:84%
stem and I had two
small ones by the eyes.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.075 align:middle line:84%
He said I needed to get
to Northwestern Hospital,

00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:49.450 align:middle line:84%
meaning they didn't even want
me to go through the night.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:84%
They thought I literally
wouldn't wake up

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:90%
It was just that severe.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So I rushed to Northwestern
immediately, it was about 5:30,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:90%
got to Northwestern around 6:30.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
When I got there, they
assumed that this was benign.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.974 align:middle line:90%
they did no other tests.

00:04:04.974 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
They assumed this is
going to be benign.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go up there.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.145 align:middle line:84%
You're young, you're
healthy, it's going to--

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to have any
issues with the surgery.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
But I had so much cerebral
spinal fluid in the brain

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
because the tumors were
putting so much pressure

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:84%
on the spinal cord, like
literally, the spinal fluid

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:84%
couldn't get down
my spinal cord.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So all the spinal fluid
would stay up here.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.528 align:middle line:84%
So that's what would
create my headaches.

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So if I would lay down
for a while and relax,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
the spinal fluid would be
able to settle back down.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they came in, I
walked into the room,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
my mother had driven about two
hours quickly to be there ,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I walked in the room, my mother
and my wife were in there.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
The doctor looked at my wife
and my mother and they said,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to see this.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
At that time, is they
had to take a drill

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
and drill down
the top of my head

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
here to put a tube down there
to start draining the fluid,

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.340 align:middle line:84%
there was so much
fluid in my brain.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And you still
got a scar there.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I got a scar here
and I have a scar here.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But yes, they went down this
way to take the fluid out

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:90%
of my brain.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Literally, they
can't use medication

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
when they put a
hole in your head.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So they literally-- I
had no medication at all,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:84%
they had to drill a hole
down through my head

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.484 align:middle line:90%
to put a tube in there.

00:05:16.484 --> 00:05:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And it literally-- and
people say, what did it

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:90%
feel like, or sound like?

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It sounded like
somebody was going

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.819 align:middle line:84%
through tile or porcelain, like
they were drilling to the head

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:25.860 align:middle line:90%
and then pulling back up.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like a little
saw, it looks like.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:90%
So they put the tube in there.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you, at
that point you're like,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.010 align:middle line:90%
thank god for modern medicine.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.377 align:middle line:90%
Headaches went away immediately.

00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:90%
They got the fluid out of there.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
medicine's there for.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Medicine's crisis care.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.672 align:middle line:84%
I was in a crisis,
but there was no way

00:05:41.672 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
they were going to get
me back to health again.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But it was definitely
there for crisis.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:90%
They got the fluid out of there.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:90%
I could function.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The next day the neurosurgeon
came in and said,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.492 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be easy.

00:05:53.492 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go through
about a week of preparation

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:84%
to get you ready, make sure
you can handle the surgery.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
do a brain surgery.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.356 align:middle line:84%
So they were going to have to
go right up inside of there,

00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and they were just going to
go in and cut out the tumors.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't do
any other blood work.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
They didn't test anything
else but basic stuff

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.330 align:middle line:90%
for the surgery.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.414 align:middle line:84%
About a week later, it
was a Tuesday morning,

00:06:14.414 --> 00:06:15.330 align:middle line:90%
I went in for surgery.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
They said it'd be about
eight to 12 hour surgery.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Ben Lerner, who wrote
the wrote the book with me,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.492 align:middle line:84%
my wife, we had tons of the
Maximized Living doctors

00:06:24.492 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and family and friends all
in the room waiting for me

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%
to come out of surgery.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And instead of being
eight or 12 hour surgery,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:90%
it was pretty quick.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
They literally-- it was
over, and I didn't know this,

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.190 align:middle line:84%
they went in the
room to tell my wife.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:90%
They said we have bad news.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't benign tumors.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.890 align:middle line:84%
It was cancerous, and when I
went to cut on the first one--

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:84%
when you cut on cancer or you
mess with it at all, it swells.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And the cancer began to swell
and it started to bleed.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, what
does the blood carry?

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:90%
More cancer.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So they said that the chances
are that I may not wake up

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.075 align:middle line:84%
in the morning because
the swelling was

00:07:05.075 --> 00:07:08.670 align:middle line:84%
so big in the brain now and
the cancer was spreading worse.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I woke up
the next morning

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and I have a tube
down my throat.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.480 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't breathe.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Tubes coming out of my stomach,
tubes coming out of my head.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
the tumors are gone.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.930 align:middle line:90%
I have no clue what's going on.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:90%
No one's telling me anything.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And finally they told me
that it wasn't benign,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:90%
that this was cancer.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.342 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't speak at
all to anyone else.

00:07:33.342 --> 00:07:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they said, we
need to do more testing.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:90%
It's worst than that.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So what could be worse than
cancer already in your brain,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:90%
and it's spreading?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:90%
They said it's worse than that.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:90%
It's the secondary.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:90%
It's secondary.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from
somewhere in the body.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.699 align:middle line:84%
So then they went in,
they did CAT scans,

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
PET scans, did everything
they could for the next three

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.370 align:middle line:90%
or four days.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.294 align:middle line:84%
They could not find any
cancer anywhere else.

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't figure it out.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So finally, they had to
do a bone marrow test.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.616 align:middle line:84%
They went in, they
drill your bone marrow,

00:07:59.616 --> 00:08:01.490 align:middle line:84%
they take out some bone
marrow, they test it.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
About 37% to 40% of my
blood was making cancer.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
diagnosed at that time

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.830 align:middle line:84%
with a multiple myeloma,
which is the myelocytes that

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.707 align:middle line:90%
were reacting.

00:08:13.707 --> 00:08:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So I had all of this myeloma
and these myelocytes,

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I had bone marrow cancer,
and because it was

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.750 align:middle line:90%
made in the blood, it spread.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:84%
What is interesting is because
of the way I was living,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
it never went to
any other organ.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Almost every single
myeloma patient,

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
it goes to the spine,
the bones crack,

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:84%
and it's a horrible death, where
mine only went up to my brain.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So whatever I was doing,
they said, how I was living,

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
at least kept it out
of the rest of my body.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.313 align:middle line:84%
Because they figured it should
have been all through my bones.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It should have been
everywhere else.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:84%
At that time, two
oncologists, they

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.130 align:middle line:84%
walked into the room with
me to give me the bad news.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And they said, the bad
news is it's incurable,

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:90%
it's already in your brain.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we could do
is bone marrow transplant,

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
high dose chemo,
and some radiation,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and that would
only buy you time.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So incurable and not
really any kind of a positive

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:90%
long-term prognosis.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> No, and they were absolutely
correct, and in their model,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.487 align:middle line:90%
they're absolutely correct.

00:09:13.487 --> 00:09:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Making you comfortable.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they would have
made me comfortable.

00:09:16.403 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
They said no matter what,
get the things in order.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.897 align:middle line:84%
And they understood
that the chances

00:09:21.897 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
of me making it-- now here's
what most people don't know

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:84%
is I walked in the
hospital 155 pounds.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:84%
At the time of diagnosis I was
119 pounds in a wheelchair.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So through all the surgeries,
laying in the hospital bed,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
going through everything
I had to go through,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't function,
I couldn't eat

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.335 align:middle line:84%
because I had the tube
going down my throat.

00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think they were
feeding me the whole time?

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Sugar.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sugar.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Luckily, we worked
with a nutritionist,

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and as soon as we found out
what was going on, is we got off

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.591 align:middle line:84%
the sugar, got to bring our own
stuff in, and started working

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:51.747 align:middle line:90%
on all that stuff.

00:09:51.747 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment, they
walked in, and most people say,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.420 align:middle line:84%
what was going
through your mind when

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:84%
they tell you it's incurable,
there's nothing they can do,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.477 align:middle line:90%
you have months to live?

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:90%
At the time, it was weeks.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.976 align:middle line:84%
With chemo and
radiation they said

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:07.490 align:middle line:90%
it may give me some few months.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:10%
I literally said to myself,
if I cut myself right now

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:10%
in this room, I cut my arm, what
would happen in the next three

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:10%
or four days?

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.340 align:middle line:10%
It would heal.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So if my brain
can heal this cut,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:90%
my brain can heal this cancer.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:84%
My heart's working, my stomach's
working, my lungs are working.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The other trillions of processes
are working in my body.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:90%
So my brain doesn't have--

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
wrong with my brain.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.658 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
wrong with healing.

00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just not
healing the cancer.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:90%
So something had to cause this.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.870 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an accident.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't genetic.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't bad luck.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
They kept saying it's just
genetic, and it refers--

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:90%
no, no.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The body's too smart to go into
something that's so negative.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
That it had to be positive,
that I was laying there, and as

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
hard as it was, I had to see
that what's going on in my body

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
was the right thing
at the right time.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Every symptom is the body
doing the right thing

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.670 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
If, right now, if I
put handcuffs on you

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.320 align:middle line:84%
and locked you up and
came at you with a knife,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.879 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
your blood pressure?

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Your blood pressure rise.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.628 align:middle line:84%
What happens your
cortisol during stress?

00:11:11.628 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Your cortisol rises.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:90%
What happens to your gut?

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.509 align:middle line:84%
You start taking away
all the nutrition.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Your body can't even
absorb nutrition

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
when you're in a fight
or flight syndrome.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, you're
nutritionally deficient,

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
your immune systems shot,
your blood pressure is rising,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:84%
now your cholesterol
is being affected.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Are you-- is that a symptom?

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.234 align:middle line:84%
Is that your genetics,
or is your body adapting?

00:11:34.234 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Is that symptom
your body adapting

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
to the stress it's put under?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.949 align:middle line:90%
It's adapting.

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is the same thing.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:90%
I knew at that moment--

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.827 align:middle line:84%
luckily, I knew what I
was supposed to know,

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:84%
which is the most
important thing is--

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I knew my body was only adapting
to the environment I had it in,

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and I had to go in and
change the environment.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.437 align:middle line:90%
>> So what did you do?

00:11:51.437 --> 00:11:52.519 align:middle line:90%
What were your treatments?

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> At that moment, I literally--
that was a Thursday morning I

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.080 align:middle line:90%
was let out.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
I literally got on a plane
at 5:00 in the afternoon

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and flew to Reno, Nevada
to see Dr. James Forsythe.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the premier
oncologists in the world.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But I went there, I
literally started treatments

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
there on Friday,
literally within days.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I wasn't
waiting on this.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And then at that
point is, what he

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
was using there is IV
vitamin C, poly-MVA,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.660 align:middle line:84%
he had his own Forsythe
immune therapies.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I was doing all different stuff.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I was doing all the diet
stuff which I knew how to do,

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.242 align:middle line:84%
working on all the
supplementation, all

00:12:25.242 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
the exercise, work,
I was doing all that.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:90%
They were killing it.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And just like I teach now
that the number one thing that

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.920 align:middle line:84%
has to be done when
someone has cancer is,

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:90%
you have to get to the cause.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
The second step is now
kill it, but if you

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.857 align:middle line:84%
don't get to the cause and stop
creating it, stop making it,

00:12:41.857 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter
if I kill it or not.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I could killed all
of this cancer,

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.704 align:middle line:84%
it would have bought me
some time, thank god,

00:12:46.704 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:84%
like chemo and radiation may do,
but if I don't stop making it,

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.270 align:middle line:84%
if I don't get to the cause,
it's going to come back anyway.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in Reno with
Dr. Forsythe, I was there

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:57.825 align:middle line:90%
so he could help kill it.

00:12:57.825 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it was spreading,
it was in my brain,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.700 align:middle line:90%
I could barely function.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So he was helping
kill the cancer.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I was working on
stopping, making

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.860 align:middle line:84%
a change in my lifestyle,
change in the environment.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.300 align:middle line:90%
I was there about three weeks.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:84%
I left there, came home, began
all the protocols at home.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:16.085 align:middle line:84%
I had ozone machine, which--
rectal ozone, PEMP, positron

00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:18.260 align:middle line:84%
electronic magnification
frequencies,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:25.580 align:middle line:84%
I was doing infrared saunas,
I was doing high dose

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.430 align:middle line:84%
proteolytic
therapies, poly-MVAs,

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I was doing probably 100, 120
supplements a day throughout.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And then my blood work was
being read at that time

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Hilu in Spain who
was another top cancer

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:90%
doctor there.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And he would read my blood,
and then I went out there,

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:90%
about four months later.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I spent two weeks there.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Amazing, following him,
watching him do what he does.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And now I send my blood over
there every three to six months

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I do my blood works here.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's obviously
going on almost four years

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
now that I'm feeling good,
doing better than ever,

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:90%
bloodworks look clear.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hilu even said to
me sending your blood

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.660 align:middle line:90%
to me, send it next year.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:84%
But I still send
it all the time.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Because for me,
medicine is there to--

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
thank god, I can run
every medical test

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.280 align:middle line:84%
on you, every
cancer test on you,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.821 align:middle line:84%
I can do every
medical test there is.

00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:90%
When would it find cancer?

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:90%
After you have it, right?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Thank god we have
those tests, but I

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:90%
don't want to wait for a test.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Medicine's early
detection of a disease

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:90%
that's already existing.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not health care.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not preventative care.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.398 align:middle line:90%
The disease is already there.

00:14:30.398 --> 00:14:32.617 align:middle line:84%
Thank god we have those
things, but those things

00:14:32.617 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:84%
aren't going to get me
back to health again.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So really what
you're stressing--

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing this
as a common thread

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
among a lot of the interviewees
for this mini-series

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:84%
is that prevention
is the key, and also

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:84%
changing the environment
of the body that

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:84%
makes it inhospitable to cancer,
because cancer doesn't live

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.480 align:middle line:84%
in certain environments
or doesn't do well

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:90%
in certain environments.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So the focus is
really prevention

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and to change that internal
terrain so that cancer

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:90%
doesn't feel like it's at home.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Again, we look at the normal
healthy cell uses oxygen

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:90%
as its respiration.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:84%
We know cancer
cell hates oxygen.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we need to
get more oxygen into the body,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:90%
and that's what ozone is doing.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of vitamin
C-- most people don't

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.725 align:middle line:84%
realize vitamin C
is helping bring

00:15:16.725 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:90%
more oxygen into the body.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:90%
I do IV hydrogen peroxide.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:90%
And I still do these things.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:90%
I do IV H2O2.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm doing things that are
also bringing in lots of oxygen

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
in my body, into my cells,
giving it the environment

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:90%
that this cancer can't live.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I do my high intensity short
duration workouts six days

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:90%
a week still.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So I do all my protocols
still, to this day,

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:84%
to make sure I'm
creating an environment

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.200 align:middle line:84%
where that cancer
can never come back.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Changing your environment
changes, the possibility

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.830 align:middle line:90%
of getting cancer.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So let me ask
you this, Dr. J.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:84%
If you were diagnosed with
colon cancer, let's say,

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.109 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:15:57.109 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I will tell you.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this does hit home.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:10%
I didn't talk about
this in the beginning,

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:10%
but early on in my
practice, I was 28 years old

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:10%
and all of a sudden, I had this
big red spot on my nose right

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And the cancer, actually,
that my grandfather had

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.506 align:middle line:84%
was a melanoma, a metastatic
melanoma, so a skin cancer.

00:16:16.506 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew I was susceptible
to something along those lines.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I grew up surfing on
the beach, so I've

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of intense
sun exposure.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Probably been burnt way
more than I would naturally

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.660 align:middle line:84%
recommend, just really because
I didn't know any better.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And so I knew I was susceptible.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And at that period
of time in my life,

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.672 align:middle line:84%
I was living, number
one, with a lot of fear.

00:16:35.672 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:90%
I had just opened a business.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.338 align:middle line:84%
I was in tremendous
amount of debt.

00:16:38.338 --> 00:16:40.126 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of people
counting on me.

00:16:40.126 --> 00:16:42.250 align:middle line:84%
There was lots-- you know,
when you run a business,

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:84%
there's confrontation, there's
all different types of issues.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.587 align:middle line:84%
And my nutrition
wasn't excellent.

00:16:48.587 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It was great, I would say,
it was a lot better than most

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:90%
people, but wasn't excellent.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of things
in my life that were issues.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked at
myself in the mirror,

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and I can see exactly
what was developing.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And I knew enough to know
that that was not normal.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And certainly I could have gone
to a dermatologist or somebody

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.310 align:middle line:84%
for a more advanced
diagnosis of it,

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:90%
but I really didn't need that.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:90%
To me, it was a wake up call.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.986 align:middle line:84%
And I think, really,
for all of us,

00:17:14.986 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
we've got to have
eyes to see and ears

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
to hear in our own life,
because ultimately,

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
if we're living in a way that's
just not beneficial to us

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and the people around us,
there's going to be wake

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
up calls.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just took inventory of
where I was at in my life.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that fear
was my dominating thought.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Fear of failure, fear
of letting people down,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and I knew I needed to work on
myself mentally, emotionally,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.259 align:middle line:90%
spiritually.

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:90%
I looked at my nutrition.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I realized, you know what,
there was probably way too

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
many carbohydrates in
there than there should be.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.370 align:middle line:90%
So I took out the carbohydrates.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:90%
I went keto, ketogenic.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:90%
I was overtraining.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
exercising too much.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So I really focused
on rest, really,

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:84%
really resting my
body well, because I

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
was in a state of
adrenal fatigue,

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and so I really needed
to rest effectively.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.596 align:middle line:84%
And I just took inventory of all
the different areas of my life.

00:18:04.596 --> 00:18:08.469 align:middle line:84%
Started doing more detox, really
trying to detoxify my liver,

00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
utilizing some
different supplements,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:84%
some different
advanced strategies.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.980 align:middle line:84%
In a matter of two months
it completely went away.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, it
was just a message

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:84%
that, hey, my body
can heal itself.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I just need to align it
with the right principles.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And certainly I
wouldn't say I was

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
in an advanced state
of cancer, but I

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
was looking at something that
had the potential to kill me.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And by just heeding
that warning,

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:39.100 align:middle line:84%
taking inventory of my life,
really getting it under check,

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I was able to heal
myself naturally.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.817 align:middle line:84%
And so I would take
the same approach.

00:18:43.817 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Question for you.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> If you were diagnosed
with cervical cancer--

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> --what would you do?

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.199 align:middle line:84%
Give me your steps to
treat cervical cancer.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'd go through
the organ cleanses.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:10%
I do them twice a year,
minimum twice a year.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.000 align:middle line:10%
You can do them as often as
every three months if you want.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Most people are able to
get them in twice a year.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:84%
They pick a season,
spring or fall.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you mean,
organ cleanses?

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Organ cleanses, you want
to do the five major ones.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is to
make sure you have

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
toxin removal, free flow of
toxins coming out of the body.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So when you have
too many toxins,

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:90%
it compromises the system.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a weak
link in the chain

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:90%
and you can develop a problem.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So you do your bowel cleansing--
you do it in this order,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
because you want to open the
last stage of toxin removal

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:29.950 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So normally the blood would be
filtering toxins to the liver,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and then the liver will
neutralize those impurities

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.959 align:middle line:90%
with an enzyme called P450.

00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the residues
go to the gallbladder

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and the gallbladder will
dump those through the bowel,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.010 align:middle line:84%
through the duodenum
and the urinary tract

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.150 align:middle line:90%
to leave the body.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So you want to open the bowel
and the urinary tract first.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So the colon cleanse and
the urinary tract cleanse,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.540 align:middle line:90%
you want to do.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.873 align:middle line:84%
Then you can move to the liver
and gallbladder, and then

00:19:54.873 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
blood system.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So once you've got
the system purified,

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:84%
make sure you don't put
anything in there that

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
would compromise it,
re-congest the system

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:90%
is usually how I put it.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
So do your green
vegetables, you may

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:84%
want to do some juice therapy,
do some spirulina and chlorella

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.880 align:middle line:84%
protein in your
juicing, and just

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:84%
get some organic, whole
foods into the system

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and get away from
the processed foods.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:90%
No processed foods.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Now there's even
some herbal boluses

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
that we instruct folks that
they can use, to get to the area

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.110 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.720 align:middle line:84%
They can do castor oil packs
to draw more cancer out

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:90%
through the skin.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.560 align:middle line:84%
You can do a
combination of things,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
not just one thing when
it comes to cancer.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
You can kind of pound
it from different areas.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And just get it to
leave the body faster.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that is consistent
with your cleanse and nourish.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>> You're gonna cleanse.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It's real basic, but
it's an old therapy.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's hundreds of years
old, if not thousands of years

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
old, and it seems to being
very basic and it's doable.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
People can do it,
and it's not going

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to cost them hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:84%
like they would for medical
treatment in a hospital.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you this, Mike.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
What would you do if
you were diagnosed today

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:90%
with prostate cancer.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.214 align:middle line:84%
What would be your
protocol that you would--

00:21:21.214 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not asking you to
recommend this to anybody.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, we don't do that.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But what would you do
personally if you--

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Personally?

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Your doctor said you
got prostate cancer.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:38.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, first thing I would do
is try to understand where did

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:10%
this prostate cancer come from?

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And a guy like myself, who
eats very healthy foods,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and superfoods, and leads
an anti-cancer lifestyle,

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:90%
this news would be a shock.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And the most likely
culprit would

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.110 align:middle line:84%
be an environmental cause,
probably a hormone disruption

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:90%
chemical.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So I would immediately start to
think maybe I'm being exposed

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:90%
to BPA, which is probably true.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I have some
level of BPA in my blood.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.256 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost
impossible to get rid of.

00:22:07.256 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And real quickly,
what is BPA?

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Bisphenol A, hormone

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a plasticizer.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's in receipts.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:90%
See, this is the thing.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
When I take a receipt
from a place of purchase,

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm touching that
receipt, and I'm

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:90%
getting BPA from that receipt.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I haven't yet made the leap--

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It stops the ink
from dissolving--

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Coating, yeah.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It stops--

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.756 align:middle line:90%
So we figure BPA.

00:22:30.756 --> 00:22:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So then in that case,
you'd want to get

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
hormone-sensitive superfoods,
or superfoods that interact

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:90%
with that metabolic pathway.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Which would be,
for example, I3C,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.360 align:middle line:84%
indole-3-carbinol, which is one
of the medicinal phytonutrient

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:84%
constituents of broccoli, yeah,
the cruciferous vegetable.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:84%
so I would immediately
start doing that.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
If it were prostate
cancer I would

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:59.860 align:middle line:84%
also really up my dosage
of resveratrol and zinc.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Both of those things
are very, very useful

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:90%
for prostate cancer prevention.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:84%
You can get zinc
in pumpkin seeds.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So I would probably increase
my intake of pumpkin seeds.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.430 align:middle line:84%
There are also
pumpkin seed proteins

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:84%
out there that maintain
many of the phytonutrients

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:90%
on the pumpkin seed.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.705 align:middle line:84%
So I would start to become a
pumpkin seed protein smoothie

00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:23.150 align:middle line:90%
guy with a lot of resveratrol.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I would also eat red
grapes with their seeds,

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and I would specifically
chew on the seeds

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to release the many
beneficial nutrients

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:90%
that the seeds contain.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad you mentioned that,
because one of the frequent

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.305 align:middle line:84%
questions that I
get from people is,

00:23:36.305 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:84%
if there's all this nutrition in
the seeds, should I chew them?

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You should chew them.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely, otherwise they
just pass right through you.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.859 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, of course.

00:23:42.859 --> 00:23:45.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I
learned being a lab scientist

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
is that human digestion
is very, very weak.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
When I built the gastric acid
digestion simulator, at first

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd made a
mistake, because most

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
of the foods that I ran
through the simulator

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.090 align:middle line:90%
were not well-digested.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that chewing is
the single most important step

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.090 align:middle line:90%
in the digestion process.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> We actually now have
to pre-chew with a chewer,

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
a chewing device, before we
put food into the gastric acid

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:90%
simulation.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a synthetic gastric
acid, I should say.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not a computer simulation.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a physical--

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.710 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you just take,
for example, beef jerky,

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and you put it into gastric
acid that's the same pH as human

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
digestive acid, it barely
gets digested at all.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.587 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:34.587 --> 00:24:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you mentioned
that, because chewing

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it help
you to digest the food,

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:90%
but also releases enzymes.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> As you chew the
food in your mouth,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
it releases enzymes that help
you digest the food as well.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You're right, and
as a detox technique,

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:84%
chewing the foods also
increases the surface area

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.150 align:middle line:90%
of the insoluble fibers.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Many of the fibers
in a chunk of food

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:90%
are locked inside the food.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:84%

fibers to be beneficial

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
available, physically available
to the digestion of liquids.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Chewing is what
allows that to happen.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
The other big aha in all of
this is that it gets us back

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to the amazing power of a
common sense, whole food diet.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.384 align:middle line:84%
>> That when you look at, hey,
there might be toxins in some

00:25:28.384 --> 00:25:30.550 align:middle line:84%
of these foods, but if you
actually eat whole foods,

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
there are natural things
in there that will absorb

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:84%
the toxins without you
even knowing about it.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So as I have
done this research,

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.240 align:middle line:84%
what it has really done is
given me more and more respect

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:50.290 align:middle line:84%
for Mother Nature, and more
amazement at how nature

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:84%
achieves balance and protects
your body from toxins

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.030 align:middle line:84%
in the environment through
things that you never were even

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:90%
aware of.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So Dr. Quillin, last
question for this interview.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:07.780 align:middle line:84%
If you were personally diagnosed
with stomach cancer, colon

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:90%
cancer, what would you do?

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.410 align:middle line:10%
First of all, I would hope
that my lifestyle gives me

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:10%
that 90% protection, that we can
cut your risk by 90% of getting

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:10%
cancer if you do things right.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.810 align:middle line:90%
However, there's still that 10%.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I would do is,
I'd work with the brightest

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:90%
medical staff that I could.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I'd look for good diagnostics.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
There's reasons for these
diagnostic equipment,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, MRIs, CAT
scans, PET scans,

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
find out how invasive
is the tumor.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.977 align:middle line:84%
Find out how much
time do we have?

00:26:40.977 --> 00:26:43.060 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who,
you better get in there

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and do something
aggressive right now

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
or you could be dead
within hours or days.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I would hope that I
would have some time

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:90%
to look at nontoxic therapies.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Very important for me
is don't burn bridges.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Too often the medical
therapies that

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.410 align:middle line:90%
are used for cancer patients--

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:84%
surgery, to take out 20
lymph nodes in breast cancer.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Now the patient is going to
have lymphodema, swollen lymph

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
in their arm for the
rest of their life, pain.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they need narcotics.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:90%
They've burned a bridge.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.160 align:middle line:90%
Was it necessary?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Radiation therapy.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
You can damage the
esophagus to the point

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
where it's like parchment
paper from radiation.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Was it necessary?

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Using targeted therapy--
so for instance, instead

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:84%
of a whole body radiation, I
might think about using IMRT,

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.100 align:middle line:84%
or intensity modulated
radiation therapy,

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:84%
which is more of a rifle
than a hand grenade.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:84%
But the first
thing I would do is

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:84%
I'd say I'd like to have some
information about why I got it.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
What's the underlying
cause here?

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
very great physicians

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:84%
in this country who
look at etiology.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Toxic burden,
stress, malnutrition.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Take blood samples
and look at what's

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.370 align:middle line:84%
the level of everything
from vitamins and minerals

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.980 align:middle line:90%
to what's the pH of your body.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Look at saliva samples, fecal
samples looking for parasites.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So an aggressive look at
etiology, what caused this?

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And a second aggressive
look at what's

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
the stage, how invasive
and aggressive is it?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And from that,
make some decisions

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that hopefully would
lean towards relatively

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:90%
nontoxic therapies.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:84%
For instance, intravenous
vitamin C helps many,

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:90%
hurts none.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Infrared therapy, far
infrared, cooking the cancer.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Fever therapy.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.720 align:middle line:90%
Helps some, hurts none.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:84%
So I always look at a risk
benefit to cost ratio,

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.910 align:middle line:84%
saying I don't want
to do any damage.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
That's-- premier non nocere
is what Hippocrates said,

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and the oath that all physicians
give is first, do no harm.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:52.510 align:middle line:84%
I would look at IV vitamin C,
hyperthermia, I would look at--

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.300 align:middle line:84%
there are some relatively
nontoxic therapies

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.820 align:middle line:84%
to modulate blood
glucose, lower blood

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.100 align:middle line:84%
glucose to try and
starve the tumor.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.600 align:middle line:84%
There are some herbs that
are extremely powerful.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned everything
from this modified citrus

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.500 align:middle line:84%
pectin to there's
an extract that

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.550 align:middle line:84%
is a fermented
version of wheat germ.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Not to mention too
many names, but there

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.700 align:middle line:84%
is a pharmacy-- there
is a list of therapies

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.630 align:middle line:84%
that are effective, clinically
proven, relatively nontoxic,

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:90%
and relatively inexpensive.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.399 align:middle line:84%
You think about treating
a cancer patient,

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
one year is going to cost
about a quarter of a million,

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:90%
average.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.410 align:middle line:84%
There are cheaper, more
effective, more humane

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and scientific ways of
doing cancer treatment.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Doctor comes to you and
says, Robert Scott Bell,

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
your last bloodwork shows
that you have lung cancer.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'm going
to nebulize silver.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.594 align:middle line:10%
Silver has shown to have
profound oncolytic properties.

00:29:51.594 --> 00:29:52.760 align:middle line:90%
This is something we can do.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.467 align:middle line:84%
We talk about a pH
issue, sometimes.

00:29:55.467 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've covered the use

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:90%
of baking soda in this way.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.960 align:middle line:84%
You can actually do a
lavage within the lungs

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.070 align:middle line:84%
to nebulize that into
certain tissue of the lungs.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a more difficult to do.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.910 align:middle line:84%
But the silver
alone is profound,

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.940 align:middle line:84%
because the cancer cells don't
have any antioxidant defense

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.390 align:middle line:84%
mechanism, and the silver brings
with it as much as 10 times its

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
atomic weight, in with
every particle of silver--

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.730 align:middle line:84%
at a micro level, we're
talking a nano scale level--

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and you can overwhelm
and devastate

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.810 align:middle line:84%
cancer cells in that
area within the alveoli

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.270 align:middle line:84%
if you can inhale that
deeply into your lungs.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what
nebulized means.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, to take a liquid
into a vaporous state for safe

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:90%
inhalation.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And so this is one of the
most profound, most radical,

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and direct ways you
can neutralize cancer

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.470 align:middle line:84%
within the lungs, and most
people don't know about it.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Any other steps that you
might take at that point?

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.354 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, connective
tissue integrity.

00:30:43.354 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:84%
We'd come back to
silica, we'd come back

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:48.740 align:middle line:84%
to metabolic sufficiency,
meaning selenium and chromium

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.690 align:middle line:84%
in the same ways
we talk about it.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I would do homeopathic
medicines that directly

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:54.770 align:middle line:90%
impact on lung tissue.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And even sarcodes, homeopathic
dilutions of cancerous tissue,

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.760 align:middle line:84%
cancerous cells from
the lungs themselves.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And that also mobilizes
the immune system

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.970 align:middle line:84%
to attack and hold and
check those cancer cells.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's a number of
factors, number of things

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:90%
that you can do in that case.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Craichy, last question.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.850 align:middle line:84%
If you were diagnosed
with prostate cancer,

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.500 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's a scary
thought for anyone.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:24.840 align:middle line:10%
Because people, when they hear
about it directed at them,

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:10%
OK, is a very scary thing.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So if it were directed
at me, first of all,

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.920 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
that cancer,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:84%
the diagnosis oftentimes
is made on a test

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:84%
like prostate
specific antigen that

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
really has no bearing on
whether it's real or not.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So if I were ever
diagnosed with that,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I would say, doctor, thank
you for your medical opinion,

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:50.090 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to go
find out the truth.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so first of all, is
it really prostate cancer?

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:90%
Because that is really--

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.060 align:middle line:84%
it's a big question, because
it's not been answered.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So do I have inflammatory
markers that look like that?

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.424 align:middle line:90%
Is the PSA out of whack?

00:32:01.424 --> 00:32:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Are there other things that
look like-- because I will not

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:90%
rush to a biopsy.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Because we think about it, the
biopsy goes through the anus

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.200 align:middle line:90%
to the prostate.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And the chance of
getting infection

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
as a result of just
doing that test

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:21.270 align:middle line:90%
is a very real possibility.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:84%
So there are other scans
like thermal scans and things

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.663 align:middle line:84%
like that, where you can
get a thermal scan to see

00:32:25.663 --> 00:32:29.250 align:middle line:84%
if the heat produced there
is indicative of disease

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:30.462 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:32:30.462 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And I have these
seven things which

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.276 align:middle line:90%
I advise people all the time.

00:32:33.276 --> 00:32:34.650 align:middle line:84%
People call me
and say, I've just

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.316 align:middle line:84%
been diagnosed with
this kind of cancer.

00:32:36.316 --> 00:32:37.470 align:middle line:90%
What should I do?

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And I will go
through these seven,

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and it goes through
something like this.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:48.400 align:middle line:84%
That first of all, stop all
sugar and starch carbohydrates.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I say if it's a carbohydrate,
if it's white it ain't right.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So the net of it is, OK,
first stop feeding the problem

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and whacking your immunity
like we've talked about.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's a double edged sword.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a terrible thing.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So get your vegetables
and eat tons of them.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Vegetables, primarily, fruits
not so much, but vegetables,

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:09.690 align:middle line:90%
eat a lot of fibrous vegetables.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
get a carbohydrate,

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:84%
it should come from
a fibrous vegetable.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And then follow the four
corners of superfood nutrition

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.480 align:middle line:90%
I talked about.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Get all the nutrient
that your body needs,

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and get the four corners.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Low calorie, nutrient
dense, high broad spectrum

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:84%
antioxidant, taking in all
five classes of antioxidants,

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.530 align:middle line:84%
as I talked about
reducing the sugar

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:29.988 align:middle line:84%
and the glycemic
response, and then

00:33:29.988 --> 00:33:33.450 align:middle line:84%
increasing the healthy
fats, the fish oil fats.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Now again, I go to
antioxidant fish oil

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.120 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of people
out there touting

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.720 align:middle line:84%
shellfish oils like krill oil
or green lipped mussel oil,

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's still
omega 3, and so it

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:84%
does have omega 3
benefit, but the touting

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:84%
of that instead of fish
oil is not appropriate

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
according to the literature,
the way I have reviewed it.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, you can get
benefit from those things,

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:84%
but you talk about these krill
oil has a lot of astaxanthin

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.684 align:middle line:84%
in it, therefore it can
keep it from spoiling--

00:34:03.684 --> 00:34:05.100 align:middle line:84%
some of the things
we talked about

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and keeping the
oils from spoiling.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But when I looked at how
much astaxanthin was actually

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:14.920 align:middle line:84%
in a krill pill, it was so
minute it was unbelievable.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So you want to try to get
one milligram of astaxanthin,

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.020 align:middle line:84%
in addition to all
the tocotrienol

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.374 align:middle line:84%
and so on, to get the fish oils,
but that's really important.

00:34:22.374 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:84%
We talked about--
all these things

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about already
are reducing inflammation

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and reducing glycation and
oxidation and angiogenesis.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.949 align:middle line:84%
So I personally would
go on a fuel fast.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I would have living fuel for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:84%
until I decided what
path I was going

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.880 align:middle line:84%
to take to deal
with this diagnosis,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:90%
or whether it was real or not.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And then things
like resveratrol.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:48.606 align:middle line:84%
It's a very powerful
antioxidant.

00:34:48.606 --> 00:34:50.730 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the ones that
you ought to be taking.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:90%
And then curcumin.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Curcumin has been shown
to be so anticancer.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.384 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
research on that now.

00:34:56.384 --> 00:34:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And recently a doctor sent me
a photo, which I showed you,

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.320 align:middle line:84%
about this squamal
cell carcinoma

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.410 align:middle line:84%
on the lip of this
patient was just terrible,

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and he put this paste with
curcumin and coconut oil,

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.379 align:middle line:90%
and in two weeks it was gone.

00:35:09.379 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what the
biopsies looked like in that,

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.550 align:middle line:84%
but the point is just this,
is that nutrition is powerful.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.170 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinarily powerful.

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you start pointing
it in the right direction

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and doing some of things
that the research suggests,

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.430 align:middle line:90%
it has to be good for you.

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that's
critically important

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.240 align:middle line:90%
is vitamin D, vitamin D levels.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:90%
I would say--

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.512 align:middle line:84%
I would make sure that--
mine already are--

00:35:30.512 --> 00:35:32.970 align:middle line:84%
but if I was in that particular
situation I would make sure

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that my vitamin D, 25
hydroxy vitamin D level

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:39.454 align:middle line:84%
was in the 70 to
90 range in a test.

00:35:39.454 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
first tests I would get.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I would get you know
all the tests, including

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:84%
the inflammatory
markers and so on,

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.760 align:middle line:84%
but I would get a
vitamin D3 test,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:84%
or vitamin D 25 hydroxy vitamin
D test to see where it is.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Because vitamin D is the
immune modulator of the body.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.310 align:middle line:84%
So having your vitamin D
levels at the right level

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.235 align:middle line:84%
is imperative in
this particular case.

00:35:58.235 --> 00:35:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And then another
thing I would do

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.010 align:middle line:84%
is I would take significant
amounts of vitamin A,

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:04.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's also
an immune enhancer,

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and then there's some
well-known mushroom extracts

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:90%
that enhance immunity too.

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:10.769 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm saying this
is not a treatment

00:36:10.769 --> 00:36:12.060 align:middle line:90%
protocol I'm giving to anybody.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this is what I
tell people, do these things

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:84%
while you're figuring out what
it is that you're going to do.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Because see, this
business called medicine,

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.450 align:middle line:84%
or business called cancer
care, it does a lot of fear

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.410 align:middle line:90%
to patients.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.550 align:middle line:90%
You have this problem.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:29.990 align:middle line:90%
We need to deal with it now.

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
that it most likely

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.860 align:middle line:90%
is not that level of emergency.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Now it can be, but
most likely, you

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.620 align:middle line:84%
have some time to get a second
opinion, to get your bearings,

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.190 align:middle line:84%
get your brain working,
and go to somebody

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.859 align:middle line:84%
like Ralph Moss or somebody
else and buy a report--

00:36:46.859 --> 00:36:49.400 align:middle line:84%
because he has a great report,
which I always send people to,

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to get this report--
it tells you

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:56.150 align:middle line:84%
what are the types of care
used for that particular kind

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
of cancer out there,
and what are the success

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.210 align:middle line:84%
rates of the
various ones and who

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.275 align:middle line:84%
are the practitioners
that are doing it

00:37:00.275 --> 00:37:01.670 align:middle line:90%
and what are the alternatives.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:84%
That kind of information
is incredibly powerful,

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.379 align:middle line:84%
because it's put in a way
that you can literally

00:37:05.379 --> 00:37:08.149 align:middle line:84%
hand that to the doctor, and
it is scientific documentation.

00:37:08.149 --> 00:37:10.440 align:middle line:84%
They have to go, oh, yeah,
I guess it does makes sense.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.260 align:middle line:84%
A d if your doctor
refuses to work with you

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.343 align:middle line:84%
or tells you that you
should not take antioxidants

00:37:14.343 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
during cancer care,
you might want

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to consider a different doctor
because the literature is not

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.940 align:middle line:90%
backing that up.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you please share
with us your own breast cancer

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.620 align:middle line:90%
conqueror story?

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, fast forward.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:10%
I've been in practice 24
years, and typical morning,

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.030 align:middle line:10%
rushing to the office,
jump in the shower,

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:34.820 align:middle line:10%
and I felt a lump
on my left breast.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And I knew innately, at that
point, it wasn't fibrocystic.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.820 align:middle line:90%
It was an unhealthy lump.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So I had it diagnosed with
unconventional methods,

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and it was diagnosed
as breast cancer.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I had seen in my
practice that patients

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:84%
who chose traditional
methods of cut, poison, burn

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.110 align:middle line:90%
didn't fare well at all.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they suffered so
much from the side effects

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.050 align:middle line:84%
of those treatments,
and many of them

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:05.570 align:middle line:84%
died as a result
of the treatments,

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.460 align:middle line:90%
not so much the cancer.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And on the flip
side, I saw patients

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.800 align:middle line:84%
who were using gentler
methods of healing,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.780 align:middle line:84%
following the anti-cancer
protocols that I

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.009 align:middle line:84%
was recommending, and they
were getting amazing results.

00:38:18.009 --> 00:38:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So there was no doubt in my
mind what I was going to do

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.320 align:middle line:84%
and which path I
was going to follow.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So my protocol consisted of
specific homeopathic remedies,

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.660 align:middle line:84%
herbal tinctures to
weaken the cancer,

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:84%
to boost the immune system,
proteolytic enzymes,

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.910 align:middle line:84%
some dietary changes, some
detoxification, colonics,

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:90%
those sorts of things.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And I also used a
paste or a salve

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.060 align:middle line:84%
on my breast to help the
body expel the tumor.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:51.050 align:middle line:84%
In the paste there is an
herb called bloodroot.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And bloodroot has an
alkaloid or a plant compound

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:55.910 align:middle line:90%
called sanguinarine.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And that particular compound
goes after cancer cells

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and kills cancer cells without
touching healthy tissue

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:90%
or healthy cells.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually take
bloodroot internally

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.140 align:middle line:84%
or you can apply
it superficially

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:13.250 align:middle line:84%
to very superficial tumors like
skin cancers and breast cancers

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.730 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So my journey lasted
from 2004 through 2006

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and I've been happy
and healthy ever since.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But as I was going
through that journey,

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:27.310 align:middle line:84%
there was one thing that
was gnawing in my gut.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:84%
It was why would somebody
like me develop breast cancer?

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.330 align:middle line:90%
I had done everything right.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I was under chiropractic care.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.890 align:middle line:84%
I was eating organic before
organic was in style.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I had home births,
breasted all my children,

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.270 align:middle line:84%
massage, I exercised,
I ate well.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was doing
everything right.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But as I started studying
more and researching more,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.630 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there were some
components that I was missing.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led me to
create what I call the seven

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.750 align:middle line:84%
essentials, or
seven basic steps,

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:04.790 align:middle line:84%
that if people follow they
never have to fear cancer again.

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us a little bit about
the seven essentials, then.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, seven essentials.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Seven basic steps.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:14.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the complaints
that I hear from people

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.926 align:middle line:84%
is that they're confused,
they're frustrated,

00:40:16.926 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're overwhelmed because
they don't know where to start.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.091 align:middle line:84%
Who do they believe and what do
they believe on the internet?

00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so
much information.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can relate
to that because I

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.400 align:middle line:84%
had some of that overwhelmed
feeling at times.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.710 align:middle line:90%
So I created seven basic steps.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Now essential number one is
let food be your medicine.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Hippocrates, founder
of modern medicine,

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.600 align:middle line:84%
he looked at food as a
prescription for our health.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
should do as well.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Essential number two is to
reduce your toxic exposure.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.140 align:middle line:84%
We live in extremely
toxic world,

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.050 align:middle line:84%
from a macro to a micro
level, so it's very important

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.510 align:middle line:84%
to learn to reduce that
as much as you can.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Essential number three is
to balance your energy.

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.060 align:middle line:84%
We are electrical beings
and we run on energy.

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
to balance that energy

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:84%
through chiropractic care,
through acupuncture, massage,

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.030 align:middle line:84%
exercise, proper
sleep, all these things

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.400 align:middle line:90%
keep your body in balance.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Number four is to look
at the emotional wounds,

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:90%
heal the emotional wounds.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that a lot of people

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.844 align:middle line:90%
kind of like to skim over.

00:41:22.844 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to think about
the hurts and the childhood

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.100 align:middle line:90%
wounds.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But unless you heal
those past relationships,

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.600 align:middle line:84%
you learn to love yourself,
you connect with your creator,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.060 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
truly heal the body.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Because healing is
not just physical,

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.940 align:middle line:84%
but it's also emotional
and spiritual as well.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.450 align:middle line:84%
Essential number five is to
embrace biological dentistry.

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Look at what's in your mouth.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that the metals
in your mouth, the root canals,

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.940 align:middle line:84%
can affect your
body from a chemical

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.910 align:middle line:84%
point of view by the toxins
that they're giving off,

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.220 align:middle line:84%
but also from an
energetic point of view.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:03.660 align:middle line:84%
If there's a root canal or a
heavy metal in a tooth that

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to a specific
organ, that, in time,

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.540 align:middle line:84%
is going to weaken that
organ because the acupuncture

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.360 align:middle line:84%
meridian system is
being compromised there.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So biological
dentistry, extremely

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.140 align:middle line:90%
important for true health.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And then number six
is to repair your body

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:90%
with therapeutic plants.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.920 align:middle line:84%
There are literally thousands
of published studies,

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.000 align:middle line:84%
as you know, that prove the
power of natural medicine.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's everything from
every herb, every type of food

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that has shown the benefits
of boosting the immune system

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and weakening the cancer
and preventing cancer.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So learning about those
plants and those supplements

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.250 align:middle line:84%
are extremely important
for a healing journey.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, number
seven is early detection

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:48.330 align:middle line:84%
through thermography and
through specific bloodwork.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Now thermography is
a technology that

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:54.960 align:middle line:84%
reads the infrared heat that's
coming off the body so it

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.900 align:middle line:84%
can detect physiological
changes happening

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.670 align:middle line:90%
at a very early stage.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:84%
We can't say that
it diagnoses cancer,

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.150 align:middle line:84%
but it can detect some
changes on a cellular level.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:10.590 align:middle line:84%
By the time a person finds
a lump or bump in cancer,

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.810 align:middle line:84%
that tumor has been there
five to eight years.

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It takes that long for cancer
to develop and show up.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
specific bloodwork

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:84%
that most people
don't know about.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Traditional medicine doesn't use
them, doesn't recommend them.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.910 align:middle line:84%
But there are ways to measure
hormone production and enzyme

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:30.180 align:middle line:84%
production of cancer cells
at a very early stage,

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.810 align:middle line:84%
again, years before they
develop and years before they're

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:36.120 align:middle line:90%
seen on a regular blood test.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So those are itm seven
essentials, one through seven.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Follow those things
and you never

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
have to fear cancer again,
or any type of disease,

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.138 align:middle line:90%
for that matter.

00:43:45.138 --> 00:43:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So AJ, let me
ask you a question.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:84%
If you were personally diagnosed
with, say, prostate cancer

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:54.000 align:middle line:84%
like your grandfather had, what
would be the steps that you

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:90%
would take to treat it?

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:02.220 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, I've been asked
that question many times.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.830 align:middle line:10%
You know who William
Donald Kelley is?

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:10.410 align:middle line:10%
I am a tremendous believer
in what he has done.

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Not only because of what
I've read in his book,

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.110 align:middle line:84%
but I've probably,
over the years,

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.410 align:middle line:90%
met close to 100 survivors.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about not three
year survivors, five year--

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about 10, 15,
20-plus year survivors.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.130 align:middle line:84%
One of my closest friends, Dr.
John L. Tate up in Spartanburg,

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:34.380 align:middle line:84%
South Carolina, he's
a 40-plus year cancer

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.960 align:middle line:90%
survivor from prostate cancer.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I've met women
with breast cancer.

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I actually met
somebody, a 15-plus year

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:46.440 align:middle line:90%
survivor of pancreatic cancer.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.240 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>> 15 years?

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And to me, anecdotals,
if that's all you've got,

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:03.360 align:middle line:84%
if all you've got is,
well, Johnny was sick,

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Johnny showed up,
Johnny get these pills,

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.660 align:middle line:84%
now Johnny's better, that's
what I talk about an anecdotal.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
the medical records,

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.430 align:middle line:84%
you got the pictures
of the tumors,

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:23.720 align:middle line:84%
you've got befores
and afters in spades,

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.430 align:middle line:84%
as a doctor told me
one time, Mr. Lanigan,

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.380 align:middle line:90%
you can't argue with results.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.110 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to explain it.

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.330 align:middle line:90%
I see the pictures.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm inclined not to
believe one doctor who

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:38.040 align:middle line:84%
told me one time, well,
you know, cancer sometimes

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.440 align:middle line:90%
cures itself.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.210 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And after 15, 16, 17 years
in enhancing immune system

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:51.570 align:middle line:84%
using beta glucan, I've
seen tumors disappear.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:56.180 align:middle line:90%
I've seen doctors in amazement.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Are these the right records?

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.940 align:middle line:90%
Is this my patient?

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because this can't be,
because we haven't treated you

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.260 align:middle line:90%
get with chemo and radiation.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Your cancer can't
be getting better.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Your cancer can't be gone.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:84%
People who have
embraced certain diets--

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.830 align:middle line:84%
coffee enema's one
of my favorites.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:21.220 align:middle line:84%
As Dr. Tate used to always
tell me, that coffee's good,

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.255 align:middle line:84%
but you're putting
it in the wrong end.

00:46:23.255 --> 00:46:25.100 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.630 align:middle line:84%
I actually tried a
few coffee enemas.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest with you.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably enjoy
being in a fistfight.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.825 align:middle line:84%
But if I get cancer,
I'd figure out a way.

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If you could, tell us a
little bit about your personal

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.000 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.780 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned prostate cancer.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.080 align:middle line:84%
What did you do to
treat your own cancer?

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So I have been vigilant about
prostate cancer because my dad

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.059 align:middle line:90%
had prostate cancer.

00:46:48.059 --> 00:46:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And I saw what he went through.

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:55.060 align:middle line:84%
So he had the prostatectomy
and I saw the results of that.

00:46:55.060 --> 00:47:00.000 align:middle line:10%
So I started being
vigilant about my PSA,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:10%
as most men should,
probably in my 40s, mid-40s.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.950 align:middle line:10%
And so I would go
every year and have

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:12.390 align:middle line:10%
a digital rectal exam, again,
as all men should, and a PSA.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:17.970 align:middle line:84%
At around age 49, I think, I
saw my PSA go from one point

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:20.400 align:middle line:84%
something up to three
point something, which

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.210 align:middle line:84%
was a rather dramatic
increase and got my attention.

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:28.299 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't do
anything initially,

00:47:28.299 --> 00:47:30.840 align:middle line:84%
but then when I went the next
year, they had gone up to four.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And four is kind of a cutoff
point in conventional medicine

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:37.440 align:middle line:84%
for when you need to do
something, so kind of what

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.460 align:middle line:90%
I now call the boiling point.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So in medicine, we
treat boiling points.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you
this little analogy

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:49.590 align:middle line:84%
that if you were to
take a pot of cold water

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:55.500 align:middle line:84%
and put it on the stove and
then stick your hand in it,

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and then turn the heat
on high, at some point

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.090 align:middle line:84%
you would take your
hand out of that water,

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:02.550 align:middle line:90%
because it's getting so hot.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.370 align:middle line:84%
That may be 130 degrees, it
may be 140 degrees, depending

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.522 align:middle line:90%
on your pain tolerance.

00:48:07.522 --> 00:48:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Once you take your
hand out of that water

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and it stays on there, once
it gets to 212 degrees, right,

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:17.250 align:middle line:84%
if we're talking about
solute-free water at sea level,

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.430 align:middle line:84%
then at 212 degrees
it's going to boil.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Now if you stick your hand
in that water at 212 degrees,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.550 align:middle line:90%
you're going to get burned.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:30.480 align:middle line:84%
If you stick your hand
in there at 211 degrees,

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.160 align:middle line:90%
it's going to burn.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.590 align:middle line:90%
210, or 200.

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a good idea to
wait till the boiling point,

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.770 align:middle line:84%
right, to make that an
actionable time for you

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:42.600 align:middle line:90%
to try to intervene.

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we do in
conventional medicine.

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So that water's getting
hotter and hotter and hotter

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:52.740 align:middle line:84%
and hotter here, and your
A1C gets up to 5.7 or six

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.510 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the number is,
and that's the boiling point.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Now all of a sudden
you have diabetes.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Now let's say your
hemoglobin A1C at six.

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:03.707 align:middle line:90%
Well, where were you at 5.9?

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.790 align:middle line:84%
You weren't boiling, but
you were still hot enough

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.890 align:middle line:90%
that you're getting burnt.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with
high blood pressure.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So with the PSA the
boiling point is four.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So that's when they say you need
to get a biopsy or whatever.

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, what was it at 3.9?

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:22.690 align:middle line:84%
We should be looking
or investigating

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.930 align:middle line:84%
why PSAs are elevating when
they get anything above two.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So above two you've either
got some type of infection

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.910 align:middle line:84%
or you got cancer, if
you haven't had trauma

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:34.690 align:middle line:90%
or some of these other things.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I got up to
four, I approached a--

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:40.680 align:middle line:84%
actually, one of my
instructors here.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.887 align:middle line:84%
I've lived here and I went
to medical school here,

00:49:42.887 --> 00:49:44.720 align:middle line:84%
finished up medical
school here in Amarillo.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So I know many of the
doctors, and many of them

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.230 align:middle line:84%
had been my teachers
in medical school.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And Mike Wilkerson
is a local urologist

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:55.110 align:middle line:90%
that I had studied under.

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Really good guy.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:90%
So I went to him.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was only 50 years
old and very good looking--

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:07.137 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to believe looking
at me that I've got cancer.

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't believe that I had
cancer and told me most likely

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.845 align:middle line:84%
this was an infection,
let's takes some antibiotics

00:50:11.845 --> 00:50:13.650 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll check it again.

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I went with his
recommendation and we did that,

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.290 align:middle line:90%
and the number went up.

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I was, Mike, I think
it's time for us to do a biopsy.

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:27.360 align:middle line:90%
He agreed.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And there was cancer.

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And there was-- not just cancer.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
widespread cancer,

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:35.880 align:middle line:84%
as you have seen in
the documentation.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.730 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So I had taken
care of my mother.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:84%
She had been diagnosed with
colon cancer back in 2000.

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And we did the natural immune
boosting therapies on her.

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:51.870 align:middle line:84%
They had given her
six months to live

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:54.760 align:middle line:90%
and she lived for six years.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I started doing the
same thing with myself.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.670 align:middle line:84%
At this time I was
heading on my way,

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:02.160 align:middle line:84%
actually, up to be with
Dr. Jonathan Wright

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:06.660 align:middle line:84%
to work with him in the clinic
up there in Renton, Washington.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:10.422 align:middle line:10%
And so he and I put
our heads together,

00:51:10.422 --> 00:51:11.880 align:middle line:10%
were able to put
our heads together

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:16.950 align:middle line:10%
and to start to do some
things in order to one,

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:19.980 align:middle line:10%
boost up the immune system,
two, maybe to kill off

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:23.460 align:middle line:10%
some of the cells, because
there will be some cells that

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.590 align:middle line:10%
refuse to change.

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
doing those things.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:34.240 align:middle line:90%
And made the numbers come down.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.970 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
we did out there--

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I was able to do it out there
because of the laws out there.

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Medical marijuana is legal, so
we did the medical marijuana,

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:49.410 align:middle line:84%
we did high dose vitamin D, we
did this immune therapy called

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.990 align:middle line:90%
universal oral vaccine.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the diet
was very important.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So the juicing and away from
any kind of grains, sugars,

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:00.397 align:middle line:90%
and that type of thing.

00:52:00.397 --> 00:52:03.600 align:middle line:90%


00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had symptoms
that let me know

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that my cancer had
progressed, so I

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:10.020 align:middle line:90%
saw those symptoms reversed.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But it really had gotten
up to a point where

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I had said my
goodbyes to everybody

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and let people know
that this is-- you know,

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.910 align:middle line:84%
we're in a kind of a
no-win situation here.

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:24.955 align:middle line:84%
But then things turned around,
and long story short, I

00:52:24.955 --> 00:52:28.881 align:middle line:84%
went and had a repeat PET scan
here back in, I guess, November

00:52:28.881 --> 00:52:30.630 align:middle line:84%
that we'll be able to
get a shot of, also,

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:33.520 align:middle line:90%
that again, showed no cancer.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So I've done this with person
after person after person,

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.650 align:middle line:84%
if they are willing
to do what it takes

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:44.580 align:middle line:90%
to get off this toxic diet.

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:47.420 align:middle line:84%
That's usually the stumbling
block for a lot of people,

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.920 align:middle line:84%
they're just so addicted
to the sugar and the wheat

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:51.720 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.190 align:middle line:90%
They just can't get off of it.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:57.270 align:middle line:84%
But when people do, we
certainly do see, again,

00:52:57.270 --> 00:53:01.710 align:middle line:84%
a reversal of this pleomorphism,
and cancer is not there

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:02.640 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the cells
are still there,

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:05.790 align:middle line:84%
but they have just chosen
that they don't need

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:08.301 align:middle line:90%
to be cancer cells anymore.

00:53:08.301 --> 00:53:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my first patients
is a wonderful lady.

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.350 align:middle line:90%
She lives in New Jersey.

00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:12.020 align:middle line:90%
She came to me--

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget this--

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.100 align:middle line:90%
December 3, 1987.

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.180 align:middle line:84%
She's so memorable,
I remember the day.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd only been in
practice a couple months.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
She had stage 4 breast cancer,
a very interesting story.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.730 align:middle line:84%
In 1985 she develops a
mass in her right breast.

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Breast turns red.

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:27.270 align:middle line:84%
The doctor thinks it's mastitis,
which is an infected breast,

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.830 align:middle line:90%
puts her on antibiotics.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:29.732 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't get better.

00:53:29.732 --> 00:53:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Puts her on more antibiotics.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't get better.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.960 align:middle line:84%
The breast gets bigger,
redder, looks nasty.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.910 align:middle line:10%
So he sends her to a
surgeon, biopsies it,

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.650 align:middle line:10%
comes back, inflammatory
breast cancer.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.920 align:middle line:10%
As physicians know,
inflammatory breast cancer

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.170 align:middle line:10%
is the most aggressive type
of breast cancer there is.

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:45.930 align:middle line:84%
It's virtually incurable
by standard approaches.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:47.430 align:middle line:84%
It was huge at
that point, so big

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that when she was sent to the
surgeon for surgery, he says,

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.100 align:middle line:90%
it's too big.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't operate on you.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:52.761 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is
have radiation first

00:53:52.761 --> 00:53:54.090 align:middle line:90%
to shrink it down.

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:56.040 align:middle line:84%
She goes through five
weeks of radiation.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The tumor shrinks down
enough so the surgeon said,

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll try to take it out.

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:00.355 align:middle line:84%
Takes it out, it was
eight centimeters,

00:54:00.355 --> 00:54:02.970 align:middle line:84%
which for breast cancer
after radiation is huge.

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:05.517 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly
17 of 17 lymph nodes

00:54:05.517 --> 00:54:06.600 align:middle line:90%
were involved with cancer.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.225 align:middle line:84%
All the lymph nodes
that were evaluated

00:54:08.225 --> 00:54:10.140 align:middle line:84%
had cancer, which
is a dire prognosis.

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:12.160 align:middle line:84%
The way it works in
cancer medicine, whenever

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.740 align:middle line:84%
you have more than
nine lymph nodes

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.330 align:middle line:90%
involved, it's a death sentence.

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.980 align:middle line:84%
They did a bone scan, but
they didn't see anything

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:17.570 align:middle line:90%
in the bone.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:19.800 align:middle line:84%
But when you have 17 out
of 17 lymph nodes positive,

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.200 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with
deadly disease.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Her oncologist
decides that they're

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:26.510 align:middle line:84%
going to get her aggressive
chemotherapy, triple agent

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:27.600 align:middle line:90%
regiment, very aggressive.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.890 align:middle line:84%
In those days, it
was the standard

00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:29.848 align:middle line:90%
for metastatic disease.

00:54:29.848 --> 00:54:33.020 align:middle line:84%
CMF-- cytoxan, methotrexate,
5-fluorouracil-- the three

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:33.820 align:middle line:90%
drugs.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:35.580 align:middle line:90%
It was developed in Italy.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.260 align:middle line:84%
They tell her that
this won't cure her,

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:38.700 align:middle line:90%
but it might prolong her life.

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.350 align:middle line:90%
So she starts doing it.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Two years into it,
August 1987, she

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.640 align:middle line:90%
develops pain in the sternum.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.490 align:middle line:90%
They do a bone scan.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:47.160 align:middle line:84%
She's got multiple
lesions in her ribs

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.250 align:middle line:84%
consistent with
metastatic disease.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:49.749 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge tumor
in her sternum.

00:54:49.749 --> 00:54:51.940 align:middle line:84%
They do an X-ray,
confirms the tumor.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:84%
The guy, the
oncologist, honest guy,

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.330 align:middle line:84%
throws his hands in the
air, nothing else we can do.

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd only been in
practice two months.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I had this kind
of international reputation.

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you know, as
well known as dog poop.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.714 align:middle line:90%
No one knew who I was.

00:55:05.714 --> 00:55:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be on
the Bob Atkins Show.

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.592 align:middle line:84%
Bob Atkins is an old friend
from my journalism days.

00:55:09.592 --> 00:55:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I've included in a
couple of my articles.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.480 align:middle line:90%
So we remain personal friends.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.231 align:middle line:84%
He had a very well
listened to national radio

00:55:16.231 --> 00:55:17.230 align:middle line:90%
show back in those days.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.604 align:middle line:84%
And he knew about
my Kelly study.

00:55:18.604 --> 00:55:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd given him a copy, which
I couldn't get published.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:22.840 align:middle line:90%
And he had me on his show.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.367 align:middle line:84%
And this patient's
social worker that she

00:55:25.367 --> 00:55:27.950 align:middle line:84%
was consulting with, because of
the stress of cancer, happened

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to have an interest in
alternative med-- she actually,

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.280 align:middle line:84%
ironically, she worked for
the American Cancer Society.

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:34.530 align:middle line:84%
She kept her interest in
alternative medicine secret.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:35.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like pornography.

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.710 align:middle line:90%
You have to keep it secret.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:40.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to hide it because
they might do something.

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:41.877 align:middle line:84%
She might lose her
job, end up in jail.

00:55:41.877 --> 00:55:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So she had a secret interest in
alternative medicine, heard me

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:84%
on the show, and she
tells the patient,

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.420 align:middle line:90%
you got to see Gonzales.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'd only been
in practice two months,

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:51.575 align:middle line:84%
there was something
in the radio show--

00:55:51.575 --> 00:55:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and Bob gave me like an hour--

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.410 align:middle line:84%
that resonated with
the social worker.

00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And the patients believed
what the social worker said,

00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:58.590 align:middle line:90%
came to see me.

00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Now it's interesting, 1987,
been in practice two months.

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Why would anyone
trust me when you're

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:03.776 align:middle line:90%
dealing with stage 4 cancer?

00:56:03.776 --> 00:56:04.760 align:middle line:90%
But she did.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And we learned
often the difference

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:10.450 align:middle line:84%
between success and failure is
the attitude of the patient.

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:12.840 align:middle line:84%
We treat people biochemically,
and my goal in life,

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.860 align:middle line:84%
once I adopted science
as my new lifestyle,

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.550 align:middle line:84%
was to spend my life
at Sloan-Kettering

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:18.900 align:middle line:90%
doing basic science research.

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I never even thought
I'd see patients.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:21.670 align:middle line:90%
But I've learned.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I had to change that.

00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot of
this from Kelley

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:25.688 align:middle line:84%
that the attitude and
the mind of the patient's

00:56:25.688 --> 00:56:27.400 align:middle line:84%
the single most
important determinants.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Patients that are at peace
with their situation,

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.030 align:middle line:84%
have faith in the practitioner
always do the best.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:34.571 align:middle line:84%
I always tell patients, if you
don't trust your practitioner,

00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:37.500 align:middle line:84%
whether it's me, Joe Schmoe down
the street, Sloan-Kettering,

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:37.860 align:middle line:90%
leave.

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Find someone you believe in.

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Because your lack
of belief, your lack

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:41.760 align:middle line:84%
of faith, your lack of
trust will undermine

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.051 align:middle line:90%
your treatment, whatever it is.

00:56:43.051 --> 00:56:44.584 align:middle line:90%
Chemo, radiation, [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:44.584 --> 00:56:46.750 align:middle line:84%
She trusted me from the
beginning, did the program--

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:47.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why she did.

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:49.860 align:middle line:84%
There was something that
resonated, we got along great.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Did the program, didn't want
scans, said, what's the point?

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:55.080 align:middle line:84%
They told me I'm going to
be dead, so why do scans?

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.538 align:middle line:84%
Why expose myself
to the radiation?

00:56:56.538 --> 00:56:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Even back in the 1980s she
was thinking like that.

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Finally, 2001, 14
years later, I said,

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:03.820 align:middle line:84%
look, I'm trained
as an academician.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.430 align:middle line:90%
Humor me, do a bone scan.

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:06.720 align:middle line:90%
We won't do CAT scans, OK.

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you
getting radiation.

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Let me do a bone scan.

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:10.560 align:middle line:84%
She did, all the
tumors were gone.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And she's alive
and well now, it's

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.270 align:middle line:84%
26 and a half years
since her diagnosis

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:18.240 align:middle line:84%
with stage 4 metastatic
inflammatory breast cancer,

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.490 align:middle line:84%
developing metastases while
on aggressive chemotherapy

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.840 align:middle line:84%
with total regression of
disease on my treatment,

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.280 align:middle line:90%
26 and a half years out.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.682 align:middle line:84%
I'm trained as, you know,
having been a journalist,

00:57:27.682 --> 00:57:29.890 align:middle line:84%
it's so funny, it's like a
different personality now.

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm obsessed with the
conventional medical

00:57:31.590 --> 00:57:32.030 align:middle line:90%
literature.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Friday evenings I'm
reading medical literature.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.576 align:middle line:84%
And I study the literature
because it helps me

00:57:35.576 --> 00:57:36.510 align:middle line:90%
in my own work.

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:39.370 align:middle line:84%
I know of no case in history
of medicine, 26 and a half year

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:41.430 align:middle line:84%
survivor of metastatic
inflammatory breast

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:44.477 align:middle line:84%
cancer into the bone, developing
metastases while on chemo

00:57:44.477 --> 00:57:46.560 align:middle line:84%
who had total regression
on a nutritional program.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't know of any other case.

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the name of your
2010 book that you finally,

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.650 align:middle line:90%
I guess, got published?

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> "One Man Alone, an
investigation of nutrition,

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.392 align:middle line:84%
cancer, and William
Donald Kelley".

00:57:57.392 --> 00:57:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And in there we have
the 50 case reports.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Now initially, the patients
actually gave us permission

00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.870 align:middle line:84%
not only to use their medical
records but to use their name,

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:05.190 align:middle line:84%
but with the internet, we
don't want these people--

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of them
are still alive.

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:09.135 align:middle line:84%
There's still in 80s,
some of them their 90s.

00:58:09.135 --> 00:58:10.718 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't want
them being harassed,

00:58:10.718 --> 00:58:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and reporters
tracking them down.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.065 align:middle line:84%
So we blanked out their
name, with one exception.

00:58:15.065 --> 00:58:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Arlene, I can use her name,
because she is a good friend.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:19.682 align:middle line:84%
Actually called today, so
I got to give her a call.

00:58:19.682 --> 00:58:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Arlene Van Straten, she was
one of Kelley's great patients.

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:23.770 align:middle line:90%
I now follow her.

00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:27.270 align:middle line:84%
1982, Appleton, Wisconsin,
typical American success story.

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.270 align:middle line:84%
She and her husband ran
a gas station seven days

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:30.853 align:middle line:84%
a week, worked their
tailfeathers off,

00:58:30.853 --> 00:58:32.090 align:middle line:90%
added a store to it.

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:34.580 align:middle line:84%
They were later bought out
by a big chain and became--

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.371 align:middle line:84%
they were able to--
let's put it this way--

00:58:36.371 --> 00:58:38.810 align:middle line:84%
put their kids, their
grandkids through college.

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:40.460 align:middle line:84%
She starts getting
gallbladder pain,

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.410 align:middle line:84%
doctor say you've got
gallbladder problem.

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:44.900 align:middle line:84%
This is 1982 before they
routinely do CAT scans.

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:46.430 align:middle line:84%
They take her to surgery to
take out her gallbladder.

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:47.420 align:middle line:84%
They open her up,
she's got a tumor

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.650 align:middle line:84%
in her pancreas,
tumor in the liver.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:50.360 align:middle line:84%
They biopsy the
liver lesions, it's

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.910 align:middle line:84%
adenocarcinoma,
metastatic pancreatic.

00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Close her up, meets
with an oncologist.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Chemo is going to do nothing.

00:58:56.230 --> 00:59:00.212 align:middle line:84%
This is 1982-- still
does nothing today, 2014.

00:59:00.212 --> 00:59:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Goes to the Mayo
Clinic, and I have

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:middle line:84%
the note from the Mayo
Clinic guy, who said I'm not

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.460 align:middle line:90%
going to give you chemo.

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It'd just ruin your
quality of life.

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy your life.

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:08.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, she went to
the best of the best,

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.700 align:middle line:84%
they said they
can't do anything.

00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Learns about Kelley
from his 32-page book,

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.952 align:middle line:84%
"One Answer to Cancer", 1969,
on a local health food store.

00:59:14.952 --> 00:59:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Reads it, calls Kelley.

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:18.159 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, I've trained
this chiropractor locally,

00:59:18.159 --> 00:59:20.640 align:middle line:84%
trained some people who
does it really well.

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.910 align:middle line:84%
He's near your town, why
don't you go see him?

00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:23.711 align:middle line:90%
She does.

00:59:23.711 --> 00:59:25.751 align:middle line:84%
Under Kelly's direction,
she goes on the program.

00:59:25.751 --> 00:59:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, she never went
back to another doctor.

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:28.580 align:middle line:90%
Never had a scan done.

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fact is, here it is,
2014, she's alive and well.

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly enough,
paradoxically, ironically,

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:33.390 align:middle line:90%
today she calls.

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:34.264 align:middle line:90%
So she wants to chat.

00:59:34.264 --> 00:59:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Usually it's about her family.

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:38.210 align:middle line:84%
She's 32 years out, August
it will be 32 years.

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:40.702 align:middle line:84%
Stage 4 pancreatic cancer,
biopsy proved liver metastases

00:59:40.702 --> 00:59:41.910 align:middle line:90%
confirmed at the Mayo Clinic.

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:44.493 align:middle line:84%
To put it in perspective and to
give Kelley his credit, know--

00:59:44.493 --> 00:59:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and I searched the
literature religiously--

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I know of no patient
history of medicine

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:52.420 align:middle line:84%
with stage 4 pancreatic cancer,
adenocarcinoma, the worst kind,

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.450 align:middle line:84%
biopsy proven liver metastases,
confirmed at the Mayo Clinic--

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:58.000 align:middle line:84%
not some local
hospital in Guatemala,

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.190 align:middle line:90%
but by the Mayo Clinic--

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:00.522 align:middle line:90%
who's alive 32 years later.

01:00:00.522 --> 01:00:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Never found a case like that.

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I challenge doctors
at conferences

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:05.359 align:middle line:84%
when I lecture to match it
and they've been unable to.

01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> 32 years.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> 32 years.

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:09.655 align:middle line:84%
August 1982 she was diagnosed,
stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

01:00:09.655 --> 01:00:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Pancreatic cancer.

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Alive 32 years later.

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:13.915 align:middle line:84%
Now, technically, I cannot
say the tumors went away

01:00:13.915 --> 01:00:15.880 align:middle line:84%
because she's refused to
do scans for 32 years.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> She is alive.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> She's alive.

01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's all
you need to know.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.661 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
know anything else.

01:00:19.661 --> 01:00:21.410 align:middle line:84%
The average survival
for stage 4 cancer,

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.201 align:middle line:84%
pancreatic cancer, in
those days and today,

01:00:23.201 --> 01:00:25.462 align:middle line:84%
is like three to
four, five months.

01:00:25.462 --> 01:00:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody lives beyond
about 18 months

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.380 align:middle line:90%
with with that kind of disease.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And this is 32 years.

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:31.820 align:middle line:10%
>> 32 years later.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:34.040 align:middle line:10%
Now if she had been a
conventional patient, treated

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:36.590 align:middle line:10%
at a conventional institution,
the American Cancer Society

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:37.760 align:middle line:10%
would have held a
press conference.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It would have been on the
cover of Time magazine.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.801 align:middle line:90%
>> All the news stories--

01:00:41.801 --> 01:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I remember about
10 years ago, there

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:47.840 align:middle line:84%
was one of these new chemo
drugs that was being touted

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and a group at Harvard
were pushing it.

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:52.140 align:middle line:84%
They ended up on Good
Morning America, ABC,

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.720 align:middle line:90%
CBS all the morning shows.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
One patient who had a regression
of disease at six months,

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and she got an all [INAUDIBLE],,
like a show horse being

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:04.160 align:middle line:90%
shown around all the TV shows.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that drug was later
taken off the market

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.064 align:middle line:84%
because it did
absolutely nothing.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:10.105 align:middle line:84%
But that didn't stop the
Harvard team from-- they

01:01:10.105 --> 01:01:11.442 align:middle line:90%
have a good publicity machine.

01:01:11.442 --> 01:01:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're Harvard
Medical School,

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
so if they have a chihuahua
that lives two months longer,

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.847 align:middle line:90%
they get on national TV.

01:01:17.847 --> 01:01:20.180 align:middle line:84%
We have a patient with state
4 pancreatic cancer-- and I

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
challenge anyone who watches
this to match the case.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Critics can criticize.

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:26.109 align:middle line:90%
Criticism is easy.

01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Any critic out there,
match the case.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll be impressed.

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> 32 years.

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Isaacs, in,
I guess, September

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
of this last year, we both
had the privilege of speaking

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
at a conference in
Atlanta and I was

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
able to speak to a
patient of yours that

01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:44.150 align:middle line:84%
is a pancreatic cancer
survivor of 13 years.

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:45.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you talk a
little about her?

01:01:47.010 --> 01:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll mention her
name, Sarah Cooper.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.535 align:middle line:84%
And talk about the
treatment protocol

01:01:51.535 --> 01:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
that you've used
with Sarah to be

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.922 align:middle line:84%
out 13 years with
pancreatic cancer,

01:01:54.922 --> 01:01:56.630 align:middle line:84%
which is supposed to
be a death sentence.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, she was originally
diagnosed in the fall of 2000.

01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:05.930 align:middle line:84%
She had been having
some digestive issues

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and then she started
losing a lot of weight,

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and she wasn't trying
to lose weight.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So she lost the weight, she was
having these digestive issues,

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and she went to see her
primary care physician whom

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I have to give a
lot of credit to

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:21.440 align:middle line:90%
for instantly doing a CAT scan.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.470 align:middle line:84%
She was found to have
a mass in the pancreas.

01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So a few months later,
it took a little time.

01:02:28.070 --> 01:02:31.196 align:middle line:84%
I think people were telling
her she should get surgery.

01:02:31.196 --> 01:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
were advocating.

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But she wasn't too
keen on that idea.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So eventually she did
get a needle biopsy,

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.700 align:middle line:84%
which showed that she had
a poorly differentiated

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
adenocarcinoma, which
is another way of saying

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.930 align:middle line:90%
it was really bad news.

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
types of pancreatic cancer.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So just to be absolutely sure,
the hospital sent the slides

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
on to an expert at the Mayo
Clinic, who also looked at them

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and said, yes, this
is pancreatic cancer.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the adenocarcinoma,
the nasty kind.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.220 align:middle line:84%
So they once again
suggested that she really

01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.020 align:middle line:90%
should have surgery.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.870 align:middle line:90%
But she had done her research.

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
She's a very smart
woman, and she

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.630 align:middle line:84%
had checked into
how well surgery

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:14.610 align:middle line:90%
works for pancreatic cancer.

01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Now surgery can be
curative, but even when

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
they think they can cure
it, in other words, when

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
they do all the scans and
there's no evidence of spread,

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of CAT scans and
the like, and they go in

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and they do the surgery,
it's a big procedure.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Some people die from
the procedure itself.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And only 25% of the people
that have that operation

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:39.240 align:middle line:90%
are, in fact, cured by it.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
The other 75% wind up
having a recurrence.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So Sarah's gut feeling was
this is not a good idea.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
She didn't want to
have this surgery.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So she wound up going on our
program off the protocol,

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:52.240 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And what she was advised to
do, then, the nuts and bolts

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.344 align:middle line:84%
of the program for her, large
doses of pancreatic enzymes,

01:04:00.344 --> 01:04:02.010 align:middle line:84%
some other supplements
that are designed

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.440 align:middle line:84%
to help support the
body as she fought

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
against the cancer, and
a diet, in her case, that

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
was predominantly
vegetarian, although it does

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
include eggs and fish,
some dairy products.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.205 align:middle line:84%
And the coffee enemas, and
other detoxification routines.

01:04:17.205 --> 01:04:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's the program
that she was on,

01:04:19.350 --> 01:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
which she's implemented
over the last 13 years now

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Quite an impressive
lady, too, by the way.

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, she really is.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Webster, let me
ask you a question.

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:34.530 align:middle line:10%
Let's say you went to the
doctor and he diagnosed you

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:36.370 align:middle line:10%
with pancreatic cancer.

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.170 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> What would you do personally?

01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:42.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing I
would think about was, yes!

01:04:42.915 --> 01:04:45.529 align:middle line:90%
Now I can experiment on myself.

01:04:45.529 --> 01:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I would probably
experiment on myself

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.070 align:middle line:84%
and if it didn't work
then I would use something

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
that's proven to work.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I would not-- I have
absolutely no fear of cancer,

01:04:53.730 --> 01:04:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and I doubt you have a
fear of cancer either.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.794 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:04:56.794 --> 01:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm so encouraged from this

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.570 align:middle line:90%
show tonight.

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm so encouraged every
time I hear about somebody

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
that's alive today because
of using a natural cancer

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.200 align:middle line:90%
treatment.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.949 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, heck,
I'm encouraged anytime

01:05:08.949 --> 01:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
anybody is alive that has
been diagnosed with cancer,

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:13.486 align:middle line:84%
even if it's from the
conventional treatments.

01:05:13.486 --> 01:05:15.979 align:middle line:84%
I got nothing against
them, but doing what I do,

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I advocate natural
cancer treatments.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that everywhere
I go, everywhere I speak,

01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting constantly bombarded
by people that are sending me

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
emails or coming
to shake my hand,

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
letting me know that thank
you for the information

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:29.130 align:middle line:90%
that you've shared.

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm alive today because of
some of that information

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.680 align:middle line:84%
that I used, that I implemented
in my treatment protocol,

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and although I was given a
death sentence, I'm alive today.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that will
bring a tear to my eye

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
quicker than to be introduced
to somebody that's alive today

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:46.286 align:middle line:84%
because of implementing
some of these treatments

01:05:46.286 --> 01:05:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
sharing with you.

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:51.514 align:middle line:84%
And it really reaffirms
to me that cancer does not

01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:52.680 align:middle line:90%
have to be a death sentence.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.520 align:middle line:90%
There always is hope.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.186 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you have this
information that we're sharing,

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:58.560 align:middle line:84%
as long as you're
being empowered

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
with this information, you
can make an informed decision

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can treat your cancer
the way that you decide to.

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.201 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to keep
that in mind tonight.

01:06:06.201 --> 01:06:07.614 align:middle line:90%
Go to bed, get some rest.

01:06:07.614 --> 01:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
This has been an
encouraging show.

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:10.905 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow's going to be
even more encouraging.

01:06:10.905 --> 01:06:13.625 align:middle line:84%
We're going to hear from more
cancer survivors and thrivers

01:06:13.625 --> 01:06:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that are alive today to
tell their story, that have

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:17.067 align:middle line:90%
been given that gift of life.

01:06:17.067 --> 01:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I know you're
going to be encouraged.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I thank you for
joining us tonight,

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.145 align:middle line:84%
and I look forward
to tomorrow night

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:26.115 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:06:26.115 --> 01:06:32.570 align:middle line:90%


01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:35.180 align:middle line:10%
I hope that one message that's
coming through loud and clear

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.280 align:middle line:10%
throughout The Quest
for the Cures Continues

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.380 align:middle line:10%
is that freedom does matter.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Not only our freedom to
choose treatments for cancer,

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
but also our free access
to nutritional supplements.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.100 align:middle line:10%
One person who's fighting for
our freedom to choose worldwide

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.200 align:middle line:10%
is Dr. Rob Verkerk,
who's the founder

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.990 align:middle line:10%
and director for the
Alliance for Natural Health

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:56.619 align:middle line:10%
International.

01:06:56.619 --> 01:06:58.410 align:middle line:10%
I'm here with Rob
Verkerk with the Alliance

01:06:58.410 --> 01:06:59.790 align:middle line:10%
for Natural Health
International.

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:01.930 align:middle line:10%
Rob, thank you for
being with us tonight.

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:03.477 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, fantastic
to be with you too.

01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:05.560 align:middle line:10%
>> And what I want to do
is get you, first of all,

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.740 align:middle line:10%
to tell our listeners
exactly who you are and what

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.610 align:middle line:10%
you're doing with ANH, and then
I've got a couple of questions

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:11.410 align:middle line:10%
for you.

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, just kind of
give us a background on you.

01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> ANH is all about working
very hard to protect sovereignty

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
over our bodies in order to
be able to manage our health,

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
have freedom of choice, ensure
that there is informed choice

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.690 align:middle line:84%
to make those choices, and allow
people to manage their health

01:07:30.690 --> 01:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
in the way that we have already
been doing for many hundreds

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and thousands of years.

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, modern
science comes along, now,

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and coupled with what we already
know from traditional systems,

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
most of the solutions to
most of the big diseases that

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:49.290 align:middle line:84%
are out there that are creating
a huge burden on health care

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
systems around the world,
the information is available

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:53.610 align:middle line:90%
but it's not getting to people.

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole
regulatory movement

01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that is being developed by very
large corporations in cahoots

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
with governments
that is increasingly

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
impinging on our ability to
choose products that can really

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
transform lives, transform
the quality of lives,

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate the burden
of disease that is really

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.523 align:middle line:90%
crippling society today.

01:08:15.523 --> 01:08:17.189 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mentioned
regulatory agencies.

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Now here in the United
States, we think of the FDA.

01:08:20.490 --> 01:08:22.689 align:middle line:84%
But you're working
with ANH International.

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Is the FDA the only
regulatory agency

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:26.310 align:middle line:90%
that we need to worry about?

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Not at all.

01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:32.500 align:middle line:84%
The FDA exists in different
forms in all other countries.

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
In some cases, you have
authorities like the FDA

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.060 align:middle line:84%
that deal both with
food and with drugs.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.660 align:middle line:84%
In other parts of
the world you've

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
got specific food authorities
and other drug authorities

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:46.560 align:middle line:90%
that are somewhat separated.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.790 align:middle line:84%
The difficulty, when you
have the same people dealing

01:08:50.790 --> 01:08:53.609 align:middle line:84%
both with food and
drugs, or sharing offices

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:58.020 align:middle line:84%
within similar buildings,
is that they inevitably

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.689 align:middle line:84%
develop a system
of regulation that

01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
works for the corporations
supplying the largest amount

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:06.540 align:middle line:90%
of money to those governments.

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.279 align:middle line:84%
And these people
are bureaucrats,

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.649 align:middle line:84%
so they're not necessarily
looking at the big picture.

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:12.420 align:middle line:84%
They're certainly
not looking at how

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:14.490 align:middle line:84%
they can resolve
the disease burden

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
in any particular country
or part of the world.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And the system, the
intricate system

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that is being developed by these
authorities working globally,

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
these groups of bureaucrats
working globally,

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:30.160 align:middle line:90%
is already being mapped out.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So if we look, say, at the
development over the last 40

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
years of the Codex
Alimentarius, this

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:40.859 align:middle line:84%
is how corporations and
governments have come together

01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:44.040 align:middle line:84%
in order to manage
the global food trade.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So the increasing availability
of processed foods

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.978 align:middle line:84%
or preserved foods or foods
that have been irradiated

01:09:51.978 --> 01:09:54.480 align:middle line:84%
or that have
relatively high levels

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of pesticide
residues, all of that

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
is being agreed at international
level through Codex.

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And it is being 100%
supported by the FDA

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and also by the European
Commission, that,

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:12.860 align:middle line:84%
interestingly, stands as a body
that represents the trading

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:17.910 align:middle line:84%
block of the 28-member states
that comprises Europe, which

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:20.070 align:middle line:84%
actually supports, now,
a population of close

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:22.140 align:middle line:90%
to half a billion people.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, in this
system at Codex,

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
there is a consensus
approach to decision making.

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
number of countries

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
such as the USA, Canada, Europe,
and Australia and New Zealand

01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:41.290 align:middle line:90%
that play a dominant role.

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:45.570 align:middle line:84%
If a smaller country, say a
sub-Saharan African nation,

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:47.760 align:middle line:84%
disagrees with any
of these issues,

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.350 align:middle line:90%
they tend to be quashed.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:53.880 align:middle line:10%
And as a result, you
get a system of trade

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.540 align:middle line:10%
that is meant to be
all about free trade,

01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:01.550 align:middle line:10%
but it's actually expanding
trade in products that--

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:03.270 align:middle line:10%
particularly food
products-- that

01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:07.710 align:middle line:10%
are right at the nub of the key
health problems that we have.

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:12.670 align:middle line:10%
So we look at the prevalence
of American-style foods

01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:17.700 align:middle line:10%
that are maybe typified
by, say, McDonald's

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:23.162 align:middle line:10%
or other processed foods, or the
products of Pepsi, for example,

01:11:23.162 --> 01:11:27.310 align:middle line:10%
or Coca-Cola, of which there
are many associated products,

01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:30.870 align:middle line:10%
or products from
Nestle that cover

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.740 align:middle line:10%
many, many different brands.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
These are the companies
that play the dominant role

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
so that their products
can be available in more

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
or less the same
form in supermarkets

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.390 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:46.260 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to health care
products that we choose to use,

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
such as vitamins
and herbs, Codex

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
is now directing its attention
to these kinds of products.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Initially, it's been
dealing with vitamins.

01:11:56.170 --> 01:11:59.930 align:middle line:84%
It's also dealing centrally
with the issue of claims.

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And claims is a
very important area,

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:07.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's what you can say
about the benefit of a product.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And essentially since
1997, it's been developing

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:13.950 align:middle line:84%
in a system of
guidelines about how

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
you should look at the
science that describes

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.010 align:middle line:90%
the benefits of a product.

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And this system is now
being put into effect

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
through a sophisticated
regulatory regime in Europe.

01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And what it's done is
it's initially thousands--

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
actually, around
2,000 health claims

01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that were commonly used for a
very wide range of vitamins,

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
amino acids, products that
are essential to life.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I gave an example yesterday
that if you look even

01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:50.460 align:middle line:84%
at the nine essential
amino acids, which

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:53.800 align:middle line:84%
are essential in the diet, not
a single approved health claim

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:54.600 align:middle line:90%
is allowed.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Whether something as important
as coenzyme Q10 or resveratrol,

01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:03.740 align:middle line:84%
health claims have not
been allowed for those.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So the implications is
that future generations,

01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
if they're never able to
receive positive information

01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
about these nutrients,
they will slowly

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.120 align:middle line:90%
believe that they're harmful.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at that coupled to
very proactive media campaigns

01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that the pharmaceutical
industry is engaged in,

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that deliberately work
to disincentivize people

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
from buying these products you
have a recipe for disaster.

01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So we are working
specifically, using

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:36.290 align:middle line:84%
what we call the tools of
good science and good law,

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:39.030 align:middle line:84%
because we believe that
both science and law can

01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:41.400 align:middle line:84%
be very much part
of the solution,

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.910 align:middle line:84%
although they've been
distorted in order to create

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:49.170 align:middle line:84%
the regime that currently is
prevalent in most societies

01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:50.070 align:middle line:90%
today.

01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And by using good
science and using

01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
good law, targeted legal
challenges, for example,

01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.480 align:middle line:84%
we're able to make
very strategic changes

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to the system, coupling
that with advocacy

01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:07.950 align:middle line:84%
so that you can use what
is left of crumbling

01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:09.900 align:middle line:90%
democratic systems.

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.750 align:middle line:10%
And also using,
most importantly,

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:15.540 align:middle line:10%
grassroots support,
by educating people

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:18.330 align:middle line:10%
about the benefits of
these sorts of products

01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:21.890 align:middle line:10%
and also the importance of them
becoming politically active

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:25.150 align:middle line:10%
so that we can all work
together to make change.

01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
That's how we can,
hopefully, work together

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.987 align:middle line:90%
to bring things back on track.

01:14:30.987 --> 01:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%

01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:40.867 align:middle line:84%
that you're making on the world
to educate and to keep us free,

01:14:40.867 --> 01:14:42.200 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we're all about.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.055 align:middle line:84%
And so I really appreciate

01:14:44.055 --> 01:14:44.490 align:middle line:90%
