00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back to "The Quest
for the Cures Continues,"

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.120 align:middle line:90%
folks.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that you
joined us tonight.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I hope that in last night's
episode, Nature's Pharmacy,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:84%
you learned a lot about
herbs, and vitamins,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and foods that can
give you health.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.514 align:middle line:84%
We're going to learn
more about that tonight.

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:84%
The importance of nutrition
just can't be stressed enough,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.305 align:middle line:84%
in light of the fact that even
many medical doctors don't

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Case in point.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
A good friend of mine who's
in "The Quest for the Cures

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Continues," Dr. Irvin Sahni--

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I actually went to
college with Dr. Sahni.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
He has texted me pictures
over the last couple of years

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
of the doctors' lounge at
the hospital where he works.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.486 align:middle line:84%
And in the doctors'
lounge, the foods that

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
are available for these doctors,
who are supposed to be helping

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:90%
us to get healthy--

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:84%
the foods available are
Cheetos, chips, candies,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and they've even got a whole
refrigerator full of sodas.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.149 align:middle line:84%
Diet sodas that are
full of aspartame.

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The chips are full of
genetically modified foods,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:84%
which we've already
learned about cause cancer.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So these are the health
professionals that

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:90%
are supposed to be teaching us.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:90%
There is a disconnect.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I was able to travel to
Austin, Texas and hook

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:84%
up with Mike Adams,
The Health Ranger.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:84%
The founder of naturalnews.com,
which is the second most

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:84%
visited natural health
website in the entire world.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And Mike shared with us
some amazing information

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:90%
about this disconnect.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.602 align:middle line:84%
He elaborated
further about how it

00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
is that these medical
professionals that are supposed

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.730 align:middle line:84%
to be keeping us
healthy really don't

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.109 align:middle line:84%
understand the importance of
good nutrition on our health.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I know you're going to learn
a lot from tonight's show,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
so pull up a chair, grab a pen
and paper, and take some notes.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.187 align:middle line:90%
Hope you enjoy the show.

00:01:47.187 --> 00:01:50.666 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:56.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, and it's also a great
example of the astonishing

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.650 align:middle line:10%
disconnect that exists in the
mainstream medical system.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:10%
>> They think that your body is
somehow disconnected from what

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.839 align:middle line:10%
you feed your body.

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is astonishing.

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that bizarre?

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Completely irrational,
illogical, unscientific.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So the good news
is that it becomes

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:84%
very easy to start waking people
up and start educating people

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:84%
about what's real in terms
of nutrition and health

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.040 align:middle line:84%
because people can
understand this.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
We live in a materialistic
type of society.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you start with the
material metaphor or a material

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.380 align:middle line:84%
explanation, you can make
good progress in this.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:84%
You can say, well, look, what
you eat and drink is digested

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes your
blood composition.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Your blood is made of
what you eat and drink.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And people say, yeah.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Unless you think your
blood is made magically,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.065 align:middle line:90%
which doesn't happen.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So then your blood circulates
throughout your body.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Your blood brings
the materials that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
then become your organs,
that fuel your brain,

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
your cognitive function,
that fuel the function of all

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:84%
your organs, and that
replenish and rebuild

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.745 align:middle line:90%
all the cells of your body.

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:12.370 align:middle line:84%
As you lose cells,
you build new cells.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:90%
You replace cells.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, what's in your blood
becomes your physical body,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:90%
And they say, Yeah.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Then you literally are
what you eat physically.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It's an inescapable conclusion.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.975 align:middle line:84%
So if you're eating junk,
if you're eating toxins,

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating heavy
metals, your body, your brain,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
your organs, your
skin, everything that's

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
in your physical body
becomes junk, becomes toxic,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:90%
becomes processed.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Not natural.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
That idea is not yet
recognized by the entire system

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:90%
of modern medicine.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.840 align:middle line:84%
With all its claimed advances,
, with all the billions

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
of dollars that have gone into
the cancer research industry,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
they still cannot yet grasp a
simple concept that a five year

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
old understands
almost automatically.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.060 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we want to be healthy,
we need to eat healthy foods.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.755 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it said that cancer
is a disease of malnutrition.

00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's see what Dr. Patrick
Quillin, who wrote the best

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
selling definitive book
on cancer and nutrition,

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
has to say about this
ever so important issue.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:19.969 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful fruit trees.

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:21.510 align:middle line:84%
You've already given
me a small tour.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take another
one later around your yard.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
At least a couple of dozen
different types of fruits.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So I can see from the place that
you live that you understand

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%
the impact of nutrition.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And so talk about the
impact of nutrition

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:90%
specifically on cancer.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.640 align:middle line:84%
What is cancer and
what does nutrition

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.190 align:middle line:90%
have to do with cancer?

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:10%
>> A broad, expansive sort
of global question here, Ty,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:10%
so forgive me if we take
a couple of side spurs.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
My book, "Beating
Cancer with Nutrition,"

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
which has sold a
half million copies

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and is considered the
definitive work in that area.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been translated
into five languages.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I organized three
international symposia

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of adjuvant
or helpful nutrition

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:90%
in cancer treatment.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And then a textbook came out
of that, "Adjuvant Nutrition

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:90%
in Cancer Treatment."

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is not
just hearsay and innuendo,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
but essentially there's
five main reasons

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
why all cancer patients
need to use nutrition

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
as part of their comprehensive
cancer treatment.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm forewarning, I
would not use nutrition

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:90%
as sole therapy against cancer.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.130 align:middle line:84%
It's insufficient, but
it is irreplaceable.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And so given that, let's just
think of the five main reasons

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
why every cancer patient needs
to include nutrition as part

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:90%
of their comprehensive therapy.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Number one,
nutrition actually is

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:90%
a big part of the malnutrition.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.865 align:middle line:84%
40% of cancer patients die
of malnutrition, not of

00:05:46.865 --> 00:05:47.890 align:middle line:90%
the cancer.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is a wasting disease.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Appetite is affected.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:84%
You end up in the
hospital with food

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.210 align:middle line:90%
that you're unfamiliar with.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Chemo and radiation can induce
kikexia, or lean tissue loss.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So malnutrition kills
40% of cancer patients.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.620 align:middle line:84%
The only therapy for
that is proper nutrition.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It sometimes needs
to be aggressive

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:84%
with a metabolic support
team such as total parenteral

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:90%
nutrition and other things.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Number two is that
nutrition can help

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
to make chemoradiation
and surgery more

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.882 align:middle line:90%
of a selective therapy.

00:06:18.882 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
chemo and radiation

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:90%
are non-selective toxins.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:90%
They're cytotoxic poisons.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.430 align:middle line:84%
They kill everything
in their pathway,

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and there is what they
call collateral damage.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So a patient who
is receiving chemo

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
is going to have a certain
amount of hair loss, nausea,

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.000 align:middle line:84%
vomiting, weight loss
all as part of the chemo,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
but nutrition can make
chemo, radiation, and surgery

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
more selectively
toxic to the tumor

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and less toxic to the patient.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is where a very
important part of my message

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is to get the oncologist,
and the nutritionist,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and the cancer patient in
the same room together,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
and they all have the goal
of beating this cancer.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, a
well-nourished cancer patient

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:84%
can better manage the disease
and the therapies that

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:90%
are used for it.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So number two is nutrition
makes chemo more of a rifle

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:90%
rather than a hand grenade.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Number three, we find that
cancer is a sugar feeder.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is what's called an
obligate glucose metabolizer,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:84%
meaning that there is a
dramatic uptake of glucose

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.100 align:middle line:90%
in the cells of tumor cells.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
If you can lower gut
and blood glucose,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.139 align:middle line:84%
you can help to
slow down cancer.

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number
of therapies now

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:84%
that target this
whole unique Achilles

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:90%
heel of the cancer cells.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Number four, we find
that your immune system

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to recognize
and destroy cancer cells.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
In a cancer patient, the immune
system has failed its duties.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.210 align:middle line:84%
There has to be some ways of up
regulating the immune system.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's a whole
study in itself.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Number five is that nutrients
can become biological response

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
modifiers.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1971 when Richard Nixon
launched the war on cancer,

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
he said, we will have a
cure for a major cancer

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
within five years, by
the bicentennial, 1976.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a cure for any
major cancer today either.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:90%
We have some better treatments.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, launching
the war on cancer--

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and we have now spent in the
neighborhood of $50 billion

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
in research at the
National Cancer Institute

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and over a trillion
dollars in therapies.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:10%
And we now have 40% of men born
today can expect to develop

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.850 align:middle line:10%
cancer in their lifetime.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.900 align:middle line:10%
In the year 1900, 3% could
expect to develop cancer

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:10%
in their lifetime.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:90%
We've got a problem there.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things we
know from cancer research

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and nutrition research is
that nutrients can become

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:90%
biological response modifiers.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.860 align:middle line:84%
They change the
way the body works.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:84%
A blatant example of that
would be every fall in America,

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:84%
August, September, about
30 young men athletes

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.280 align:middle line:90%
will die from heat stroke.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:90%
They're big people.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:90%
They're not properly hydrated.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:84%
They're out in 80, 90,
100, 110 degree heat.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:90%
They're practicing twice a day.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.810 align:middle line:90%
They don't hydrate properly.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And they can die
from dehydration.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:84%
The only cure for heat stroke
or dehydration is water.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And so water becomes a
biological response modifier

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:90%
in those patients.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
There are many cancer
patients for whom

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
fish oil, coenzyme Q, lipoic
acid, curcumin, there's

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:90%
just a long list of nutrients.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Vitamins, minerals,
probiotics, glandular extracts,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
many different
substances that can

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
become powerful therapeutic
aids for the cancer patient

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to restore their host
defense mechanisms.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Because here's the beauty--

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
a healthy human body is self
regulating and self-repairing.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:84%
The cancer patient has lost
that ability for some reason.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:84%
The job of everyone in
the hospital and everyone

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:84%
in the clinic should be to
restore that patient back

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
to their self-regulating and
self-repairing ability, which

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
is what nutrition does
as part of the package.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So nutrients can change
the way that a body works.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.957 align:middle line:84%
They're biological
response modifiers.

00:10:17.957 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And a healthy bodies should
be self-regulating and

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:90%
self-healing.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to
Dr. Sherri Tenpenny

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
as she discusses the
relationship of nutrition

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to cervical cancer
and the HPV vaccine.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:10%
>> And that brings
up another point.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:10%
Does the virus cause the cancer?

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:10%
Or is the cervix, which
is an exposed organ,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:10%
has a nutritional
deficiency, the organ

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:10%
starts to break down
and deteriorate,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:10%
and then the virus gets embedded
into that decaying and sick

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.140 align:middle line:10%
organ?

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And the medical community
says that the HPV

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
caused the cancer,
when in actuality, I

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:84%
believe that a lot of
cervical dysfunction

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.553 align:middle line:84%
and cervical displasias
are nutritional deficiency

00:10:56.553 --> 00:10:57.561 align:middle line:90%
diseases.

00:10:57.561 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And we've treated many of them
in our office with vitamin A,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:84%
vitamin D, vitamin C,
natural progesterone,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
get them to stop smoking, get
off the birth control pill,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and it clears up and goes away
in more than 90% of people

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.022 align:middle line:90%
that we have kept track of.

00:11:15.022 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you give the body
what it needs to run properly,

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:90%
it runs properly.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Imagine that.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So I suggest, number one,
let's go back to the basics.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:10%
I think one of my
jobs as a doctor

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:10%
is to counsel people on
how to eat appropriately.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:10%
And I can guarantee
you, most people

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:10%
are not eating appropriately.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
The standard American diet is
nutrient depleting for people.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:84%
It supplies them with
toxic chemicals that

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:84%
set the stage for chronic
illness like cancer,

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and arthritis, and other
illnesses to appear.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And unless they
learn to, number one,

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
eat appropriately
or eat better, I

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.750 align:middle line:84%
think that we're going to still
suffer this cancer problem.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Basic number one is,
let's eat a better diet.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we were growing up,
we learned in elementary school

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:90%
the food pyramid.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And the food pyramid
showed that we

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.684 align:middle line:84%
should eat the majority
of our food as grains.

00:12:03.684 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And remember, there
was a big loaf

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:90%
of bread there and crackers.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:10%
And grains were down in that
big part of the food pyramid,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:10%
and fats and oils were up on
top and it says, use sparingly.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, I could tell you, we
followed that food pyramid

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
since it was introduced.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was introduced in
the early 1970s or late 1960s.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And the consequences of
us, the American people,

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.820 align:middle line:84%
following this food pyramid
was that we ate more grains,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:84%
we limited our fats
and oils in our diet,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
we switched our fat intake from
primarily animal fat products

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
to using polyunsaturated
vegetable oils like corn oil,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and soybean oil, and some
other oils that are commonly

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.709 align:middle line:90%
sold at grocery stores.

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And the consequences
of that is we've

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:84%
become the most obese people
on the face of the planet.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.620 align:middle line:84%
We have more diabetes than
we know what to do with.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We have more metabolic syndrome
than we know what to do with.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And I say it's a direct
result of following

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the USDA's recommendation of
following the food pyramid.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.216 align:middle line:10%
>> Following the
sad American diet.

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Makes people sad,
and it makes people fat,

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.680 align:middle line:10%
and it makes people diabetic.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, once
diabetes comes into play,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
cancer and other
illnesses follow suit

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
as the blood sugar goes up
since cancer cells require

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
blood sugar to function, to
rev their metabolic rate.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.444 align:middle line:10%
>> So Dr. B, you just mentioned
the sad American diet.

00:13:22.444 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we've got the
pyramid with the grains,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:90%
and the oils at the top.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Very few.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.526 align:middle line:90%
Use sparingly.

00:13:27.526 --> 00:13:29.400 align:middle line:84%
What should a healthy
food pyramid look like?

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in one sense, maybe
we could flip the food pyramid

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:84%
on its access and make
the grains use sparingly

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:84%
because grains turn
into sugar very quickly.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And I frequently
tell my patients

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
to limit grains in
the diet and to use

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
a lot more fats in their
diet because fat slowly

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.467 align:middle line:90%
releases into the body.

00:13:49.467 --> 00:13:50.800 align:middle line:90%
And so what should it look like?

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.700 align:middle line:84%
I say people should eat whole
foods free of pesticides, free

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.500 align:middle line:90%
of hormones.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Organic.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>> And organic food.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And organic animal products
can be very healthy for people.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Such as organic eggs,
and organic meats,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.920 align:middle line:90%
and any organic product.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely needs
to be free of pesticides

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
because we know pesticides
are not metabolized well

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:10%
There's carcinogenic
studies with pesticides

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:10%
if we get enough of
them in our body.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:10%
And certainly, with the hormones
they're feeding the animals

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:10%
and the conventionally raised
animals, that's a big problem.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of
the things that's causing one

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.810 align:middle line:84%
in seven women to have breast
cancer or one in three men

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:90%
to have prostate cancer.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.450 align:middle line:10%
>> And also, just off the
top of my head I'm thinking,

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.550 align:middle line:10%
so the hormones in the
meats, the chickens,

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.091 align:middle line:10%
could that be one of the reasons
that so many young girls are

00:14:35.091 --> 00:14:36.570 align:middle line:10%
going into puberty so early?

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's no question
that's one of the reasons girls

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.610 align:middle line:90%
are going into puberty so early.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.640 align:middle line:84%
There's no question that's
why breast size has increased

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.710 align:middle line:84%
over the years, and
there's no question that's

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:90%
why breast cancer is increased.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And I say for men,
it's prostate cancer.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's no reason
they need to feed

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:90%
these hormones to the animals.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:90%
They should be limited.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.622 align:middle line:84%
And since they are
going to feed them

00:14:56.622 --> 00:14:57.996 align:middle line:84%
to conventionally
raised animals,

00:14:57.996 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the only thing we can do
is to eat a better diet.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. B, I know you've
written several books on diet,

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.880 align:middle line:90%
and food, and nutrition.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
those a little bit?

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've written these
books because I'm trying

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:84%
to teach people not to eat that
sad diet and to eat a better

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:10.810 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:84%
So the first book
that I wrote was

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:84%
"A Guide to Healthy
Eating," and just gave

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
an overview about how to better,
like what we're talking about.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.794 align:middle line:84%
My latest book is
"The Skinny on Fats."

00:15:21.794 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And I try and dispel
the myths of eating

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.845 align:middle line:84%
fat, and why we need to
eat good fats in our diet

00:15:25.845 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and why we can't go on
these low fat diets.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.341 align:middle line:84%
I think it stresses the body
out and causes more problems.

00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And particularly more
problems with people

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.847 align:middle line:84%
with chronic
disorders like cancer.

00:15:34.847 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you talk about good fats?

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
When you say good fats,
we need to be eating

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:90%
good fats, what are good fats?

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So good fats can be from
animal sources that are

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
organically raised
and organically fed.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Butter.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Butter.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Butter is a very good
fat for the body.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:10%
Organic eggs are the best pure
protein source for the body.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I live on five acres in
Texas and we have laying hens.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So we get fresh eggs every day
from our hens that free range.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:90%
So I'm with you.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:90%
I love eggs.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the best way to do it.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.382 align:middle line:90%
No question.

00:16:04.382 --> 00:16:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>> What about other kinds
of oils to cook with?

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:90%
What oils should we cook with?

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.219 align:middle line:90%
What oils should we be intaking?

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I know that one of the oils
that's a staple in our diet

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:90%
is coconut oil.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We were taught in elementary
school on the top of that food

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:84%
pyramid to use fats
and oils sparingly.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And we were also
taught to switch

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.580 align:middle line:84%
to polyunsaturated vegetable
oils like corn oil, and soybean

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:90%
oil, and those things.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Those things are a
disaster for the body.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:90%
They're nutrient depleted.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:middle line:84%
They're full of
trans fatty acids.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
They gum up the
body's receptors.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think the single best
cooking oil is coconut oil.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Palm oil is a good choice.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:84%
These things survive high
heat cooking very well.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.435 align:middle line:84%
Olive oil is OK for low heat
cooking or just in cool foods.

00:16:45.435 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:84%
For high heat cooking,
there's nothing better

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:90%
than coconut oil.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
We love to cook up organic
popcorn in coconut oil.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:90%
The kids get popcorn that way.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing better than
using coconut oil,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.700 align:middle line:84%
organic corn seeds, and
good salt. Unrefined salt.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>> What about nuts?

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:84%
What are some good
sources of fats?

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.506 align:middle line:84%
Because I know nuts
are almost all fat.

00:17:05.506 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So what's good sources
of fats in nuts?

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.588 align:middle line:84%
>> I think nuts
make a great snack.

00:17:08.588 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
They supply the
right fatty acids

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:13.230 align:middle line:84%
for our bodies, both omega
6 and omega 3 fatty acids.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
a healthy snack source.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Much better than a cracker
or some kind of grain

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.250 align:middle line:90%
based product.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But what would you
recommend with the nuts,

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:90%
should they be raw nuts?

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:84%
Or roasted are OK, but not
roasted in bad oils, of course.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Not cooked in bad oils.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:31.686 align:middle line:10%
>> So what I tell my patients
is that nuts do have some

00:17:31.686 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:10%
chemicals in them to inhibit
some of the absorption

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:10%
of minerals in our body.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.720 align:middle line:10%
They're called phytates.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.040 align:middle line:84%
You can minimize that or disrupt
that phytate formation by slow

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:90%
roasting the nuts.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So in my book, the
guide to healthy eating,

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.526 align:middle line:84%
we describe how to
slow roast nuts.

00:17:46.526 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you just
put them on a tray,

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.680 align:middle line:84%
cook them on low
heat for a few hours,

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and it makes them much
more tastier and much more

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:90%
healthier for our body.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
But I do think raw nuts
can be an OK snack as well.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.350 align:middle line:84%
But just watch out
for the bad oils.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.151 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:59.151 --> 00:18:01.066 align:middle line:84%
If you look kind on the
container of the nuts,

00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
they'll tell you when
they're made with soybean oil

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and they're roasted.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
If they're roasted in
soybean oil, or corn oil,

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.200 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that, they're not

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
going to be healthy because
the oil has been hydrogenated

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And now the GMO
factor as well, right?

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.590 align:middle line:90%
With soy and corn.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That's been a whole disaster.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
We're paying the price
for that as well.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So Dr. Brownstein just
elaborated on good oils

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.590 align:middle line:90%
and healthy fats.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to Bob Wright
and Suzanne Somers expound

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.040 align:middle line:90%
on this subject.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.576 align:middle line:10%
>> Talk about the good
oils like coconut oil.

00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, first of all, if you go
into a supermarket and you see

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:10%
all the oils there, the
sunflower, the safflower,

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:10%
the canola oil--

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.100 align:middle line:10%
folks, canola oil
is rapeseed oil.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:10%
It's used as a pesticide.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.580 align:middle line:10%
It's poison.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.580 align:middle line:10%
Most of these bottles
of oils and cans

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:10%
sitting on the shelves
in there are already

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.100 align:middle line:10%
rancid before you buy them.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:10%
They put industrial perfumes in
them to make them smell good.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:10%
Don't eat them.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.930 align:middle line:10%
The good oils, of
course, are olive oil.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:10%
Extra virgin olive
oil, particularly.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.174 align:middle line:10%
I always like extra
virgin because it's

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:03.535 align:middle line:10%
the least processed.

00:19:03.535 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:10%
But you've got to
be careful today.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.350 align:middle line:10%
Like 50% of the extra
virgin olive oils

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:10%
out there have
other oils in them,

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:10%
so you've got to know
what you're choosing.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.320 align:middle line:10%
But I like extra
virgin coconut oil.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:10%
And I have a couple of
tablespoons every day

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.960 align:middle line:10%
because we're seeing remarkable
things with people with

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.240 align:middle line:10%
neurodegenerative
diseases like ALS,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:10%
and Parkinson's,
and Alzheimer's.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing almost
immediate results

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:90%
with people that use these.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And the folks that
are listening to this

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:84%
can go up on the
internet and Google this.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
You can find the stories.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:10%
They're just rife
on the internet

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:10%
now about how these
people are utilizing

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:10%
these oils, two to
six tablespoons a day,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:10%
and they're seeing
results in 20 minutes.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:10%
Of course, you need to do more
than one day in 20 minutes

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.324 align:middle line:10%
to get results.

00:19:55.324 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:10%
But we're finding that
many people are getting

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:10%
incredible results all the
way to almost reversing

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.700 align:middle line:10%
their sickness and disease.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And boy, this is a great
start because there

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:84%
are no drugs out there that,
as we know, help these people.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:10%
They may ameliorate a few
symptoms for a little while,

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:10%
but these diseases progress.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:10%
Also, we need to detox.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.130 align:middle line:10%
We need to get those heavy
metals out of the body.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But this extra
virgin coconut oil--

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
the brain in these diseases
stops really utilizing glucose,

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and the brain starts to
struggle and suffer for energy.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:84%
So the medium chain
triglycerides,

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:84%
these good fats that we talk
about in the coconut oil,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.709 align:middle line:84%
are processed in the liver
and sent into the bloodstream

00:20:35.709 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:90%
and then go to the brain.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:10%
They become that
fuel for the brain

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.920 align:middle line:10%
so the brain starts
to function again.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:48.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I probably have four spoons
of coconut oil just on its own

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:84%
during the day because that's
so healing to the intestines.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.820 align:middle line:10%
And then I use it in my cooking.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Coconut oil is incredible.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:10%
In my Suzanne organic
skincare line,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:10%
we have coconut oil in
so many of the products.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
My products are
certified toxic free.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know of anybody
else who has that.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Organic.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And so certified
toxic free means

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:84%
it has to be grown organically,
extracted organically,

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:84%
and nothing upwind or
downwind of the product

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.630 align:middle line:90%
can be toxic to contaminate it.

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm developing a
nice little business

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
of people who want high quality
cosmetics, and skin care,

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:32.797 align:middle line:84%
and make up and don't
want any chemicals.

00:21:32.797 --> 00:21:34.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
of all the led women

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.296 align:middle line:84%
have taken in through
lipstick over the years.

00:21:36.296 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:90%
I make lead-free lipstick.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.930 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So coconut oil is
not just great to eat,

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
it's also good for your skin,
as Suzanne just talked about,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
because your skin absorbs
whatever touches it.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're putting
toxic makeups and perfumes

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.790 align:middle line:84%
on your skin, you're going
to absorb them as well.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, while we're on the
subject of healthy fats,

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk to Dr.
David Jockers, who's

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
an expert on the ketogenic
diet, which really relies

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
on healthy fats to help
the body work the way

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:90%
that it's supposed to.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You had mentioned with
the ketosis and the ketogenic

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:90%
diet--

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
to me, it sounds almost
like the Atkins diet,

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
if you remember from 20 years
ago or so when the Atkins

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:14.710 align:middle line:90%
diet was real popular.

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it the same thing
as the Atkins diet,

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.660 align:middle line:90%
or what is different?

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
When you hear the ketogenic diet
versus the old Atkins diet--

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:84%
a lot of bodybuilders that
I knew back in the '90s

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
went from the low fat
diet to the Atkins diet

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
where there were literally guys
at the gym who were working out

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:35.082 align:middle line:84%
eating cheese, and bacon, and
peanut butter in between sets.

00:22:35.082 --> 00:22:35.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:35.882 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the difference between
these two types of diets?

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a great, great question.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm really glad you brought that
up because, in general, Atkins

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.280 align:middle line:90%
diet is a ketogenic diet.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:84%
It does stimulate
ketone development.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:10%
And the way that some
individuals teach it,

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:10%
they're almost identical.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:10%
However, what
we're really trying

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:10%
to promote optimal
health, we've got

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:10%
to make some differentiations
from the Atkins diet.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So where Atkins went
right was his approach

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.710 align:middle line:84%
with a low carbohydrate
diet, getting our body

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:04.710 align:middle line:90%
running off the ketones.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.626 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in total agreement
with him about that.

00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Keeping our body very
sensitive to insulin.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Very, very important.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.710 align:middle line:84%
However, where I
disagree with him was he

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.110 align:middle line:84%
really had no regulation
on the kind of fats

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that you put into
your body, and we

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.060 align:middle line:84%
want to really focus on good
fats as opposed to bad fats.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So most people in our society
assume that saturated fat

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.102 align:middle line:90%
is a bad fat.

00:23:25.102 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:84%
What we know is that
actually, saturated fat is

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:84%
one of the most healthiest fats
we can be putting in our body.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The fats we really want
to avoid are high omega

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
6 fats from refined vegetable
oils and also from factory

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:90%
farmed animal meats.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.280 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big one.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.245 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, trans
fats or man made fats.

00:23:44.245 --> 00:23:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So we certainly want
to make sure we're

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:90%
avoiding those things.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
load up on good fats.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Things like avocados.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Things like coconut oil.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Butter from grass fed cows.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Individuals that can
tolerate dairy protein,

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:84%
if they can tolerate
casein, we're

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.690 align:middle line:90%
going to use things like cheese.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Raw cheese from grass fed
cows, fermented dairy drinks

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.340 align:middle line:90%
from, again, grass fed cows.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge
difference between when

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:90%
a cow is fed grass and grains.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
A grain fed cow actually
grows much larger

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:90%
and produces a lot more dairy.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they produce about
20,000 to 30,000 pounds

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
of dairy in a year,
a grain fed cow.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.090 align:middle line:84%
A grass fed cow produces
about 3,000 to 5,000 pounds.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge
difference in yield.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the grain fed cow,
though, the grains themselves

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:36.000 align:middle line:84%
are high in this omega 6
fat, and omega 6 fat causes

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.900 align:middle line:90%
inflammation in our body.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So the dairy that's coming
from a grain fed cow

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:84%
is very high in omega
6, very low in omega 3.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.170 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be inflammatory.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And that inflammatory process,
high omega 6, low omega 3,

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:84%
provides a ripe environment
for cancer cell development

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.096 align:middle line:84%
So we definitely
want to stay away

00:24:55.096 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:84%
from commercially raised
animal products and animals

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:90%
that were fed grains.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:90%
We want to stay away from that.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But we do want the grass fed
animal products because they

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.945 align:middle line:90%
have a lot of omega 3s.

00:25:06.945 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:84%
An ideal ratio of
omega 6 to omega 3s.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Also, grass fed dairy has
a molecule called CLA,

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.820 align:middle line:84%
conjugated linoleic acid, which
many researchers are finding

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.160 align:middle line:90%
is a potent anti carcinogen.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:84%
There's also other great
nutrients in there.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.980 align:middle line:84%
For example, the major fat
that's in grass fed dairy

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:90%
is called butyric acid.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Butyric acid is a preferred fuel
source for healthy gut microbes

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
in your system, and it
helps your intestinal cells

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:84%
to develop and
actually to strengthen.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So that way, we don't develop
problems like leaky gut

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, and
ulcerations in our gut,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and things like that, which is
extremely important for helping

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:90%
our immune system.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.680 align:middle line:84%
70% of our immune
systems is in our gut,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.302 align:middle line:84%
and if we have
damage to our gut,

00:25:54.302 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have a lot of
immune system disorders, which

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.020 align:middle line:84%
could include cancer and
other autoimmune diseases.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So this grass fed raw dairy
can have an incredible effect

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:84%
at helping the gut
to heal and seal

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:90%
and to control itself well.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's such a good
fat source we want to include.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.150 align:middle line:84%
We also want include things
like extra virgin olive

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:84%
oil, healthy seeds like flax
seed, hemp seeds, chia seeds.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
coconut products.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:84%
That should be an
absolute staple.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Coconut is a superfood.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.699 align:middle line:84%
Very anti-inflammatory and
just powerful for our body.

00:26:26.699 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So these are the kind of good
fats we want to focus on.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.030 align:middle line:90%
We want to stay away from--

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:84%
again, Atkins never
differentiated

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:90%
between grass fed and grain fed.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So it was a lot of
commercial animal

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:84%
products using lard, and
bacon, and things like that.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And the other aspect
of it is that bacon,

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm really not a big fan of,
just from the perspective

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.180 align:middle line:84%
that it is cooked at
very high temperatures.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And it may be nitrate free,
which is certainly a better one

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.360 align:middle line:84%
to go with, but
when you cook meat

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
at a very high
temperature, you're

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.560 align:middle line:84%
going to produce a lot
of carcinogenic products.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Things like heterocyclic
amines, polycyclic aromatic

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.160 align:middle line:84%
hydrocarbons,
acrylamide, and these

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.820 align:middle line:84%
are known to cause cancer
growth in our body.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:10%
And so high heat or highly
processed animal products,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.280 align:middle line:10%
even if it's properly
raised, can also

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:10%
be a factor with
cancer set of elements.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.600 align:middle line:10%
So we want to look for
animal products that

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.610 align:middle line:10%
have been minimally processed.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we cook them, we want
to cook them more medium rare.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So a lower temperature, and
just cooking them for less time

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:84%
so that way we produce less
of those heterocyclic amines.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.742 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
different strategies

00:27:37.742 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that people can apply
with marinades and things

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:84%
like that to utilize
the animal products

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and minimize the production
of carcinogenic chemicals.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ever
recommend fasting?

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>> For their health and
for cancer patients.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:51.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:27:51.842 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:90%
And you just brought that up.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And so just talking about the
ketogenic cleanse, I mean,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.030 align:middle line:90%
it is a fast.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big fan of
intermittent fasting.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.980 align:middle line:84%
It's something I do
every single day.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.894 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a critical
piece of a cancer killing diet.

00:28:05.894 --> 00:28:07.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, really, when
we break down fasting--

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.339 align:middle line:84%
I want all our listeners
to understand this.

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I look at a building phase
and a cleansing phase.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.755 align:middle line:84%
So our building
phase is the time

00:28:13.755 --> 00:28:16.090 align:middle line:84%
between our first
meal of the day

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:90%
and our last meal of the day.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So the typical American,
they might eat at 8:00 AM

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.700 align:middle line:90%
and finish eating at 8:00 PM.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.524 align:middle line:84%
So that's about a 12
hour building phase.

00:28:23.524 --> 00:28:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the
cleansing phase would

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:84%
be the time from our last
meal to our first meal.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.640 align:middle line:90%
That's like a one to one ratio.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
In our society today,
we've got so much toxicity

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that it's that
much more important

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:38.314 align:middle line:84%
that we have a greater cleansing
phase than building phase.

00:28:38.314 --> 00:28:39.730 align:middle line:84%
On top of that,
the great thing is

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:84%
when we're on this
ketogenic diet,

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.300 align:middle line:90%
our hormones become balanced.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Insulin and leptin, which
is our satiety hormone--

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:84%
so it helps us say that
we're no longer hungry.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.280 align:middle line:90%
We're satisfied.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.363 align:middle line:90%
They become very balanced.

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Our body becomes
very sensitive to it.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.290 align:middle line:90%
So we're really not as hungry.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And so for myself, I like to
have anywhere between a 16

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:03.670 align:middle line:84%
to 18 hour, and sometimes
even a 24 hour cleansing

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.459 align:middle line:90%
phase on a regular basis.

00:29:05.459 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Like we're doing
this interview here,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.330 align:middle line:84%
it's 11:30, 12:00, I haven't
eaten anything yet today.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:90%
I worked out this morning.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.080 align:middle line:84%
My blood sugar is
extremely stable.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.920 align:middle line:90%
I feel really good.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.840 align:middle line:90%
I feel really mentally clear.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll typically
eat around 1:00

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.870 align:middle line:84%
or so, and then finish eating
by, let's say, 6:00, 7:00,

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.817 align:middle line:84%
and so that's really
my building phase.

00:29:24.817 --> 00:29:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I've gotten all
the nutrients I need,

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:84%
but my body's also been able
to really cleanse and detoxify

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:84%
as I've gone through
this cleansing phase.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And on the cleansing phase,
like, for example, the fasting

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:84%
this morning, I've drank
probably about a half gallon

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:90%
of water so far today.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
So water is key because I want
to move toxins out of my body

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and I want them to
just recirculate

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:84%
as they're being released
as my body is breaking down

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:90%
fat cells.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting information
on fasting from Dr. Jockers.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And he mentioned grass
fed meat several times.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Because you are what you eat.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Animals are what they eat.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to Dr.
Ben Johnson describe

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.980 align:middle line:84%
why it's so important that
animals are properly raised.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:10%
What does your diet look like?

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:10%
>> My diet that I want my
patients eating looks green.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:10%
Very green.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:10%
Vegetables.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.800 align:middle line:10%
Lots of vegetables.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.430 align:middle line:10%
All kinds of vegetables
in all forms.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:23.410 align:middle line:10%
But key to that is the
fresher, the better.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:27.610 align:middle line:84%
So cutting to you, the
less time, the better.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.980 align:middle line:84%
If you have your own
garden, that's awesome.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And then secondly is
organic, because you

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.860 align:middle line:84%
don't want those
pesticides, and chemicals,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and artificial fertilizers and
things working against you.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:46.210 align:middle line:10%
So fresh, raw,
organic are the keys.

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:10%
Vegetables, and then
nuts and fruits.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.490 align:middle line:10%
And I do allow my patients to
eat small portions of meat.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.430 align:middle line:10%
I want it to be organic,
free range, or wild

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:10%
caught harvested.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:07.030 align:middle line:10%
>> So the way that the animals
are raised affects the meat.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.810 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, we have all these
studies showing that two eggs

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.330 align:middle line:10%
a week causes increase
in prostate cancer,

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:10%
and red meat causes
colon cancer,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.520 align:middle line:10%
and all of these studies, but
you don't see anybody comparing

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.740 align:middle line:10%
organic free range eggs
against pen fed chickens.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.110 align:middle line:10%
You don't see the
free range meat.

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.930 align:middle line:10%
So I would love to see
those studies done.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.100 align:middle line:10%
Of course, no drug company
is going to fund those

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.300 align:middle line:10%
and no independent farmer
has the money to do that.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't think the
meat, the eggs,

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:44.650 align:middle line:10%
the things are the problem, I
think it's what we do to them.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:48.640 align:middle line:10%
We put a chicken or a
cow in a pen, or a hog,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.505 align:middle line:10%
and we feed them
genetically modified corn.

00:31:51.505 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:10%


00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.869 align:middle line:10%
That's not their diet.

00:31:55.869 --> 00:31:57.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they're out there
eating grass, including

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.300 align:middle line:10%
the chickens, and crickets.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.500 align:middle line:10%
And so they're out
there eating things

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:10%
that when we raise
them commercially,

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:10%
that's not what
we're feeding them.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.380 align:middle line:10%
So now they have concentrated
genetically modified corn

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:10%
and other chemicals
in their body,

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.750 align:middle line:10%
and then we eat that and
concentrate it in ours.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:24.490 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not a vegetarian.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I have no problem
with vegetarians

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.720 align:middle line:84%
as long as they get adequate
amounts of protein, which

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes difficult to do
unless they're educated as

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:33.520 align:middle line:90%
to how to get those.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain amino acids

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that you just don't find
in vegetables at all.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.740 align:middle line:10%
But we have nice
supplements these days,

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:42.310 align:middle line:10%
so you can go to a supplement
store and get those.

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.060 align:middle line:10%
So I don't have a problem with
a patient being a vegetarian,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.950 align:middle line:10%
but I certainly
don't have a problem

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:55.550 align:middle line:10%
with them being omnivarian
because we need protein.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.450 align:middle line:10%
Especially our immune
systems need protein.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.019 align:middle line:10%
I just want it to
be healthy protein.

00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know about you, but
when I eat some good grass fed

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.950 align:middle line:84%
meat or some pastured poultry,
I like to put some spices on it.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the spices that I
like to include is sodium.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.920 align:middle line:84%
We've heard a lot of
bad things about sodium.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.010 align:middle line:90%
It's gotten a bad rap.

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:13.843 align:middle line:90%
It's been demonized.

00:33:13.843 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
You should not include
sodium in your diet.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.320 align:middle line:90%
But is that true?

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to a man who's
written a book on sodium,

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Dr. David Brownstein.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. B, I know you've
written a book about salt.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.035 align:middle line:84%
What bearing does that have
on our conversation here?

00:33:26.035 --> 00:33:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Ty, we've been talking
about sort of doing the basics.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.795 align:middle line:90%
You know, eating a better diet.

00:33:30.795 --> 00:33:32.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the other
basics is making

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:84%
sure you maintain adequate
hydration, drink enough water.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Taking iodine I consider
one of the basics.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:10%
And salt is one of the four
basic things people need.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:44.547 align:middle line:10%
Our bodies need and require
adequate amounts of salt daily.

00:33:44.547 --> 00:33:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Salt is the second major
constituent next to water

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.560 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.020 align:middle line:84%
The immune system can't
function well without salt,

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:84%
a hormonal system can function
well without salt, and iodine

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.990 align:middle line:84%
can't work in the body without
adequate amounts of salt.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So I consider salt
one of the basics.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.580 align:middle line:84%
I check salt levels on every
patient that comes in the door.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.160 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you the vast
majority are salt deficient.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when I talk about salt,
as I write about in my book,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.139 align:middle line:84%
"Salt Your Way to Health,"
there's good and bad salt.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:14.920 align:middle line:84%
I would say an inadequate
form of salt is refined salt.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.074 align:middle line:84%
It's the little white crystals
that we're all used to.

00:34:18.074 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:84%
They fit in the salt shaker,
and they're real fine,

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.408 align:middle line:84%
and they contain a
little bit of iodine.

00:34:22.408 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:84%
But they only contain sodium
and chloride, a little bit

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:26.650 align:middle line:84%
of iodine, and they
have toxic chemicals

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:30.310 align:middle line:84%
such as ferrous cyanide, they
have some bleach properties,

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.439 align:middle line:84%
bleach chemicals in
them to make it white.

00:34:32.439 --> 00:34:33.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Make it white.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not a good product.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.850 align:middle line:84%
A better product
is unrefined salt,

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.670 align:middle line:84%
which has over 80 minerals in
it, lesser amounts of sodium

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:40.470 align:middle line:90%
and chloride.

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:42.053 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have a
lot of iodine in it,

00:34:42.053 --> 00:34:44.230 align:middle line:84%
so therefore you need to
supplement with iodine.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:84%
But this is a staple that
people need in their diets.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
The adrenal system can't
function well without salt,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:84%
the thyroid system can't
function well without salt,

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system can't
function well without salt.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And iodine works much better
in the body with salt,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
as salt helps to
usher out bromide

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and fluoride in the body
while you take iodine.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.560 align:middle line:84%
So many diets I've
heard about, people

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that think they're getting
healthy, they say, OK.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not eating any more
salt. Not a good idea.

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only is it not a good
idea, it's a disastrous idea.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the adrenals
get overstressed from this

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and don't function
well, but it's not

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.585 align:middle line:90%
good for the immune system.

00:35:22.585 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not good for
fighting cancer.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.760 align:middle line:10%
People need salt in their diet.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.660 align:middle line:10%
It's a staple.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:10%
Human beings have needed salts
since the beginning of time.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.800 align:middle line:10%
We were designed by
our maker to need salt.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.080 align:middle line:90%
How much salt?

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.057 align:middle line:84%
About a teaspoon a
day for most people.

00:35:38.057 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
The latest studies that just
came out in the New England

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.764 align:middle line:84%
Journal of Medicine
verified what

00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I've been saying for
the last 15 years.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I blog about this and write
about it in my newsletter

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.436 align:middle line:90%
as those studies came out.

00:35:49.436 --> 00:35:50.560 align:middle line:90%
You can look at the curves.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.851 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy to look at them.

00:35:51.851 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:84%
You see high mortality rate
on the low end of salt intake,

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.140 align:middle line:90%
and then it goes down.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't really matter
how much salt you use.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe at very high
rates there's problems,

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.207 align:middle line:84%
but people aren't going to
eat that amount of salt.

00:36:03.207 --> 00:36:04.790 align:middle line:84%
They just need the
right kind of salt,

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:84%
which is unrefined salt
such as Celtic brand sea

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.150 align:middle line:84%
salt, Redmond's Real
Salt, the Himalayan salt.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I've tested all three
versions of those four times.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't find toxic
agents and I found

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:18.220 align:middle line:84%
adequate amounts of minerals
in all of those kinds.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I think those are very
healthy forms of salt.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Brownstein mentioned that
one of his four pillars is that

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.221 align:middle line:84%
you drink plenty of water,
which only makes sense since

00:36:25.221 --> 00:36:27.850 align:middle line:90%
your body is 75% water.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.220 align:middle line:84%
So you technically are
what you drink, aren't you?

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If we really look at our
body, 3/4 of our body is water,

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.530 align:middle line:90%
if we're properly hydrated.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Most people are not.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.060 align:middle line:10%
We know that 70%
to 80% of America

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.370 align:middle line:10%
is chronically dehydrated, so
that's another whole problem.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:10%
But why is water important?

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Water, believe it or not,
functions in every system.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.570 align:middle line:84%
From joints to the brain
to the blood is 93% water.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So people don't think--
even down to the bones

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.330 align:middle line:90%
are 13% to 22% water.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So water is everywhere
in our system,

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's critical to health
that we are properly hydrated.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.300 align:middle line:84%
When we are not
properly hydrated,

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.290 align:middle line:84%
our metabolic rate is
reduced, our thought processes

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:84%
are reduced, the toxins that
we are supposed to be removing

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.800 align:middle line:84%
are not happening,
and so our bodies

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.350 align:middle line:84%
are taxed and
burdened with having

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.220 align:middle line:90%
to do that in other ways.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we end up
with skin issues,

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.890 align:middle line:84%
we end up with a lot of
different pathology just

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.360 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
chronic dehydration

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
putting water in.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I call water our filtration
system for our body.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So when we bring water
in to our system,

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.840 align:middle line:84%
we want to void out that
same amount of water,

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.840 align:middle line:84%
but take some things with
it that we didn't want

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.242 align:middle line:90%
in our body in the first place.

00:37:41.242 --> 00:37:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
I look at water.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And if water is structured
properly, it will do that.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Free radicals are
missing an electron.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Our cells functional
electrically.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are
electric and we have

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.540 align:middle line:84%
a lot of electricity
and electrons

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.280 align:middle line:90%
that are flowing in our system.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
without electrons,

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.000 align:middle line:90%
cells don't function properly.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And the way free radicals
harm us is they go and steal

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.190 align:middle line:90%
electrons from healthy cells.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So a free radical is what
that's missing an electron?

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an oxygen.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oxygen.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So a free radical is an
oxygen missing with one of its

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:13.980 align:middle line:90%
eight electrons.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.690 align:middle line:90%
So it only has seven electrons.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:15.960 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So typically oxygen
has eight electrons?

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.164 align:middle line:84%
And a free radical
is an oxygen atom

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:21.330 align:middle line:90%
that is missing one of them.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So what it will do is it
will go throughout the body

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and steal electrons from healthy
cells that are weaker than

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the oxygen itself and
take it from them.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, when it does
that, that cell

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.020 align:middle line:84%
no longer functions
appropriately

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:84%
or can't function at all,
depending on what kind of cell

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.020 align:middle line:90%
it is.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's why free
radicals harm our system.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.230 align:middle line:84%
If we take out a percentage
of our cells not functioning,

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.824 align:middle line:84%
we lessen the entire
effectiveness of our system.

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking part your
engine away in a vehicle.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to go.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So in our body being
taxed, and taxed, and taxed,

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.030 align:middle line:84%
not only toxins, but we're
actually oxidizing ourselves.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.240 align:middle line:10%
Or that's what free radicals do
is they're stealing electrons,

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:10%
and electrons are the fuel.

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.950 align:middle line:10%
It's got to function
electrically.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.810 align:middle line:10%
You've got to have
those electrons.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:10%
So when we have
water that's properly

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.670 align:middle line:10%
structured with a negative
electrical charge,

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:14.550 align:middle line:10%
for instance, there's a
net gain or an increase

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:10%
of one electron, which
can be donated to complete

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.510 align:middle line:10%
those free radicals.

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.210 align:middle line:84%
It's basically what
an antioxidant does.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Any antioxidant that people are
choosing has an extra electron,

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and that's how
antioxidants function

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.950 align:middle line:90%
with the cellular system.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:32.345 align:middle line:84%
>> So then they donate that
extra electron to the oxygen

00:39:32.345 --> 00:39:33.720 align:middle line:84%
atom that's missing
the electron.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> To the free radicals.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And it basically
completes the oxygen atom.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So your blood is 93% water.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And properly structured
water acts as an antioxidant

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and is rich in minerals,
delivering them your body.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.575 align:middle line:90%
Minerals are important.

00:39:48.575 --> 00:39:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to
some experts talk

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:52.590 align:middle line:84%
about the difference between the
old diet, the primitive diet,

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:84%
and our modern diet full
of fast foods and virtually

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:90%
worthless foods.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.750 align:middle line:10%
>> There's over 300 studies
showing that a diet rich

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:10%
in fruits and vegetables can
dramatically lower the risk

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.100 align:middle line:10%
for most cancers.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.050 align:middle line:10%
That should be enough evidence.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the United States
Department of Agriculture

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.100 align:middle line:84%
complains that the top
three most commonly consumed

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.550 align:middle line:84%
vegetables in America is
ketchup, French fries,

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:18.811 align:middle line:90%
and onion rings.

00:40:18.811 --> 00:40:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know that sounds
humorous, because those are not

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.500 align:middle line:90%
vegetables in my opinion.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:90%
They're highly processed.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Ketchup is mostly
sugar, corn syrup.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And the others are high
in hydrogenated fat.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's very few vegetables
and fruits being consumed.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:35.610 align:middle line:84%
The government sort of bends
rules to basically accommodate

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:90%
big business.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.760 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look at every simple--

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm using the word simple rather
than primitive or aboriginal--

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.389 align:middle line:10%
society, cancer is unknown.

00:40:44.389 --> 00:40:46.180 align:middle line:10%
In other words, a famous
Harvard Researcher

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.896 align:middle line:10%
called Vilhjalmur Stefansson--

00:40:47.896 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sure how to
pronounce his name.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.880 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously a Norwegian
or a Swedish name.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Works for me.

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.350 align:middle line:84%
>> My best shot is
Vilhjalmur Stefansson.

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And he lived with Eskimos
for about 30 years.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't say Eskimos.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:90%
Inuit, but you know what I mean.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.420 align:middle line:84%
He lived with them,
and he ate their food,

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.490 align:middle line:90%
and lived their lifestyle.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And at first, he couldn't
tolerate the diet.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:11.490 align:middle line:90%
It was about 50% fat.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It was just slopping
with grease in the dish.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.100 align:middle line:90%
So he said, no.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.060 align:middle line:90%
I can't take it.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll eat more the Western way.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.654 align:middle line:84%
And within a few weeks,
he was pretty sick

00:41:19.654 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and he had to eat their way.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:23.339 align:middle line:84%
As soon as he did, his
body recovered enormously

00:41:23.339 --> 00:41:24.630 align:middle line:90%
and he was really fit and well.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:25.950 align:middle line:90%
He was out on the ice.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.010 align:middle line:90%
He could walk 50 miles in a day.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.690 align:middle line:84%
He was a really
fit man for his age

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and brought back a
very interesting story

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.570 align:middle line:90%
and wrote a book.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:84%
But basically, in all his
time in that territory,

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.590 align:middle line:90%
he never saw a case of cancer.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty well
unknown amongst the Inuit.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It's only when they
came into the bases,

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:46.900 align:middle line:84%
started eating the
burgers and the colas

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.680 align:middle line:84%
that they started to get
diabetes, heart disease, cancer

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:90%
the same as the rest of us.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a picture
that repeats itself

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you know Albert Schweitzer,
the famous humanitarian?

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.290 align:middle line:84%
He went to work in
the Gabon in Africa.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said he never
saw a case of cancer

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.150 align:middle line:84%
in anyone that was living
the natural lifestyle.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:07.980 align:middle line:84%
He directly
attributed it to food.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.640 align:middle line:84%
He was pretty sure
that was the reason.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.880 align:middle line:90%
They just eat differently.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.799 align:middle line:90%


00:42:13.799 --> 00:42:15.590 align:middle line:84%
It's tempting to think,
well, it's genetic.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Inuits are
just strong against cancer.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And they do eat a lot of
selenium from the seafood,

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.930 align:middle line:90%
and we know that's protected.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:25.491 align:middle line:84%
The real killer
in the story, Ty,

00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:27.615 align:middle line:84%
is if they go and move into
a different environment

00:42:27.615 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:84%
and eat somebody
else's diet, they

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:84%
get sick as dogs just the
same as the rest of us.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really
a genetic factor.

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:39.120 align:middle line:84%
But that's pretty stark,
epidemiological evidence.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.310 align:middle line:84%
You almost don't need
any other cause of cancer

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:44.280 align:middle line:84%
if you know that people
living the natural lifestyle

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.700 align:middle line:84%
in the Stone Age or aboriginal
way, like a hunter gatherer,

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and keeping their lifestyle
pure never gets cancer.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Our food has been hijacked.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.130 align:middle line:10%
Our food has been degraded
to the point where

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:10%
it no longer holds nutrition
that a human body needs

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:10%
for support, and nutrition
is the fuel of the body.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So the higher quality
of food you put in,

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.855 align:middle line:84%
the more your body
will operate at max.

00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all kind of simple.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It makes too
much, doesn't it?

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a radio
interview the other day

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking about the
obesity epidemic with children.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's just
stop for a minute.

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Do you really think
by giving kids

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.150 align:middle line:84%
smaller sodas and
less French fries

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that that's going to
tackle the obesity issue?

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, no one wants
to call it what it is.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.140 align:middle line:90%
The kids are eating chemicals.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:41.070 align:middle line:90%
Processed foods, packaged foods.

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And chemicals-- I remember when
I was interviewing Dr. Russell

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Blaylock.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, they design chemicals
to taste scrumptious.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the
first food a kid gets,

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:55.080 align:middle line:84%
he said, you have to bribe them
to get a floret of broccoli

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.480 align:middle line:84%
in them and a piece of
chicken so that they can have

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.070 align:middle line:90%
the foods they really love.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what needs to
happen in schools is education

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:09.000 align:middle line:84%
about there are no safe
levels of chemicals

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.470 align:middle line:90%
for any human body.

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:12.330 align:middle line:90%
That needs to just be known.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with Suzanne Somers.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:15.120 align:middle line:90%
We are what we eat.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And if we eat chemicals, we're
going to become chemicals.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to cancer
survivor Chris Wark share

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:23.580 align:middle line:84%
how he cured his cancer
changing only his nutrition.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what did
my diet look like?

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.870 align:middle line:90%
It was very simple.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:10%
And I think a hard core
nutritional approach to cancer

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.740 align:middle line:10%
needs to be very simple because
there are a lot of options

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.540 align:middle line:10%
out there.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.230 align:middle line:90%
It can get very complicated.

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:40.545 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
they're seeing

00:44:40.545 --> 00:44:42.420 align:middle line:84%
so many different
directions, they don't even

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.620 align:middle line:84%
know where to go and
they get paralyzed.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:90%
And so I realized, OK.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:51.150 align:middle line:84%
What is the most fundamental,
foundational part

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.680 align:middle line:90%
of my healing approach?

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's food.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get as much
nutrition in my body

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.400 align:middle line:90%
as I can from the earth.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I started juicing
and I drank about 64 ounces

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.160 align:middle line:90%
of vegetable juice every day.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Mostly carrot juice.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.515 align:middle line:84%
I ate giant salads full
of cruciferous and allium

00:45:08.515 --> 00:45:09.315 align:middle line:90%
vegetables.

00:45:09.315 --> 00:45:14.310 align:middle line:84%
That's broccoli, cauliflower,
kale, cabbage, onions, garlic,

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.410 align:middle line:84%
peppers, spinach,
all that good stuff.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds good.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Making me hungry.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Just the amazing giant salad.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.850 align:middle line:84%
We shared one at
Jason's Deli recently.

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Just a giant salad full of
all this really amazing food

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.730 align:middle line:84%
from the earth that
was put here for us,

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:30.859 align:middle line:90%
and I had that twice a day.

00:45:30.859 --> 00:45:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
make fruit smoothies

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.890 align:middle line:84%
with a fresh
coconut and berries.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Two cups of blueberries,
blackberries, raspberries,

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:38.400 align:middle line:90%
strawberries.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Berries are very potent
anti-cancer fruits.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:43.920 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.180 align:middle line:90%
That was the daily diet.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was every day, and
I did that for 90 days.

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.240 align:middle line:84%
It was 100% raw
food for 90 days.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What does an anti-cancer
diet look like in your office?

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we teach our patients--

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm not the nutritionist,
but I do instruct patients.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:04.920 align:middle line:10%
First of all, you
have to eat foods--

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.650 align:middle line:10%
mostly vegetables.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't care if they
eat fruits, but you

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:10%
have to eat a low sugar diet
because cancer feeds off

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.840 align:middle line:10%
of sugar.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Otto Warburg
won a Nobel Prize.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.600 align:middle line:84%
He said that cancer cells
thrive in a fermentative energy

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.990 align:middle line:90%
source, which is sugar.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.210 align:middle line:84%
On the cancer cells, the
receptor sites for sugar,

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.980 align:middle line:90%
that's how we do a PET scan.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.110 align:middle line:84%
When you give a
PET scan, you give

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:34.950 align:middle line:84%
it radiotrace glucose and
the cancer cells light up

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.970 align:middle line:90%
or they don't light up.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And they light up because
they're eating the sugar

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.210 align:middle line:90%
or they don't.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to get
people off sugar.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.040 align:middle line:90%
People are addicted to sugar.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Sugar is a poison, it's a
toxin, and it paralyzes the cell

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:50.210 align:middle line:90%
from doing their job.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:52.085 align:middle line:84%
We have this blood test
called the hemoglobin

00:46:52.085 --> 00:46:56.550 align:middle line:84%
A1c, which is a reflection of
your blood sugar over 90 days.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:58.830 align:middle line:90%
It is an aging marker.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Your body has what they call
glycosylation taking place.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:06.430 align:middle line:84%
We know that at
a certain number,

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:09.240 align:middle line:84%
with the electron
microscopy Johns Hopkins

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.630 align:middle line:84%
has written on this,
that the cells change

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.720 align:middle line:84%
after a hemoglobin
A1c greater than 5.0,

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.210 align:middle line:90%
which is considered ideal.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.070 align:middle line:90%
So you have to get off sugar.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't care how you slice it.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there are people
that can eat sugar

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.940 align:middle line:84%
and they have
great blood sugars.

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, they're blessed,
but most people are not.

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
at the statistics, 70,

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.640 align:middle line:84%
80 million people
are pre-diabetic.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.860 align:middle line:84%
So that means they're already
very increased risk of cancer.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Then you have the diabetics.

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Then if you look
at children, one

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:46.410 align:middle line:84%
in three children after the
year 2000 have diabetes.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:49.530 align:middle line:84%
The complications of
diabetes are everything.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes, your circulation,
your heart, your immune system,

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.600 align:middle line:90%
everything is nonfunctional.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.649 align:middle line:90%
Amputation of limbs.

00:47:56.649 --> 00:47:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Probably that's the number one
reason for amputation of limbs

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:00.382 align:middle line:90%
is from high blood sugar.

00:48:00.382 --> 00:48:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to get off
sugar, and then you've

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:05.034 align:middle line:84%
got to get off the things
that turn into sugar.

00:48:05.034 --> 00:48:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So the things that
turn into sugar

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.340 align:middle line:84%
are bread, rice,
pasta, and potatoes.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It's illogical.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:11.950 align:middle line:10%
Because, you know,
most cancer patients

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:13.710 align:middle line:10%
will say I went for
chemo and the doctor

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.350 align:middle line:10%
and the nurse told me any
calorie is a good calorie.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:18.740 align:middle line:10%
Eat this cake, eat this
cookie, eat this donut.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Just keep the weight on.

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Totally oblivious to the
very well articulated,

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.990 align:middle line:84%
clearly demonstrated biochemical
truths about don't eat

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.780 align:middle line:90%
sugar, don't feed cancer.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not a fan of the current
standard of care for cancer,

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.665 align:middle line:84%
and I can assure you
that most oncologists,

00:48:38.665 --> 00:48:41.366 align:middle line:84%
if they were honest with you,
would say the same thing.

00:48:41.366 --> 00:48:42.990 align:middle line:84%
They might say it's
the best they have,

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.430 align:middle line:90%
but they're not happy with it.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:47.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody's
happy with 2.1% or 2.3%

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.125 align:middle line:84%
benefit over five
years, which is

00:48:49.125 --> 00:48:51.300 align:middle line:84%
what the research
shows chemotherapy

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.770 align:middle line:90%
will give to an adult.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, Dr. Brad Weeks shared
the five year success rate

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.420 align:middle line:90%
of chemotherapy--

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:58.856 align:middle line:90%
2.1%.

00:48:58.856 --> 00:48:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Not very good, is it?

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.417 align:middle line:90%
And what about processed foods?

00:49:01.417 --> 00:49:03.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, the foods
that are on the shelves,

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:04.500 align:middle line:90%
they have 50 plus ingredients.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't pronounce
most of the words.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Should we eat those?

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to
Dr. Rashid Buttar.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Question for you.

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.720 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned earlier
one of the toxicities

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.760 align:middle line:84%
involves the food
toxicities, and you mentioned

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.510 align:middle line:90%
genetically modified foods.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:21.300 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a patient
that's a cancer patient,

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.550 align:middle line:84%
what do you recommend as far
as their diet and whether

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:25.320 align:middle line:84%
or not they should eat
genetically modified foods?

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.950 align:middle line:84%
What kind of cancer diet would
you recommend for somebody

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to, let's say, prevent cancer
as opposed to treat it?

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Just a cancer
preventative type diet.

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:34.874 align:middle line:90%
>> Clean.

00:49:34.874 --> 00:49:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So they should
wash their food?

00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
saying by clean?

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Clean.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.290 align:middle line:10%
As clean as possible, meaning
that it should be organic,

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.092 align:middle line:10%
range fed.

00:49:43.092 --> 00:49:45.300 align:middle line:84%
In my book, "The Nine Steps
to Keep the Doctor Away,"

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I actually specifically
talk about food.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And people have
asked me many times,

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.040 align:middle line:84%
when are you going to write
a more detailed book on food?

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I've actually
got one written on that too,

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:54.850 align:middle line:84%
but I'm never going
to put that out.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I want people to
become empowered rather than

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.460 align:middle line:90%
becoming dependent on a book.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:01.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very,
very simple rule.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:06.050 align:middle line:84%
G stands for God,
M stands for man.

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:90%
If God made it, it's good.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.350 align:middle line:90%
If man made it, it's madness.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Simply follow that rule.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:15.970 align:middle line:84%
So if it's butter and doctor
said don't eat butter,

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:17.680 align:middle line:90%
it's fat, this, that--

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.130 align:middle line:84%
it's not man made,
it's God made.

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Eat it.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:21.250 align:middle line:84%
If it's margarine,
it's man made.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:22.749 align:middle line:84%
Use it for lubrication
in your car's

00:50:22.749 --> 00:50:25.030 align:middle line:84%
axle, but don't use
it for anything else.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:27.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's my general rule.

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:30.690 align:middle line:84%
High protein,
lower carbohydrates

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:33.540 align:middle line:84%
because protein is part of how
the body regenerates itself,

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.640 align:middle line:90%
whereas carbohydrates are fuel.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.610 align:middle line:84%
We have too much fuel
in our diet nowadays.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:41.040 align:middle line:84%
We needed more fuel
when we were more back

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.780 align:middle line:84%
in a paleolithic
ancestry, but that's

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.120 align:middle line:90%
because we had to hunt our food.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't hunt our
hamburgers now,

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.480 align:middle line:84%
and so we don't really
need as much fuel anymore.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So you need more of a
rebuilder protein component

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and you need less of the
carbohydrate fuel component.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So my general rule
is man made, madness.

00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:90%
God made, good.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Eat as clean as you can, meaning
organic, range fed, et cetera.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Fruits, vegetables.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:10.020 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to eat meat,
then eat range fed meat.

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.100 align:middle line:90%
And eat as healthy as possible.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:12.900 align:middle line:90%
And people know.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.190 align:middle line:84%
When you start explaining
that to them, well,

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:15.570 align:middle line:90%
what about reading ingredients?

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Well, read the ingredients.

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:19.311 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do I know what's good
for me and what's bad for me?

00:51:19.311 --> 00:51:20.982 align:middle line:84%
If there's two
things in the food

00:51:20.982 --> 00:51:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that you're eating that you
don't know what they are,

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:25.117 align:middle line:84%
that's enough to say,
I'm not going to eat it.

00:51:25.117 --> 00:51:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I happen to know a little
bit more than the average bear,

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:28.680 align:middle line:84%
so when I'm reading
it, I understand

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.763 align:middle line:90%
some more of those things.

00:51:29.763 --> 00:51:33.510 align:middle line:90%


00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:35.760 align:middle line:84%
If there's EDTA, if it says
ethylenediaminetetraacetic

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.600 align:middle line:84%
acid, I'll still eat
it because that's what

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.506 align:middle line:90%
I infuse into patients anyway.

00:51:39.506 --> 00:51:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a chelator, so I'm
not worried about it.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a preservative.

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.220 align:middle line:84%
My rule for general
people, if you

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.450 align:middle line:84%
don't know more than two
ingredients, don't eat it.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> A whole food, predominantly
plant based diet is

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:52.860 align:middle line:90%
an anti-cancer diet.

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:56.680 align:middle line:10%
There are more
anti-cancer medicines

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:00.610 align:middle line:10%
in a diverse whole food diet
than the cancer industry will

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:03.790 align:middle line:10%
ever come up with, regardless
of how many billions of dollars

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.470 align:middle line:10%
they spend on research.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:08.000 align:middle line:84%
There are anti-cancer
compounds in celery,

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and anti-cancer
compounds in beets,

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:12.880 align:middle line:84%
anti-cancer compounds
in the white stuff

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.860 align:middle line:90%
inside the orange peel.

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.740 align:middle line:84%
When you peel the
orange peeling off,

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.782 align:middle line:84%
you should leave that
white layer on the oranges.

00:52:19.782 --> 00:52:20.581 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:52:20.581 --> 00:52:21.457 align:middle line:90%
>> On the pieces.

00:52:21.457 --> 00:52:22.790 align:middle line:90%
Eat as much of that as possible.

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.490 align:middle line:90%
It's anti-cancer.

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Anti-cancer elements in
red wine and red grapes.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Resveratrol, we talked about.

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Anti-cancer elements
in seeds and nuts.

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:34.130 align:middle line:84%
There's so many that
modern science--

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:37.420 align:middle line:84%
it will take us hundreds
of years to even begin

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:40.840 align:middle line:84%
to understand the anti-cancer
potential that's found

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.250 align:middle line:90%
in a grocery store right now.

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:43.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The other big aha in all of
this is that it gets us back

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:53.164 align:middle line:84%
to the amazing power of a
common sense, whole food diet.

00:52:53.164 --> 00:52:54.580 align:middle line:84%
When you look at,
hey, there might

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.260 align:middle line:84%
be toxins in some
of these foods,

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.760 align:middle line:84%
but if you actually
eat whole foods,

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.557 align:middle line:84%
there are natural
things in there

00:52:59.557 --> 00:53:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that will absorb the
toxins without you even

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:02.830 align:middle line:90%
knowing about it.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So as I have done this research,
what it has really done

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:12.310 align:middle line:84%
is given me more and more
respect for mother nature,

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and more amazement at how nature
achieves balance and protects

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:24.370 align:middle line:84%
your body from toxins in the
environment through things

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that you never
were even aware of.

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:29.107 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who ever knew that
eating strawberries as a kid

00:53:29.107 --> 00:53:30.940 align:middle line:84%
that strawberries were
blocking the mercury?

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.440 align:middle line:84%
>> We just thought
they tasted good.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.640 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe that in 50 years,
we're going to look back

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.880 align:middle line:10%
at food now the way we look
at smoking 50 years ago.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.100 align:middle line:10%
You know, there were
commercials with doctors

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:43.930 align:middle line:10%
with cigarettes in their
hands saying that cigarettes

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:44.730 align:middle line:10%
are good for you.

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And we would all agree
that that's laughable now.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.837 align:middle line:84%
That that's absolute
insanity and criminal.

00:53:50.837 --> 00:53:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
probably what we're

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:54.128 align:middle line:84%
going to be saying
about processed foods,

00:53:54.128 --> 00:53:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and McDonald's, and sodas,
and things like that 50 years

00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:57.620 align:middle line:90%
from now.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.080 align:middle line:84%
How crazy it was
that we'd freely

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.600 align:middle line:84%
put that stuff into
our body and build up

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.816 align:middle line:84%
a level of toxicity probably
similar in some ways

00:54:04.816 --> 00:54:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even
worse in some ways

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:08.810 align:middle line:90%
than from smoking cigarettes.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.106 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with Dr. Sahni.

00:54:10.106 --> 00:54:11.980 align:middle line:84%
The standard American
diet today will one day

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:14.410 align:middle line:84%
be looked upon as ridiculous
as smoking cigarettes,

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:16.507 align:middle line:90%
literally giving us disease.

00:54:16.507 --> 00:54:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it's very
important what goes in.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.556 align:middle line:10%
That means also purifying,
cleaning the water.

00:54:20.556 --> 00:54:22.930 align:middle line:10%
Talk about structuring the
water as well, because there's

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:24.070 align:middle line:10%
an energy to water.

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why homeopathy
is so amazing.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.810 align:middle line:84%
That goes beyond merely
filtering it and cleaning it.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So there are other nuances
to protecting ourselves

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:32.230 align:middle line:90%
from cancer.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.730 align:middle line:84%
There's always
something more to do.

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But at the proverbial
end of the day,

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.694 align:middle line:84%
just do what you have
genuine control over, right?

00:54:39.694 --> 00:54:41.110 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that
which you can't.

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:42.290 align:middle line:90%
That you can turn over to God.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Pray on it.

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But that which you have
control of, we are asked to do.

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:48.640 align:middle line:84%
We can't slack off on that which
we have genuine control over.

00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.784 align:middle line:84%
To choose cleaner foods, to
choose cleaner waters, to not

00:54:51.784 --> 00:54:53.950 align:middle line:84%
do certain things that we
know are self-destructive.

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:55.090 align:middle line:90%
These are within our power.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:56.410 align:middle line:90%
We're asked to do that.

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:59.864 align:middle line:84%
We can't abuse the privilege
of life and say, well, nah,

00:54:59.864 --> 00:55:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that one.

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we have
to take control

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:05.204 align:middle line:84%
over that which we have been
granted and given control over.

00:55:05.204 --> 00:55:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the things that we
have been given control over is

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:10.240 align:middle line:84%
the quality and the
amount of food that we put

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.540 align:middle line:90%
into our mouths.

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.630 align:middle line:84%
This next quick interview
with Dr. Irvin Sahni

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:16.330 align:middle line:84%
is an excellent example
of putting into practice

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:18.894 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge that
you have been given.

00:55:18.894 --> 00:55:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm here in Austin, Texas
tonight with Dr. Irvin Sahni.

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:22.900 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Sahni, thanks
for joining us.

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you look a lot different
than you did about five months

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:26.670 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.020 align:middle line:10%
You were a participant in
"The Quest for the Cures,"

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:30.740 align:middle line:10%
and you shed a lot
of information,

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:34.030 align:middle line:10%
valuable information with us,
but you've lost a lot of weight

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.015 align:middle line:10%
since then.

00:55:35.015 --> 00:55:36.140 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's the goatee.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:36.790 align:middle line:10%
>> The goatee?

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:39.206 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you do have a goatee
that you didn't have before,

00:55:39.206 --> 00:55:42.250 align:middle line:10%
but can you tell us what else
has happened between last May

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.080 align:middle line:10%
and current day?

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.684 align:middle line:84%
The whole project
really inspired me.

00:55:49.684 --> 00:55:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Probably was a little less
than completely satisfied

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:53.808 align:middle line:84%
with the way I looked on
camera, but I was also

00:55:53.808 --> 00:55:56.765 align:middle line:84%
inspired and interested in
improving my overall health,

00:55:56.765 --> 00:55:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and that resulted in some
pretty significant weight loss.

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it I got from
"The Quest for the Cures,"

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and some of it I got from
some research I did on my own.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.467 align:middle line:84%
Primarily some
intermittent fasting.

00:56:06.467 --> 00:56:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> What was it specifically
in "The Quest for the Cures"

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that you learned about
that got you on that road?

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can't remember
which speaker it was,

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:20.230 align:middle line:84%
but I heard about
the ketogenic diet.

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. David Jockers.

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> David Jockers.

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I implemented something
called intermittent fasting.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And that basically,
in my case, I

00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:31.090 align:middle line:84%
chose to use a window
of about six hours.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And that six hours can
slide a little bit,

00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:35.410 align:middle line:84%
but for me, it was
between noon and 6:00.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I would only eat
between 12:00 and 6:00,

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and outside that,
I only drank water.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.596 align:middle line:10%
Now, conceptually separate
from that, I also minimized--

00:56:45.596 --> 00:56:47.470 align:middle line:10%
eliminate is probably
a little too difficult,

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:50.950 align:middle line:10%
but I minimized dramatically
carbohydrates, sugars

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.700 align:middle line:10%
and carbohydrates, from my diet
down to about 25 grams a day,

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.360 align:middle line:10%
in some cases even
15 grams a day.

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's pretty tough if
you're eating some vegetables

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.000 align:middle line:90%
to go much lower than that.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what's the purpose in
eliminating the carbohydrates?

00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:07.377 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, carbohydrates
have a number of effects,

00:57:07.377 --> 00:57:09.460 align:middle line:10%
and I think some of this
was covered in "The Quest

00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:11.510 align:middle line:10%
for the Cures," but it
spikes your insulin.

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And so when you get
up in the morning

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.585 align:middle line:84%
and you have a big bowl of
cereal, you spike your insulin,

00:57:16.585 --> 00:57:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and then you're hungry as your
insulin comes back down very

00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:21.120 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So you have a bowl of Froot
Loops at 8:00 in the morning,

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and now you're ready for
lunch by 10:30 or 11:00.

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And that has a lot to
do with the insulin.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Sugar has an addictive
effect for some people.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.720 align:middle line:84%
It makes them want
to keep eating.

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
I did is I also

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.820 align:middle line:90%
eliminated gluten from my diet.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So I eliminated any form
of wheat, breads, pasta,

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:43.620 align:middle line:90%
any form of wheat.

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:45.200 align:middle line:90%
And I don't eat rice either.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.680 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I wasn't
eating much rice either.

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So I eliminated
carbohydrates, sugar,

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and went on an
intermittent fasting diet.

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually
exercise because I

00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:84%
wanted to separate
diet from exercise

00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.970 align:middle line:84%
so I could sort of figure
out how much I could eat

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:03.960 align:middle line:84%
or the way I could eat in
the absence of exercise.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And now, of course,
I've added exercise in

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.810 align:middle line:84%
for the last couple
of months and seeing

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:09.310 align:middle line:90%
even more dramatic effects.

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:10.560 align:middle line:90%
But I've lost about 50 pounds.

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> 50 pounds, which is like
a third to a half of a normal

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:14.740 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lot.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot.

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Had a big drop in my body
fat, increase in my energy,

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.270 align:middle line:84%
look better, feel
better, and I think

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I've also increased my insulin
and leptin sensitivity.

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.120 align:middle line:90%
I probably was pre-diabetic.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that for sure, but
I imagine that I probably was.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, of course,
I was overweight.

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I think also there's
obviously benefits for cancer.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:44.140 align:middle line:10%
Cancer prevention,
boosting my immune system,

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:46.900 align:middle line:10%
and also reversing any
sort of inflammatory.

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Sugar is very inflammatory.

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:52.479 align:middle line:84%
So I reduced my
propensity to have

00:58:52.479 --> 00:58:54.770 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different diseases,
including cardiac disease.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:57.400 align:middle line:10%
And so I believe now
after the research

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.010 align:middle line:10%
that I've done that
cholesterol is not

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:01.570 align:middle line:10%
the major issue in
cardiac disease.

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.402 align:middle line:84%
It is an issue, but
I think sugar is

00:59:03.402 --> 00:59:04.610 align:middle line:90%
an even more important issue.

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:07.750 align:middle line:10%
So I think your cholesterol is--

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:09.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying that
it's not important,

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:12.180 align:middle line:10%
but when you minimize or
eliminate sugar for your diet,

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.920 align:middle line:10%
the cholesterol becomes
much less of an issue.

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So you, a medical doctor,
learned from "The Quest

00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:19.890 align:middle line:84%
for the Cures," you
implemented that knowledge,

00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and now you lost 50 pounds.

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:23.451 align:middle line:84%
And you're my college
roommate, so you look

00:59:23.451 --> 00:59:24.700 align:middle line:90%
as good as you did in college.

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Just as healthy as
you did in college.

00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.236 align:middle line:84%
>> It's great to
see you this way.

00:59:28.236 --> 00:59:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It's great to see
you healthy again.

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And I really appreciate
you joining us tonight

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:32.380 align:middle line:90%
to share your story.

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:33.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks a lot.

00:59:33.245 --> 00:59:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:40.950 align:middle line:84%
That's an amazingly powerful
story from Dr. Irvin Sahni.

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:43.150 align:middle line:84%
"The Quest for the
Cures" back in the spring

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:46.176 align:middle line:84%
influenced him to such an
extent, a medical doctor,

00:59:46.176 --> 00:59:47.550 align:middle line:84%
that he totally
changed his diet,

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.910 align:middle line:90%
and now he's lost 50 pounds.

00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And I went to college
with Dr. Sahni.

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:55.220 align:middle line:84%
He looks as good as he did back
in college, maybe even better.

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:57.250 align:middle line:90%
So what a great story to hear.

00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:59.050 align:middle line:84%
What a great,
encouraging story for you

00:59:59.050 --> 01:00:01.870 align:middle line:84%
because you now understand,
coming from a medical doctor's

01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:04.090 align:middle line:84%
story, that you
are what you eat.

01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that certain
of the diagnostics that

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.790 align:middle line:84%
are used today to detect
cancer actually cause cancer?

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:12.610 align:middle line:84%
They increase your
risk of cancer.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you know which
tests are good?

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:15.762 align:middle line:90%
Which tests are bad?

01:00:15.762 --> 01:00:18.220 align:middle line:84%
There are many tests that are
noninvasive tests that do not

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.910 align:middle line:90%
increase your risk of cancer.

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:21.730 align:middle line:90%
But many of them, as I said, do.

01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow night, you're going
to learn which ones do.

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:25.180 align:middle line:84%
You're going to learn
about the good tests

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
learn about the tests

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:27.850 align:middle line:90%
that you should stay away from.

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
we're going to begin

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.376 align:middle line:84%
to teach you about natural
treatments for cancer.

01:00:32.376 --> 01:00:34.750 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, there
are so many natural treatments

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
for cancer that the
next three episodes

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.326 align:middle line:90%
are dedicated to that topic.

01:00:38.326 --> 01:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I hope you learned
a lot tonight.

01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.116 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're going to
learn a lot in tomorrow night's

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.484 align:middle line:84%
episode, so I hope to see
you back tomorrow night.

01:00:44.484 --> 01:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, enjoy your
evening and God bless you all.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.281 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:00:50.281 --> 01:00:58.010 align:middle line:90%


01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:59.299 align:middle line:90%
Well, Marlon Glenn, my friend.

01:00:59.299 --> 01:01:01.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm so excited to be able
to talk to you tonight.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.006 align:middle line:10%
We're here outside
of Detroit, Michigan.

01:01:03.006 --> 01:01:04.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Welcome to Detroit, Ty.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:05.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you so much.

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:06.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm so glad to be able
to wear this shirt.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.251 align:middle line:10%
I told you a little story about
almost losing the clothes.

01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I told you I had to
apologize on behalf of Detroit.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I wanted your first experience
to be a good one, not luggage

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:15.799 align:middle line:90%
loss.

01:01:15.799 --> 01:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%
>> It has been good thus far.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
But I'm so excited to be
able to talk to you tonight.

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.230 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to do
with you, Marlon,

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:23.120 align:middle line:90%
is get your perspective.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:23.920 align:middle line:90%
You're a teacher--

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, sir.

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> --in a local
junior high school.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.194 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know based upon
your past experience that

01:01:29.194 --> 01:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
you've told me that you are
trying to really help the kids

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:32.490 align:middle line:90%
clean up their diets.

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true, Ty.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> To be healthy through food.

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:37.368 align:middle line:84%
>> And so one of the things
that we focus on here with "The

01:01:37.368 --> 01:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Truth About Cancer: The Quest
for the Cures Continues,"

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.170 align:middle line:84%
is we're trying to teach people
how to eat well, eat clean.

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> To help them to realize
the impact nutrition has

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.470 align:middle line:90%
on their overall health.

01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to do that
as well in your school system.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little about
you and your family.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.590 align:middle line:84%
You've got a
beautiful family here.

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Can't see them on camera, but
they're watching us right now.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And tell us about your family
and about what you're trying

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:01.250 align:middle line:90%
to do to help kids be healthy.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Ty, a few
years ago, my sister,

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:05.510 align:middle line:90%
she passed away.

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:08.150 align:middle line:90%
She had an aneurysm.

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:09.289 align:middle line:90%
She was only 37 years old.

01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and I, it just
kind of threw us for a loop.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
one of your siblings

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:14.281 align:middle line:84%
who's younger than
you when she dies,

01:02:14.281 --> 01:02:16.226 align:middle line:84%
it kind of makes you
contemplate things.

01:02:16.226 --> 01:02:17.642 align:middle line:84%
You kind of think
about, you know,

01:02:17.642 --> 01:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
maybe I need to do a better
job of taking care of myself.

01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So I just jumped
headlong into it.

01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.120 align:middle line:90%
I changed everything.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.600 align:middle line:84%
I probably changed too
much too fast for my wife

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.040 align:middle line:90%
because I got a little pushback.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.540 align:middle line:84%
When you change
everything, you stop

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
the McDonald's, the fast
food, the whole thing,

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:33.420 align:middle line:90%
the kids were like, what?

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.220 align:middle line:90%
You serious?

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
We can't eat these
things anymore?

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.379 align:middle line:84%
But I was serious because my
mind had been made up about it.

01:02:39.379 --> 01:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And as a father, and you're
a father as well, Ty,

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
you know how important it is
for us to lead our families.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I have two daughters, I
have a son, I have my wife,

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm accountable for
what we bring into the home

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.270 align:middle line:90%
and for what we do.

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So I took that
responsibility seriously.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.536 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, well, if I'm
going to embrace this change,

01:02:55.536 --> 01:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
it can't just be about
letting Marlon be healthy.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.860 align:middle line:84%
I have to let the whole
family be healthy.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And then I take that same
mindset into the schools.

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:05.600 align:middle line:10%
I work in urban districts.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.500 align:middle line:10%
And in those districts, they're
known for very poor eating

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.300 align:middle line:10%
habits.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.675 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you can
see people coming

01:03:10.675 --> 01:03:13.280 align:middle line:10%
in first thing in the morning,
Ty, you see hot Cheetos,

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.970 align:middle line:10%
you see Twinkies, cupcakes,
and this is breakfast.

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:19.179 align:middle line:84%
You know, they'll have a
full two liter Mountain Dew,

01:03:19.179 --> 01:03:20.886 align:middle line:84%
and that's what they're
eating and that's

01:03:20.886 --> 01:03:22.040 align:middle line:90%
what they're drinking.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, I
can't just watch them do this

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and not say anything.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
You can't just educate
the mind and not

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
educate the entire
body, the whole sphere

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.372 align:middle line:90%
with what's going on.

01:03:31.372 --> 01:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So I told them one day, I said,
look, I'm going to tell you

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
what, what are you eating there?

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Oh, these are hot
Cheetos, Mr. Glenn.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.400 align:middle line:90%
This is so good.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.360 align:middle line:90%
It's good.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you pronounce
what it's made out of?

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.100 align:middle line:84%
if you can pronounce
every ingredient

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.940 align:middle line:84%
on the back of this bag,
the next bag is on me.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:48.740 align:middle line:90%
Nobody could do it.

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Nobody could pronounce it.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Got about 50 ingredients.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The mindset
has to be changed.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.160 align:middle line:84%
You and Robert have all said,
we have to start with that mind.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Changing how we look at things
and changing how we react.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.840 align:middle line:84%
At another school,
I had a health fair.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing
is, Ty, if you say

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:11.120 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have basketball
tournament, everybody comes.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.779 align:middle line:84%
If it's a sporting
event, everybody's there.

01:04:13.779 --> 01:04:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want to
have a health fair.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Initially, I got
resistance because people

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.830 align:middle line:90%
are thinking, health?

01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Health fair?

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Who wants to come to that?

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.240 align:middle line:90%
That sounds boring.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.734 align:middle line:90%
It's unimaginative.

01:04:25.734 --> 01:04:26.650 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants to do it.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
It was the most attended
event of the school year.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It really was.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.396 align:middle line:84%
Because I got behind it, I found
people who shared a vision.

01:04:34.396 --> 01:04:35.770 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing when
you have people

01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:38.560 align:middle line:84%
who share your vision
of a better life

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.090 align:middle line:84%
because at it's core,
everybody wants a better life,

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:44.342 align:middle line:84%
but they may not
understand how to get it.

01:04:44.342 --> 01:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have to get
beyond that marketing.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.710 align:middle line:84%
It's been my mission
to try and help people.

01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:50.656 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying I'm an
expert on anything.

01:04:50.656 --> 01:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying I
know everything.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I do know, I'm
willing to share that.

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I want you to share--

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
this is something that really
impressed me a couple of years

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
ago when we first
met in Chicago.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Tell the story about
when you gave your kids

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.820 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity,
the choice, do they

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.600 align:middle line:84%
want to go to learn more
about their bodies and health

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.350 align:middle line:84%
at the health convention, or do
they want to go to Disneyland?

01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Very well.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.450 align:middle line:90%
You know, we always listen--

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I discovered Robert
Scott Bell just kind of,

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, you surf on the web
and one link leads to another

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.103 align:middle line:84%
and one thing leads
to something else.

01:05:21.103 --> 01:05:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So I found Robert.

01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So listened to his
show, loved it.

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Downloaded all of his podcasts.

01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the kids
went to school with me.

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So we drive to
school every morning

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:30.901 align:middle line:84%
and they're listening
to Robert Scott Bell.

01:05:30.901 --> 01:05:32.660 align:middle line:10%
And we know that you
came on on Wednesday,

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.790 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Buttar was on Monday,
Dr. Frank King was on Friday.

01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:37.150 align:middle line:10%
They knew the schedule.

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:39.220 align:middle line:10%
So as we're driving, you
know, summertime comes

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.800 align:middle line:10%
and my wife is saying, you
know, what's our family trip?

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.300 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
My aunt in North Carolina,
they always go to Disney,

01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:46.990 align:middle line:90%
want to go to Disney.

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:48.310 align:middle line:90%
You know, kids want to go.

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:49.327 align:middle line:90%
Wife, she's hyped.

01:05:49.327 --> 01:05:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we're going to Disney.

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:51.810 align:middle line:90%
We're going to Disney.

01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the calendar
and said, wait a minute.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the same time
as the health fair.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.220 align:middle line:84%
She looked at me, Ty,
she said, health fair?

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Health fair?

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.410 align:middle line:90%
We're going to the health fair?

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:03.610 align:middle line:90%
She was mad.

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:04.780 align:middle line:90%
She was hot.

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I told the kids, I said,
what do you all want to do?

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.170 align:middle line:90%
I just laid it out there, Ty.

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:08.080 align:middle line:90%
I didn't coerce them.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
because I was the dad,

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:10.960 align:middle line:90%
they may have been intimidated.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But I said, what do
you all want to do?

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:13.750 align:middle line:84%
You all want to go
to Disney, or you

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:14.890 align:middle line:90%
want to go to the health fair?

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we got to go
to the health fair!

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.960 align:middle line:90%
We got to go to the health fair!

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The first thing they said,
will we see Robert Scott Bell?

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.510 align:middle line:90%
He'll be there.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah!

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.253 align:middle line:90%
We got to go to the health fair!

01:06:22.253 --> 01:06:23.500 align:middle line:90%
Got to go to the health fair!

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.439 align:middle line:84%
My wife, at first when we
got there, Ty, she was hot.

01:06:26.439 --> 01:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
She was so mad I don't
think she even spoke

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:30.010 align:middle line:90%
to me when we were down there.

01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Didn't speak to me.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.627 align:middle line:84%
But as time went on, she kind
of-- when she met Robert,

01:06:33.627 --> 01:06:35.710 align:middle line:84%
the kids met Robert, it
was an amazing experience.

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
He was teaching and I
just tapped him and said,

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're really
big fans of yours.

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:39.930 align:middle line:90%
The kids love you.

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
He embraced us, you embraced us,
and I think that broke the ice.

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:46.810 align:middle line:84%
The energy of what this
does is so powerful.

01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
When you get around like
minded individuals who

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.120 align:middle line:84%
all are striving
towards the same thing,

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.710 align:middle line:90%
it's transformational.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even something you
can even compare to a Disney.

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:57.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Disney is transient.

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.150 align:middle line:90%
You go, you ride, and it's done.

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But this is a life
experience, a life journey.

01:07:03.850 --> 01:07:06.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, as I reflect
back on going to Chicago

01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
for the first time, we look back
and say, look where we started

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.277 align:middle line:90%
and look where we are now.

01:07:11.277 --> 01:07:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Having met you guys,
you know, these are now

01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:16.720 align:middle line:84%
lifelong relationships
with a common goal,

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
forward from there.

01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's really impressive.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm glad you shared
that because I wanted

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.580 align:middle line:84%
to show the listeners here, the
viewers of this "Truth About

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Cancer" series that you've don't
have to be a medical doctor.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to
be a full time researcher

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.440 align:middle line:90%
to make changes.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>> You are impacting the lives
of your children, your family,

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.067 align:middle line:84%
the children that you teach
at the school that you teach

01:07:43.067 --> 01:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
at, and you are on a
mission to help educate.

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of our goals
with "The Quest for the Cures"

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.850 align:middle line:84%
is to educate the masses about
cancer, about nutrition, about

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:53.770 align:middle line:84%
the way that you can
take control of your life

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:54.920 align:middle line:90%
and live a healthier life.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So we share the same
mission, brother.

01:07:56.780 --> 01:07:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we were in
Asheville, North Carolina,

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:01.430 align:middle line:84%
you said we change
one mind at a time.

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
We change one mind, they change
a mind, they change a mind.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.810 align:middle line:90%
One step at a time.

01:08:05.810 --> 01:08:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, Marlon, it's been great.

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate you taking
the time tonight.

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Again, welcome to Detroit.

01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:12.460 align:middle line:84%
I hope the rest of the trip
is pretty good for you, Ty.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's going to be good because
we're going to leave from here,

01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go down to Whole
Foods and get some organic

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:16.580 align:middle line:90%
food.

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.439 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds like a plan, buddy.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, brother.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Take care.

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Likewise.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
