00:00:11.688 --> 00:00:18.277 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.277 --> 00:00:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome back, everyone.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.943 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that you tuned back
in to "The Quest for the Cures

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Continues" tonight.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:90%
In last night's episode--

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I hope you were watching-- we
got some powerful information

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that
you are what you eat,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and the importance
of good nutrition.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end we got
a very important testimonial

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:84%
from Dr. Irvin Sahni, who
actually applied the knowledge

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that he learned in the
last "Quest for the Cures,"

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:90%
and dropped 50 pounds.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.779 align:middle line:84%
He's a healthier man
today because of it.

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that some
of the knowledge

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
that you gained
last night you're

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.226 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to use
and apply in your own life.

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Now tonight's
episode, I'm really

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:84%
excited about this
episode because we

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.730 align:middle line:84%
are going to learn about
diagnostics and treatments

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.191 align:middle line:90%
for cancer.

00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
What would you feel
like if you went

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to a restaurant and the
only thing on the menu

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:84%
was the French fries,
and the chicken nuggets,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:90%
and the burgers?

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.518 align:middle line:84%
They left off all the
good stuff for you.

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:08.040 align:middle line:84%
They left off the salad, and
the fruit, and the salmon.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:84%
That's really what's going
on with conventional cancer

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:90%
treatments.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So you go in, you're
diagnosed with cancer,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.960 align:middle line:90%
what do you have as an option?

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:84%
You've got the chemo,
radiation, and surgery.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to learn
about the other natural things

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.863 align:middle line:84%
that are actually
better for you, that

00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
might heal your cancer
quicker and with less side

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.909 align:middle line:90%
effects than the big three.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
talking about here,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're
going to learn tonight.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.989 align:middle line:84%
We're going to teach you
some of these natural cancer

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
treatments that don't have
the side effects, that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
are more effective than
what we call the big three.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
The first interview
tonight is Dr. Ben Johnson.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dr. Johnson was
the only medical doctor

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.106 align:middle line:84%
that was included in the
bestselling movie "The Secret."

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And he has a lot
to share with us

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
in this first clip
about mammograms,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:84%
the number one breast
cancer detection method,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.662 align:middle line:84%
and how they actually
cause cancer.

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And then he shares some
alternatives for those of you

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.828 align:middle line:90%
that want to be tested.

00:01:55.828 --> 00:01:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we're not saying you
shouldn't be tested for cancer.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
What we're saying is
that a lot of the tests

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.666 align:middle line:90%
actually cause cancer.

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:84%
You're going to learn a lot
from Dr. Johnson's interview.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.594 align:middle line:90%
So enjoy the show.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:11.073 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:16.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:10%
>> We, as a medical society, are
giving women breast cancer with

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:10%
our demanding that
they get mammograms.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:10%
Mammograms cause
breast cancer, period.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:10%
So mammograms are not
healthy for women.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.180 align:middle line:10%
Women should not be
getting routine mammograms.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:10%
That's crystal clear,
published in the peer reviewed

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.020 align:middle line:10%
literature.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And yet, today, if a woman went
to her gynecologist, her family

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
doc, she would have this shoved
down her throat-- extreme

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.250 align:middle line:84%
coercion to go get
this mammogram that's

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:90%
causing breast cancer.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not saving lives.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
You have a 4% increased risk
of dying if you get mammograms.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So the detection
technique that we're using--

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:84%
the primary technique that we
use to detect breast cancer--

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:90%
is causing breast cancer.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a terrible test--

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, smashing
women's breasts

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and then irradiating with
cancer-causing radiation.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:90%
And then it's so insensitive.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:10%
For women under 50, it's
only like 52% effective--

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:10%
sensitive.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:10%
That means-- 52 is pretty
close to 50, right?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.709 align:middle line:10%
So about half.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:10%
That means that half the
women that have breast cancer,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:10%
it would not detect
their cancer.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:10%
That's a terrible test.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:10%
And so there are
much better tests,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:10%
and yet this is what's
still being crammed

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.020 align:middle line:10%
down women's throats today.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:90%
Terrible test.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Causes breast cancer.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.464 align:middle line:84%
>> And it doesn't detect-- it
detects 50% and causes cancer.

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
You said there are
better options.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:84%
What better options are there
for detecting breast cancer?

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> There's two better options.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.520 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a lump, if you
think you've got something,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:90%
ultrasound is great.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a test of anatomy.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Mammograms are tests of anatomy.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Ultrasounds are
tests of anatomy.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:90%
MRIs are tests of anatomy.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:84%
So if you've already
got a lump, you

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:90%
want to have a test of anatomy.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So that would be an ultrasound,
because they can see the lump,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:84%
they can see its
consistency, they

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
can see whether
there's calcium in it.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And they can look at blood
flow, because tumors are going

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:90%
to have increased blood flow.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance, the
sensitivity of ultrasound

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:90%
is up around 80%.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:84%
It's much higher
than mammograms.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:10%
And the sensitivity
is higher, too.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.650 align:middle line:10%
But if you're looking
about prevention,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:10%
if you're talking
about screening,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:10%
there's really only
one device out there,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:10%
and that is thermography--
an infrared thermal camera.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:10%
Nothing touches the lady.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:10%
Nothing smashes her breast.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:10%
There's no
cancer-causing radiation.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:10%
As we sit here, we
are emitting heat

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:10%
in the spectrum called infrared.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.150 align:middle line:10%
There's infrared,
visual, and ultraviolet.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.680 align:middle line:10%
So this is the infrared
spectrum of light,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:10%
which our eyes don't
see, but which is

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:10%
very detectable by the cancer.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:10%
The military developed
this so that they

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:10%
could see people sneaking
at them at nighttime,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.147 align:middle line:10%
and so that they could shoot
down missiles and things,

00:05:26.147 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:10%
because they are producing heat.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Like the night vision goggles.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Night vision goggles
are infrared goggles.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:10%
So we use this as a
medical application

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:10%
to detect hot spots
in the breast.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, long before there
was a tumor there,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:10%
there were cancer cells.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:10%
Probably eight to 10 years
before there was a tumor,

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:10%
there were cancer cells
starting to grow--

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.510 align:middle line:10%
two cells, four cells, 16
cells, 144 cells, et cetera,

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And it takes about
eight years until you

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:84%
get to about a sonometer
in size for a mammogram

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:90%
or an ultrasound to detect it.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's too late, because
that one sonometer tumor--

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:84%
about 5/16 of an inch,
less than half an inch--

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:90%
is about one billion cells.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:10%
When you get to
one billion cells,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:10%
the cancer has already eroded
into the lymphatic system

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:10%
and the venous system,
and its shedding cancer

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:10%
cells all through the body.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:10%
So that's why mammograms-- one
of the many reasons mammograms

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:10%
don't save lives-- it
is not early detection.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:10%
And that's one of
the little lies

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:10%
they've propagated along--
early detection saves lives.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:10%
Get your mammogram today.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that statement's true--

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:10%
early detection does save lives.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:10%
It's just that mammography
is not early detection.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.720 align:middle line:10%
It's too late.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.600 align:middle line:10%
And then the
cancer-causing radiation--

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:10%
so the long and
the short is you're

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:10%
causing much more breast
cancer with mammograms

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:10%
than you are detecting.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.470 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:10%
So you mentioned
early detection--

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:10%
the phrase that you hear
all month this month--

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:10%
October 2014-- early detection
is your best protection.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Thermography is the
only early detection

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:10%
because, as years before
that became a tumor,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:10%
those cells were growing,
and growing, growing.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:10%
They were increasing
their blood supply.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are dying
off, creating nitrous oxide

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and other debris that
dilates the blood vessels

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.100 align:middle line:90%
and skin above it.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So that reflects as a heat
pattern on the thermogram.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So thermograms are the only
early detection out there.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:84%
That's because thermography
is a test of physiology.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.570 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at what's
happening in the breast,

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the other
tests are anatomy.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Something already has
to be big enough to see.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:84%
When it's big enough to see,
it's virtually too late.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's already
beginning to spread.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So you hear all
month this month,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.512 align:middle line:84%
it's Breast Cancer Awareness
month, about early detection.

00:08:12.512 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You're saying they should
be using thermography

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.520 align:middle line:90%
instead of mammography.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a better early
detection technique.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Why, in your opinion,
are they not using it

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.420 align:middle line:90%
if it works so much better?

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there are things
that you just want to shoot

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
yourself over that the medical
standard medicine does not

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not much of a conspiracy
theory type person,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.240 align:middle line:84%
but I've come to believe
that American medicine is not

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.179 align:middle line:90%
about helping people get well.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It's about managing
disease, and selling drugs,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
and creating money through the
paradigm of patient treatment.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:90%
So you can't talk about cure.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:84%
You can't look at getting
people well from cancer.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:84%
They just want to treat them
and then watch them die.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It's really a pretty
pathetic state of affairs.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Mammography releases ionizing
radiation that causes genetic

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:10%
mutations in your body's cells.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:10%
And if you get
enough mammograms,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.070 align:middle line:10%
eventually they
will find cancer,

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:10%
because the mammograms
cause the cancer.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was Dr. Russell
Blaylock a few years ago

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
came out with a study that each
mammogram increases the woman's

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:90%
risk of cancer about 2%.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at the
period from the age of 40

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:84%
to the age of 50, women are now,
by the American Cancer Society,

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:84%
recommended to start getting
their mammograms at 40.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.130 align:middle line:84%
To the age of 50, that's
10 years times 2%.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Their risk is increased by 20%.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And a recent study that
just was released last year

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
showed that mammograms
from the age of 40 to 50

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:90%
do not help detect cancer.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.602 align:middle line:84%
The ACS knows that,
but they have not

00:09:55.602 --> 00:09:56.810 align:middle line:90%
changed their recommendation.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Because mammography is
the recruitment method

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:90%
for the cancer industry.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
The cancer industry is
a multi-billion dollar

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:90%
for-profit industry.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who thinks that the
cancer industry is primarily

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:15.010 align:middle line:84%
motivated by compassionate
love for women's health

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:90%
is kidding themselves.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.760 align:middle line:84%
This is an industry that
is insidiously engaged

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
in routine systemic
censorship of information

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
about natural cancer cures,
treatments, and prevention

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:90%
methodologies that really work.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:84%
This is an industry
that uses mammography

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.470 align:middle line:84%
as a way to scare women,
to use fear-based tactics,

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.290 align:middle line:84%
fear medicine, into
receiving treatments

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that most of the time are not
necessary and don't help them.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>> What is tamoxifen?

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:10%
So on a cancer cell--

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:10%
especially a breast cancer
cell-- it has receptor sites.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:10%
Tens of thousands,
maybe hundreds

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:10%
of thousands of receptor sites.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
receptor sites are

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
for estrogen. And
so tamoxifen is

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
a drug that hooks to the
estrogen receptor site

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.780 align:middle line:90%
and occupies it.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, you want that
site occupied.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:10%
There are three natural
female estrogens--

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:10%
estrone, estriol, and
estradiol-- estradiol

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:10%
being the more potent,
naturally cancer-causing one.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:10%
So you want to occupy that
receptor site to keep estradiol

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.170 align:middle line:10%
from docking there, but you
could be giving that patient--

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:10%
and I do give my breast
cancer patients--

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:10%
estriol, a normal hormone
that their body makes

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:10%
and is used to.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:10%
I just give it in abundance
to block those receptor sites.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:10%
You can block those
receptor sites with soy.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:10%
You can block those
receptor sites

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:10%
with many
non-stimulating things.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.360 align:middle line:10%
You want those estrogen
receptor sites blocked,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:10%
but not with tamoxifen.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I know you're
not a conspiracy theorist,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:10%
but nothing better to
create repeat business than

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:10%
to perpetuate the disease
that you're supposedly trying

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:10%
to treat.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Mammograms, tamoxifen,
you've got a built in clientele.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
that patient back.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:90%
They're going to get--

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
if they don't have
breast cancer,

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.187 align:middle line:84%
you take enough mammograms and
they will have breast cancer.

00:12:11.187 --> 00:12:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And you give them
tamoxifen, you know you're

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.451 align:middle line:90%
going to get that patient back.

00:12:14.451 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Good repeat business.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, it's a good
business model.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a good business model if
you don't have very many morals

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.477 align:middle line:90%
or conscience.

00:12:23.477 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>> I see medical students.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:10%
They come and train
in our office.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:10%
They are $200,000
to $300,000 in debt.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:30.487 align:middle line:10%
And what are they
going to do out there?

00:12:30.487 --> 00:12:31.778 align:middle line:90%
Where is the money going to be?

00:12:31.778 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
The money is in
diagnosis and treatment,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately that's
where we've gone with things.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But I always tell people
they should look twice

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.364 align:middle line:84%
before donating to
charities like Komen

00:12:42.364 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Foundation or the American
Cancer Society and really look,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.571 align:middle line:84%
are they really searching
for an underlying

00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
cause of these
problems, or are they

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
just perpetuating the same
old model that's not working?

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
We should be running
for the cause.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:10%
>> This month is October
2014, we've got Breast Cancer

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.070 align:middle line:10%
Awareness Month.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.510 align:middle line:10%
Run for the Cure,
maybe we should

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.460 align:middle line:10%
be running for the prevention.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we absolutely should.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't fault mostly women--
all those women and some men--

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.950 align:middle line:84%
who go out and run and walk
and try and raise money,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.050 align:middle line:84%
because they have issues
like you and I had.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, our parents,
whoever, died of cancer.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.810 align:middle line:10%
So they're trying to raise money
for something that they feel,

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.400 align:middle line:10%
or they've been
told, is the answer.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.055 align:middle line:84%
But talk to those people and
say, why are you doing this?

00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And they'll tell
you the reasons.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And you say, where
does the money go?

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.210 align:middle line:90%
What's the answer?

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The answer is always
cancer research.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:10%
And the fact is that they don't
know where that money goes.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And they need to know.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.630 align:middle line:10%
Because the majority
of that money

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:10%
goes into what I call the
dark, black, sucking hole that

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.780 align:middle line:10%
is called cancer
research, but it's

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.920 align:middle line:10%
never going to be seen
or heard from again--

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.460 align:middle line:10%
those research dollars.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:10%
Why not put it into prevention?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Why not put it into things
that actually work for cancer?

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:10%
Why not have clinical
trials actually

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.000 align:middle line:10%
on foods and supplements?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:10%
But the FDA-- one of
the former FDA directors

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:10%
said, in my tenure, we will
never, ever do a clinical trial

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.070 align:middle line:10%
on a natural substance.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:90%
We won't allow it.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a problem we have
in our country today.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The actual things
that keep us healthy

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and heal us when
we're not healthy

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
are not allowed to see
the light of day, ever.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:10%
And they're not even considered.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
This is what God
put on this planet

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and on this Earth to
prevent these sicknesses

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and diseases that are largely
man-made, and to heal us when,

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and if, we get these
sicknesses and diseases.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet they're given
no consideration today.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Tamoxifen, the top drug
for treating breast cancer,

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:90%
actually causes cancer.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Mammograms cause cancer.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Thermography is a
much better option.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this month is Breast
Cancer Awareness Month,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:84%
but shouldn't we run for the
cause instead of for the cure?

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't we try to prevent
breast cancer instead

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:90%
of continually treating it?

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, I agree with Bob Wright--

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.583 align:middle line:84%
I'm not blaming the good people
that are Running for the Cure.

00:15:04.583 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Those people are out
there doing their best

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:90%
to find an answer to cancer.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, about 80% of
that money that you're donating

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:90%
is not going to research.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Less than 20% of
the money that's

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
donated to these
cancer charities

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:90%
actually goes to research.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.590 align:middle line:84%
It goes to
administrative overhead.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
It goes to the fat cat
salaries of the administrators

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.995 align:middle line:90%
and the board of directors.

00:15:23.995 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It goes to travel and
entertainment expenses,

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:90%
but it does not go to research.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:90%
And what about prostate cancer?

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Is the PSA the best diagnostic
test for prostate cancer?

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:35.537 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out.

00:15:35.537 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The founder of the PSA
test has come up with a couple

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.630 align:middle line:84%
of articles recently saying
that he didn't design that test

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
for everybody to get it to
get diagnosed prostate cancer.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks it's a wrong
therapy that we're doing.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
80% false positives
with the PSA testing.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:10%
So here the American Cancer
Society and the powers that be

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:10%
recommend doing
yearly PSA screenings.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.550 align:middle line:84%
They backed off a little
bit from that recently.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But, basically, they're
recommending yearly PSA testing

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:90%
for men over the age of 50.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
when the PSA elevates--

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.140 align:middle line:84%
which it can elevate from a
lot of reasons besides cancer--

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.520 align:middle line:84%
prostatitis, if the prostate's
been stimulated within 24

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:90%
hours of the blood testing.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Inflammation.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything that
causes inflammation.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they go into the
whole cancer industrial complex

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:84%
themselves, where they're
getting ultrasounds, biopsies,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
chemotherapy,
surgery, radiation.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And most men with
prostate cancer

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.020 align:middle line:84%
can outlive it if they
don't do anything.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
They'll end up dying
of something else.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So we've got a
whole mess on that.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And, again, we need to search
for the underlying cause of why

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.864 align:middle line:90%
one in three men have it.

00:16:41.864 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And we need to certainly
do a lot less therapy

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:90%
on men with prostate cancer.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
We're not saving enough men
for it, and putting way too

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.752 align:middle line:84%
many men through too many toxic
and traumatic therapies for it.

00:16:53.752 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I think the numbers are, if
you're over 80 years old,

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
about 88% of men will
have prostate cancer

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.690 align:middle line:84%
at the time of death
if they do an autopsy.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:90%
3% will die from it.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:90%
8% are affected by it.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.422 align:middle line:84%
The rest are dying
of something else

00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
if they've had prostate care.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> They live with it, and
they may not even know.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We're treating every man
as if that's the same thing,

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.638 align:middle line:90%
and it's just a disaster.

00:17:16.638 --> 00:17:17.480 align:middle line:90%
It's sad.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
80% false positives
with the PSA test.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.624 align:middle line:84%
You go in for chemo,
you go in for radiation,

00:17:24.624 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and they actually
perpetuate the disease

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:84%
that you might have
never even had.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:84%
There's better
options-- the AMAS

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:84%
tests-- stands for
anti-malignin antibody in serum.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.340 align:middle line:84%
The Navarro urine test, which
measures the amount of HCG

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:90%
in the blood.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Those are two very noninvasive
tests, and very effective tests

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:84%
In this next clip,
Dr. Tony Jimenez,

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
as a conventionally
trained medical doctor,

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:84%
shares the story of how
his father was diagnosed

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
with prostate cancer, and how
he went to natural methods

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:51.580 align:middle line:90%
to treat it.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> My dad, who lived in Texas,
developed prostate cancer.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So he went to MD
Anderson, right?

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.034 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, they wanted to
do the surgery, the radiation,

00:18:01.034 --> 00:18:02.200 align:middle line:90%
the Lupron, and all of that.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there has
to be a better way.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
impetus that drove me

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
into seeking better
ways of treating my dad.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:10%
And thankfully, he was cured,
totally free of cancer,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.000 align:middle line:10%
even though he had already
external metastases

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:10%
beyond the prostate to lymph
nodes and a little bit on bone.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:10%
So it was a fabulous
result. Based on that,

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:10%
there was no turning back.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So what treatments did he use
then to turn around this cancer

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:90%
that had already metastasized?

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, back then we used
some intravenous anti-cancer

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.510 align:middle line:10%
therapies, like Poly-MVA,
vitamin C. At that time--

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.770 align:middle line:10%
we're talking 30 years
ago, 25 years ago--

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:10%
we used shark cartilage that was
around, rectally in implants.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.786 align:middle line:84%
And just the different things
that were there at that time.

00:18:52.786 --> 00:18:54.160 align:middle line:10%
Of course, throughout
these years

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:10%
there's been a
lot of advancement

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:10%
not only in treatment, but also
in the knowledge of what really

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.217 align:middle line:10%
are the hallmarks of cancer.

00:19:02.217 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:10%
So when a patient calls
me and they say, Dr. Tony,

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:10%
have you treated osteosarcoma,
or rhabdomyosarcoma,

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:10%
or rare cancers?

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
The answer is always, it's
not about the cancer type,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:84%
it's about treating
the characteristics

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
of cancer, which are
common in all cancers--

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:26.920 align:middle line:84%
such as angiogenesis, blood
flow, increases in vascularity.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
A tumor or mass cannot grow
beyond two millimeters in size

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:90%
without increasing blood flow.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.590 align:middle line:10%
So all the patients
that come to Hope

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:10%
for Cancer, where
they have a tumor,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:10%
let's say, in the breast,
in the liver, prostate,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:10%
we check for blood flow--

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:10%
vascularity.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.310 align:middle line:10%
And we have excellent results
in decreasing blood flow.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:10%
Current statistics
at Hope for Cancer

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:10%
say that within the three
weeks that the patients are

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:57.570 align:middle line:10%
in the clinic, we have an
average of about 45 to 51%

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:10%
decrease in blood
flow to the tumors.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're stopping the
nutrient flow to the tumors.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And the ability of that tumor
to excrete the byproducts

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:90%
of metabolism, the waste.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.724 align:middle line:84%
Which a lot of times,
the toxic waste

00:20:11.724 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
is what will then further
compromise the body.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.108 align:middle line:84%
>> It's funny that you
mention shark cartilage,

00:20:17.108 --> 00:20:19.851 align:middle line:84%
because our mutual
friend, Dr. Rashid Buttar,

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed him for
"The Quest for the Cures."

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
He mentioned that he used to use
shark cartilage in his protocol

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.296 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't anymore
because, as you mentioned,

00:20:28.296 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:90%
things have advanced.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.378 align:middle line:90%
The treatments have advanced.

00:20:30.378 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:90%
But he did 15, 20 years ago.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I put together

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.310 align:middle line:84%
in my 25 years
working in cancer is

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:84%
what we call the seven key
principles to cancer therapy.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:84%
This was actually
recently published, Ty,

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
in a peer-reviewed medical
journal out of UCLA.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
It was amazing, because it's
an alternative mind-frame

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and thought about
how to treat cancer.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And these seven principles
that we adhere to

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:84%
with all of our patients are
nontoxic cancer therapies,

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
stimulating or optimizing
the immune system.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course,
detoxification, nutrition,

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:90%
anti-microbial therapy--

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
we have to realize more and
more that, not only in cancer,

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:90%
but in chronic disease--

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
microbes, whether it's
parasites as Hulda Clark says,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
whether it's fungus, as Dr.
Simoncini says, or viruses,

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.300 align:middle line:84%
or bacteria, play a
key role in the onset

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:84%
or the progression of
cancer and chronic disease.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:84%
The other one, of
course, is having

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.700 align:middle line:84%
to do with the emotional,
biological aspect of disease.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And this we spend
significant amount of time

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
with our patients,
because unless you

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
get at the core root of the
emotional, biological reasons--

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:84%
or these are like the
conflicts, the traumas.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.237 align:middle line:84%
What is the baggage
that we're carrying?

00:21:48.237 --> 00:21:49.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:49.036 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> What are our secrets, right?

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Until we address
that and let them go,

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that's when the true
healing can take place.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, buried
feelings never die.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And we can suppress
it, we can say

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I've put it on the back
burner, but it's always there

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:84%
having an impact on your immune
system and everything else.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And number seven is the oxygen
therapies, or oxygenation.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're well aware
of the reason for why

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:90%
oxygen therapy is so important.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So I say, if we adhere to
these seven key principles,

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
we will have the best
possibility of not only placing

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:84%
a patient, or helping a
patient go into remission,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately affecting
a resolution of disease.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>> You just listed these
seven, and it's amazing

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
the similarities between
those seven and then Dr.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Buttar has the seven toxicities.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> After a lot of
research and dialogue,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe that hyperthermia,
sono-photo dynamic therapy--

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.601 align:middle line:84%
which is another big therapy
that we do at Hope for Cancer.

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:10%
There's actually three clinics
in the world doing sono-photo

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:10%
dynamic therapy--

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:10%
and we're the one with the
most experience in this--

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:10%
using sound and light
to fight cancer cells.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So hyperthermia,
sono-photo dynamic therapy,

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
oxygen therapy, and
our latest addition

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:14.420 align:middle line:84%
to our arsenal at Hope for
Cancer is viral therapy.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.660 align:middle line:90%
And this is called RIGVIR.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.760 align:middle line:10%
You know, maybe in
the news recently,

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.910 align:middle line:10%
Ty, that someone
with multiple myeloma

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:10%
had an injection
with measles vaccine.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were pronounced
cured of multiple myeloma.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.910 align:middle line:84%
So vaccines have
been used in medicine

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:90%
to try to attack cancer.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And Amgen Oncology--
A-M-G-E-N Oncology in the US--

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is in phase three
clinical trials

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
of a genetically
biotechnologically

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:84%
engineered virus that
will attack cancer cells.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But would you ever, or would
I, want to administer this

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves?

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Genetically modified
bioengineered virus?

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:10%
Forget it.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is where viral
therapy in the form of RIGVIR

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:84%
comes into play at
Hope for Cancer.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a virus that
is non-pathogenic--

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.060 align:middle line:84%
meaning it cannot cause
disease in humans.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not genetically
modified, it's a wild strain.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.020 align:middle line:84%
That means it's found in nature
in the healthy gut of children

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.424 align:middle line:90%
between 7 and 11 years of age.

00:24:26.424 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's just part
of your microflora?

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Part of your microflora.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So in the mid '60s, in
the old Soviet Union,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.940 align:middle line:84%
they were really
focusing on viruses.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're the
ones that developed

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
the polio vaccine that's
used all around the world.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So this same team found
a virus, as I just

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
described--
non-pathogenic-- that has

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:90%
two mechanisms of action.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.230 align:middle line:84%
One is it migrates
towards cancer cells.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Scientific word for
that is oncotropism.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.090 align:middle line:90%
A big fancy word.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right?

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:90%
It sounds good.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oncotropism.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So it migrates and
recognizes cancer cells.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.990 align:middle line:84%
The second part of
all this is that it

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:84%
invades the cancer cells,
penetrates it, and causes--

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:90%
a big fancy word-- oncolysis--

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:90%
breaking up of that cancer cell.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So now the viruses migrate,
through oncotropism,

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:90%
and infect other cancer cells.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So it appears that they
are selectively toxic,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:84%
or they head for those cancer
cells like a magnet would.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
big part of all this,

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Ty, is that it has the ability--

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
guess what-- and I'm addressing
your question about the immune

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:90%
system--

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:84%
the RIGVIR virus has
the ability to bind

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:55.090 align:middle line:84%
to those proteins
on the cell surface

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.810 align:middle line:84%
that cloak the cancer cells
from immune recognition.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So now, enhancing the immune
system with whatever we use,

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.862 align:middle line:84%
will have the
effect that we want.

00:26:07.862 --> 00:26:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Because now they can see--

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Now they see it.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when people
hear this, they

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, you're using
a virus, that's bad.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.760 align:middle line:84%
But people don't really
understand sometimes

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.209 align:middle line:90%
that we have--

00:26:17.209 --> 00:26:18.750 align:middle line:84%
there's good viruses
and bad viruses.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
There's good bacteria
and bad bacteria.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So you've got your microflora
has all kinds of good guys

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and bad guys that
are always fighting.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And so you guys are taking
one of the good guys.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.850 align:middle line:10%
>> And it has a natural
propensity to look at cancer

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.190 align:middle line:10%
cells to remove that cloak.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not familiar
with that treatment.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, I wasn't.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Now I am.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.498 align:middle line:90%
>> And guess what, Ty--

00:26:38.498 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:90%
I have six kids.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I would never give
myself something

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:84%
that will be detrimental
to my health, obviously.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the differences
between a healer

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:84%
and an oncologist
or physician, is

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that a healer will give himself
or herself anything that they

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:90%
will prescribe a patient.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.544 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary, 86% of
oncologists polled, or so,

00:27:00.544 --> 00:27:01.960 align:middle line:84%
said they wouldn't
give themselves

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:90%
what they give their patients.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> They would not take
chemo or radiation.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> 86%.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> 86%?

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The other 14%, I think
maybe when they would extend

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.772 align:middle line:84%
their arm and start
the drip of the chemo,

00:27:14.772 --> 00:27:15.730 align:middle line:90%
they will pull it back.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:84%
But, you know-- so I took an
injection of the viral therapy

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:84%
RIGVIR, because I know
it's not pathogenic.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:84%
My dad had prostate
cancer, as I said,

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:84%
so I wanted an
optimal immune system.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I want an immune system
that has the ability

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
to recognize any developing
cancer cells in my body.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
You'll be hearing a lot
more about viral therapy

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.410 align:middle line:90%
in the months and years to come.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The second treatment
that you mentioned--

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:90%
the photo--

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Sono-photo dynamic therapy.

00:27:47.372 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't even say it.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.836 align:middle line:84%
It took me a couple
of months to.

00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you describe
what that is?

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.980 align:middle line:84%
We know in conventional medicine
that photodynamic therapy--

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:00.700 align:middle line:84%
PDT-- has been used for
many, many years and decades

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.030 align:middle line:90%
to treat skin cancers.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.540 align:middle line:84%
You use a sensitizer that's
absorbed by the cancer cells,

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.040 align:middle line:90%
and you use light--

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that's phototherapy It could
be in the form of lasers,

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
it could be in
the form of LEDs--

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.750 align:middle line:84%
light emitting
diodes-- and that's

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:84%
been proven without a doubt
that kills cancer cells.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:10%
And Cancer Treatment Centers
of America, in the US,

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:26.590 align:middle line:10%
they do photodynamic therapy--

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:10%
PDT-- to treat skin cancer,
as I just mentioned,

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:35.740 align:middle line:10%
but they also do it to treat
esophagus and stomach cancer.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Because they do it
through an endoscopy--

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
they put in the laser and target
the esophagus or cancer tumor.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's photodynamic therapy.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Photodynamic therapy has a
depth of penetration limitation,

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:57.100 align:middle line:84%
because, as you know, light
has a penetration limit, right?

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:84%
The thicker the membrane,
the light won't go through.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you're behind a wall
and you shine a light,

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:84%
you can't see it on the
other side of the wall.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why we have
curtains on the window.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why we have
curtains on the window.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:90%
But what about sound, Ty?

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.692 align:middle line:90%
Sound travels much further.

00:29:11.692 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:10%
>> So somewhere
near New York City.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And dolphins love that, right?

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> The sound.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:10%
So we know that sound
travels in water.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.990 align:middle line:10%
If our body is 70%
to 75% water, then we

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.780 align:middle line:10%
can have good effect
of sound therapy.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:10%
This is where the sono part of
this therapy comes together.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:10%
So sono-photo dynamic
therapy is using

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:37.280 align:middle line:10%
sound and light, or photo,
to affect cancer cells.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So the sono part is
we use an ultrasound

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:84%
emitting sound frequencies at
specific amplitude, intensity,

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:90%
wavelength.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And we know that the
substance that is used--

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:57.560 align:middle line:84%
the photo sensitizer-- is
absorbed by cancer cells.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.560 align:middle line:84%
This is a chlorophyll
derivative, so

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.970 align:middle line:90%
totally nontoxic.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Lots of oxygen, too.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:06.215 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells absorb
it 70 to one--

00:30:06.215 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:84%
70 cancer cells for
one normal cell.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.770 align:middle line:84%
We wait 24 hours for
maximum absorption

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:90%
within the cancer cells.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Normal cells, for
some God-given reason,

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.290 align:middle line:84%
will excrete whatever
they absorb--

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:90%
the normal cells will.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So after 24 hours,
the sensitizer--

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:84%
the chlorophyll derivative--
is only absorbed and retained

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:90%
within cancer cells.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:90%
But it does nothing by itself.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.560 align:middle line:10%
It has no physical, chemical,
biochemical, biological action

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:47.850 align:middle line:10%
until we wake it up,
like a sleeping bear.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.320 align:middle line:10%
How do we wake it up?

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:54.600 align:middle line:10%
Using the sound and using the
phototherapy, or light therapy.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Proven, specific frequencies,
intensity, wavelength,

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.460 align:middle line:90%
and amplitude.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.397 align:middle line:10%
Once this happens,
this molecule--

00:31:02.397 --> 00:31:04.480 align:middle line:10%
which, I mean, I don't
want to get too technical--

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.200 align:middle line:10%
but it's a porphyrin
ring molecule.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.557 align:middle line:84%
So it's very known
to the human body.

00:31:11.557 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Because in our blood
we have something

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.300 align:middle line:90%
called hematoporphyrin.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And so this sensitizer--
a chlorophyll derivative--

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:90%
is not foreign to the body.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So at this time, when we do the
sound and the light therapy,

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and the sensitizer is
within the cancer cells,

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.960 align:middle line:90%
now we stimulate its activity.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is to release
oxygen radicals, which

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.310 align:middle line:90%
are toxic to cancer cells.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Every treatment must
take into consideration

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.200 align:middle line:84%
detoxification,
as you well know.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So when patients have side
effects or Herxheimer's

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Reaction, it's because
we're not doing

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.040 align:middle line:84%
or due diligence to
make sure the skin

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:84%
is detoxing the liver,
the kidneys, respiration.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:90%
So detoxing is a must.

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So what processes do you use
to make sure that the patients

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:90%
are detoxified properly?

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> The first thing?

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Nutrition.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Proper nutrition and juicing.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.650 align:middle line:90%
We do coffee enemas.

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Coffee enemas were in
the "Merck Manual"--

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.360 align:middle line:84%
the bible of medicine-- before
any laxative or any detoxer

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:90%
was.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But drugs came into existence,
so coffee is now not

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:22.380 align:middle line:90%
appropriate.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So we use a specific
type of coffee.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.010 align:middle line:90%
So you can't drink this kind.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.810 align:middle line:90%
This is--

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.672 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's dark roast?

00:32:30.672 --> 00:32:31.536 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:32:31.536 --> 00:32:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Folgers dark roast coffee.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It is organic.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Caffeinated, because,
see, coffee enemas

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.580 align:middle line:90%
are not to clean the colon.

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Coffee enemas are to detox
the liver and the gallbladder,

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.230 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.760 align:middle line:90%
So we use a specific coffee.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually it comes
from Canada, and it

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.570 align:middle line:84%
meets certain
characteristics to do that.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's a biggie--

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'm sorry--

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- that's
just two, right?

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Nutrition, juicing,
coffee enemas.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, exercise, lymphatic
drainage formulas, or bouncing

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.150 align:middle line:90%
rebounding.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:13.470 align:middle line:10%
A negative thought can kill
you faster than a bad germ.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:10%
So one of the main things
to detoxify is here--

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The mind.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>> The mind.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.230 align:middle line:84%
The emotions, the
conflicts, the traumas--

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:84%
going back to what
we said earlier.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So detoxing those
psychological, emotional,

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:33.010 align:middle line:84%
biological conflicts
and trauma is key.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we could talk about
other things to detoxify.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:90%
The list is extensive.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.694 align:middle line:84%
But I would say these are
the primary basic ones.

00:33:40.694 --> 00:33:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Those are the keys.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Those are the keys.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So for cancer patients, my big
recommendation is faith in God,

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.250 align:middle line:84%
be strong with your
spiritual aspect

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:84%
of your life, the emotional,
and then the physical.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:57.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, as it was
in the ancient times,

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.940 align:middle line:84%
when someone went to a
Hope for Cancer Institute,

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.360 align:middle line:84%
the first person they saw
was the spiritual advisor.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:84%
The second person they saw was
the emotional, psychological

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:84%
counselor, and then they
saw us, the physicians.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:84%
>> So Dr. Jimenez just
shared with us his seven key

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:13.230 align:middle line:90%
principles in treating cancer.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And in this next clip,
Dr. Rashid Buttar

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:19.110 align:middle line:84%
shares with us what he calls the
seven toxicities that he tries

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:21.480 align:middle line:90%
to remove when treating cancer.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Again, all disease--

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.900 align:middle line:84%
not just cancer--
is a deficiency

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.659 align:middle line:84%
of some type of a nutrient,
or it's a toxicity

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's a result
of the toxicity.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:middle line:84%
It can be a toxicity
plus a deficiency,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.000 align:middle line:90%
or it can just be the toxicity.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.739 align:middle line:84%
But if you can address
those two things,

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.120 align:middle line:84%
then you've got a chance
of actually resolving

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:37.920 align:middle line:90%
the situation.

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And of those toxicities,
we have defined

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.107 align:middle line:90%
seven different toxicities.

00:34:41.107 --> 00:34:42.690 align:middle line:10%
The seven toxicities
are heavy metals,

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.835 align:middle line:10%
the second one is persistent
organic pollutants,

00:34:44.835 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:10%
the third one is
opportunistics-- the bacteria,

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.203 align:middle line:10%
virus, spirochetes, mycoplasma,
yeast, those types of things--

00:34:49.203 --> 00:34:55.586 align:middle line:10%
meaning something that needs
an opportunity to set up house.

00:34:55.586 --> 00:34:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeast, for example,
a fungus, would not

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.017 align:middle line:84%
affect you unless you're
immunocompromised.

00:34:59.017 --> 00:35:00.600 align:middle line:84%
So the first toxicity--
heavy metals--

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.520 align:middle line:84%
or the second toxicity--
persistent organic pollutants,

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.436 align:middle line:84%
or chemicals-- will
suppress the immune system

00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:07.184 align:middle line:84%
that allows for that
third toxicity--

00:35:07.184 --> 00:35:09.100 align:middle line:84%
the opportunistics-- to
actually set up house.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Then the fourth, fifth,
sixth, and seventh toxicities,

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.030 align:middle line:84%
they're a little
bit more esoteric.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.450 align:middle line:90%
The fourth one is energetics--

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, cell phone radiation,
electromagnetic radiation,

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:90%
that type of stuff.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:84%
The fifth one,
emotional, psychological.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Sixth one, food.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Not what is in the food we eat,
but what's done to the food--

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.220 align:middle line:84%
the genetic modification, the
irradiation, homogenisation,

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.727 align:middle line:84%
pasteurization,
that type of stuff.

00:35:28.727 --> 00:35:30.310 align:middle line:84%
And then the seventh
one is spiritual.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I've read about
your cancer protocol,

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and you have something
that you call AARSOTA.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
what your AARSOTA is.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it a vaccine?

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.410 align:middle line:90%
What is AARSOTA?

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>> AARSOTA is an acronym that
stands for autogenous antigen

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:84%
receptor-specific oncogenic
target acquisition.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad you
called it AARSOTA.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I'll try to remember that.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.860 align:middle line:90%
A-A-R-S-O-T-A.

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.460 align:middle line:90%
AARSOTA.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:90%
A-A-R-S-O-T-A. Exactly.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So autogenous means
your body's own.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Antigen receptor-specific
means it's

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:84%
specific to an
antigen receptor site

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that we're collecting,
that we isolate

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.117 align:middle line:84%
from the urine-- similar to
what Burzynski does, except he's

00:36:06.117 --> 00:36:08.200 align:middle line:84%
coming up with the
antineoplastons at a universal,

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:08.780 align:middle line:90%
across the board.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying that
the antigen receptor

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:84%
sites in everybody's tumor is
unique just as their DNA is

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.800 align:middle line:90%
unique, specific to them.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's an autogenous--
body's own--

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.840 align:middle line:84%
antigen receptor-specific--
specific to the DNA of that

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.967 align:middle line:90%
individual--

00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.060 align:middle line:84%
autonomour, antigen
receptor-specific, oncogenic--

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.900 align:middle line:90%
meaning cancer--

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.160 align:middle line:84%
target acquisition, meaning
it's acquiescing the target.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It helps the body's
immune system

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.880 align:middle line:84%
to identify what's
being foreign.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So cancer, first and
foremost, is a problem

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:90%
with the immune system.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.242 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have cancer if you
have an intact immune system.

00:36:39.242 --> 00:36:41.700 align:middle line:84%
If you have cancer, you don't
have an intact immune system.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.510 align:middle line:84%
People say, you know, my
immune system is fine.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.634 align:middle line:90%
Then you can't have cancer.

00:36:44.634 --> 00:36:46.440 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't two.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Those two things
can't live together.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.400 align:middle line:84%
If it's an immune system
that's compromised,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.192 align:middle line:90%
you could have cancer.

00:36:52.192 --> 00:36:54.150 align:middle line:84%
If you have cancer, you
have to, by definition,

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.770 align:middle line:84%
have a compromised
immune system.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So part of this is we have to
stimulate the immune system.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.439 align:middle line:84%
We have to repair
the immune system.

00:36:59.439 --> 00:37:01.102 align:middle line:84%
So there's five phases
that we use when

00:37:01.102 --> 00:37:02.310 align:middle line:90%
we deal with cancer patients.

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:03.910 align:middle line:84%
The first is systemic
detoxification,

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:90%
as we've talked about.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
physiological optimization.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So we want to optimize
the entire physiology

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.780 align:middle line:84%
to that of the highest
possible level that we can.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:18.120 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics lingo, this
would be achieving zero point.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to get maximum
benefit, maximum output,

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:84%
with the minimal
expenditure of energy.

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The third phase is
immune modulation.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.562 align:middle line:84%
We want to repair
the immune system,

00:37:27.562 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:84%
train the immune system
to start working again.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Fourth one is
target acquisition,

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.062 align:middle line:84%
or to acquiesce the
target, meaning--

00:37:34.062 --> 00:37:36.103 align:middle line:84%
again, you know, I'm prior
military-- so you have

00:37:36.103 --> 00:37:37.349 align:middle line:90%
to first identify the target.

00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is the
immune system, many times,

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:40.889 align:middle line:84%
doesn't identify
the cancer as being

00:37:40.889 --> 00:37:43.340 align:middle line:84%
formed because the
cancer mimics a fetus--

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.080 align:middle line:84%
alpha-phetoprotein,
human chorionic

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.170 align:middle line:84%
gonadotropin nonspecific
markers of cancer,

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.852 align:middle line:84%
but they're also
markers of pregnancy.

00:37:48.852 --> 00:37:51.060 align:middle line:84%
When you do a pregnancy
test, you're looking for hCG.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.518 align:middle line:10%
When you do have
alpha-phetoprotein

00:37:52.518 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:10%
for women for amniocentesis,
that's a marker of pregnancy,

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.524 align:middle line:10%
but it's also nonspecific
marker for cancer.

00:37:57.524 --> 00:38:00.190 align:middle line:10%
So the cancer mimics a fetus, so
the body doesn't respond to it.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:03.730 align:middle line:84%
So we have to now show the
body that this is not natural.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.562 align:middle line:84%
This thing that's
growing in here,

00:38:05.562 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:84%
it's not supposed
to be left alone,

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.070 align:middle line:84%
it's actually supposed
to be attacked.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to train the
body to acquiesce that target.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.282 align:middle line:84%
So we basically-- it's like
flipping on night goggles,

00:38:15.282 --> 00:38:16.740 align:middle line:84%
and all of sudden
you realize who's

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.150 align:middle line:84%
foreign and should
be-- you know,

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.010 align:middle line:84%
which are the aliens that
need to be eliminated,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and which are not, Ty, if you
believe in science fiction

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.130 align:middle line:90%
movies or anything like that.

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I think that aliens
are all friendly,

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:25.610 align:middle line:90%
if there are aliens out there.

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.570 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, you understand
what I'm saying.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:28.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a different part.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to know that
part of Dr. Buttar, right?

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I want to
know everything.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're going to go out
and see our UFO buddies next

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.011 align:middle line:90%
week, right, Ty?

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:34.843 align:middle line:90%
>> That sounds good.

00:38:34.843 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Sounds good.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the fourth part,
and then the fifth part is

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.210 align:middle line:90%
maintenance.

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the first one--
systemic detoxification,

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.072 align:middle line:84%
the second one the physiological
optimization, third one,

00:38:44.072 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:84%
immune modulation, fourth one,
target acquisition, and then

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.720 align:middle line:90%
the fifth step is maintenance.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
deal with cancer.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Buttar just mentioned
antineoplastons and Dr.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.242 align:middle line:90%
Burzynski.

00:38:54.242 --> 00:38:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So you know I had to
head down to Houston

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to talk to Dr. Burzynski
about this treatment,

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:84%
antineoplastons, which has
been very effective at treating

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:90%
brain cancer.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.220 align:middle line:10%
>> We proved that,
in certain areas,

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.840 align:middle line:10%
which is the most
difficult area of oncology,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.030 align:middle line:10%
which is the treatment of
incurable brain tumors,

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:16.250 align:middle line:10%
we can have very good responses
in various types of tumors.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:10%
And we can increase survival
of the patients remarkably.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, your wife showed
me pictures of brain tumors--

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.210 align:middle line:10%
It is scientifically
documented, and it's

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:30.355 align:middle line:10%
presented in research
articles, it's

00:39:30.355 --> 00:39:33.570 align:middle line:10%
presented at first-class
oncology congresses.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:10%
So there's no doubt,
if the patient

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.550 align:middle line:10%
was diagnosed at diagnosed
by some of the best

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:41.420 align:middle line:10%
scientists in the world with
an incurable brain tumor,

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.510 align:middle line:10%
and is surviving
to, say, 20 years,

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:10%
it means something works.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I saw a picture of a young
boy that was diagnosed at two,

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.033 align:middle line:90%
and now he's married with kids.

00:39:49.033 --> 00:39:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.010 align:middle line:10%
Plus, he is a fireman,
so this must work.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.218 align:middle line:10%
He must be in good condition.

00:39:52.218 --> 00:39:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> He must be.

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:90%
So you talk about brain tumors.

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Are there specific
types of cancer

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.580 align:middle line:84%
that the antineoplaston
treatment

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.470 align:middle line:90%
works better on than others?

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:04.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we concentrate on brain
tumors because brain tumors

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:08.400 align:middle line:10%
have the opinion of being
very difficult. So basically,

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.270 align:middle line:10%
you don't hear about spontaneous
regression of brain tumors.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's why we
selected brain tumors,

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.820 align:middle line:10%
because we knew if we proved
that we can have people who are

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.810 align:middle line:10%
surviving, say, for
a very long time--

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:10%
tumor-free over 10 years,
or 15 years, or 20 years--

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.450 align:middle line:10%
this means that it works.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:10%
Ultimately, you can probably
convince most of the critics

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:30.570 align:middle line:10%
that it works.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.580 align:middle line:10%
Because there is no
argument about survival.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.610 align:middle line:10%
You can have argument about
seeing the tumor shrinking.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:38.614 align:middle line:10%
Some of them will say,
OK, it shrunk 20%.

00:40:38.614 --> 00:40:39.780 align:middle line:10%
Some of them, it shrunk 50%.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:10%
Some of them, I don't
see this anymore.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.700 align:middle line:10%
But even the guys who always
will see something and say,

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:10%
no, it's not in remission.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.150 align:middle line:10%
But if the patient
who was supposed

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:10%
to be dead within two months
is surviving over 20 years,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.820 align:middle line:10%
this means that something works.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:10%
This year was quite special,
because within the last year,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.930 align:middle line:10%
we were invited to three
weddings of our patients

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:04.304 align:middle line:10%
who recovered completely
and got married.

00:41:04.304 --> 00:41:05.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I saw the pictures.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:08.150 align:middle line:10%
>> You mentioned one of them,
then we had some others.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.770 align:middle line:10%
And we had one patient
who recovered completely.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.320 align:middle line:10%
And she was a young
woman who was given up

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.080 align:middle line:10%
at the University of
California for brainstem

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.980 align:middle line:10%
glioma, DIPG, diffuse
intrinsic pontine glioma.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:10%
She failed completely.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:10%
She came to us.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.650 align:middle line:10%
We got rid of her tumor.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:24.780 align:middle line:10%
She got married.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.682 align:middle line:10%
She's got children.

00:41:25.682 --> 00:41:27.640 align:middle line:10%
Now, this year, she's
got her first grandchild.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:31.030 align:middle line:10%
And she is living a perfectly
normal life, 26 years later.

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.104 align:middle line:84%
Talk about epigenetics,
and the way

00:41:35.104 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking
at the genome.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.894 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
things that you

00:41:37.894 --> 00:41:41.270 align:middle line:84%
can do that would influence
the way that your genes express

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:42.070 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:42.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.070 align:middle line:10%
So epigenetics is
a science which

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:49.870 align:middle line:10%
studies the factors
which influence

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:10%
activity of the genes.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.480 align:middle line:10%
Basically, they turn on and
off activity of the genes.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.530 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we
studied extensively.

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.960 align:middle line:10%
And we found that
this is the mechanism

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.880 align:middle line:10%
of action of antineoplastons.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.430 align:middle line:10%
They don't really change
the structure of the genes,

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:09.010 align:middle line:10%
they work on the genes
from the outside.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.720 align:middle line:10%
They turn on and off the
activity of the genes.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.290 align:middle line:10%
And basically we are
trying to turn off

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.450 align:middle line:10%
the activity of the
genes which cause cancer,

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:20.450 align:middle line:10%
and turn on the activity of
genes which fight cancer.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.340 align:middle line:10%
And these are our
genes in our body.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:10%
So once this happens, then
the rest is done by the body.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.380 align:middle line:10%
So we don't really
kill malignant cells

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:10%
like chemotherapy.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.710 align:middle line:10%
We simply trigger the body
mechanism to do the job.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So the antineoplastons work
kind of like a light switch,

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:90%
turning on or off certain genes.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And the rest is done
by the body itself.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:10%
>> So that's why the treatment
can be done with relatively

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:47.780 align:middle line:10%
limited toxicity.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.450 align:middle line:10%
You can tell this because,
obviously, we are not really

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.840 align:middle line:10%
damaging the
structure of the body.

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:59.000 align:middle line:10%
We only influence the working
of the switches, more or less.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.590 align:middle line:10%
And so that's where
your treatment--

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.010 align:middle line:10%
>> But I am not permitted
to even say switches,

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.490 align:middle line:10%
because now I am sued by the
Texas Medical Board for saying

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:10%
that antineoplastons
work as switches.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Really?

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, because they say this
is a false advertisement,

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:10%
despite the fact that
this was introduced first,

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.790 align:middle line:10%
ingredients of antineoplastons,
by researchers from Johns

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:middle line:10%
Hopkins Medical School.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:23.100 align:middle line:10%
But I am now facing
a lawsuit while they

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.920 align:middle line:10%
make another announcement that I
am making false advertisements.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.810 align:middle line:10%
So what we do now will be
part of "false advertisement."

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> False advertisement.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:31.875 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right, yes.

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though it's
completely, 100% true.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes. well, the only thing
which I can say, publicly,

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.090 align:middle line:10%
is the address of the clinic.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:40.890 align:middle line:10%
>> That's it?

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:41.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, that's it.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:10%
Well that's the state of freedom
of speech in the state of Texas

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.700 align:middle line:10%
these days, according to the
Texas Medical Board, of course.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.100 align:middle line:10%
But this is a somewhat distorted
view of America, I believe.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.192 align:middle line:90%
>> It seems like the Dark Ages.

00:43:54.192 --> 00:43:54.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:54.991 --> 00:43:55.937 align:middle line:90%
There are dark ages.

00:43:55.937 --> 00:43:58.520 align:middle line:10%
In medicine, we are beginning
to have dark ages, unless people

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.436 align:middle line:10%
will take some action.

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk about the way that the
antineoplastons act as sort

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.760 align:middle line:84%
of like an epigenetic
trigger, and the way that,

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.550 align:middle line:84%
what would cause certain
cancer cells to map incorrectly

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:11.830 align:middle line:90%
and become cancerous.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:15.670 align:middle line:84%
What are cancer cells, and what
causes these genetic switches

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:18.885 align:middle line:84%
to map incorrectly that you
would be diagnosed with cancer?

00:44:18.885 --> 00:44:22.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, cancer cells
have their own genome,

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.540 align:middle line:10%
which is abnormal genome.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:30.820 align:middle line:10%
And this genome is really
directed to rapidly multiply

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.540 align:middle line:10%
cells to create a
lot of new cells

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.510 align:middle line:10%
which do not play a normal
function of the body.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:10%
They are pretty much
useless for the body.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.640 align:middle line:10%
And because of
this, they spread,

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.000 align:middle line:10%
they take away nutrients
from normal cells,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.070 align:middle line:10%
they exhaust the body.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:51.040 align:middle line:10%
Finally, they invade vital
organs and they kill the body.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.860 align:middle line:10%
So basically, these
are the cells which

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.180 align:middle line:10%
will have their own genome--

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.800 align:middle line:10%
this cancerous genome.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.110 align:middle line:10%
And it's not a single gene
which can cause such problems.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.450 align:middle line:10%
Initially it can start
with some abnormality

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:04.950 align:middle line:10%
in a single gene, which
could be inherited,

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.060 align:middle line:10%
which can be caused by
exposure to radiation,

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.520 align:middle line:10%
by a virus infection,
by lack of sleep,

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.460 align:middle line:10%
by exposure to
electromagnetic waves,

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:14.740 align:middle line:10%
by thousands of
different factors.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:10%
And most of these
changes will come and go.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:21.970 align:middle line:10%
And the body is able to protect
itself, and eliminate it.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:26.950 align:middle line:10%
So then cancer is not
so easy to really start,

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.010 align:middle line:10%
because the body has a very
good preventative system.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:33.850 align:middle line:10%
We believe that antineoplastons
play a very good line

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:37.590 align:middle line:10%
of defense, and they immediately
switch off these abnormal genes

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.100 align:middle line:10%
and they get rid of cancer.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.130 align:middle line:10%
So they all die out, and
there are no new cells

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:43.332 align:middle line:10%
which contain this problem.

00:45:43.332 --> 00:45:45.040 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have
enough antineoplastons,

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:50.170 align:middle line:10%
then, obviously, these
changes will get established.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And then there will
be some more changes.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.230 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just simple
changes that cause the problem,

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.380 align:middle line:10%
it's a number of different
changes in various genes

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.770 align:middle line:10%
to build a network
which really causes

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.430 align:middle line:10%
malignant transformation.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.160 align:middle line:10%
And then once it gets going,
it's getting worse and worse,

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.460 align:middle line:10%
it's changing all the
time, and it's becoming

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.780 align:middle line:10%
more and more malignant.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:13.392 align:middle line:10%
And, finally, the body
is unable to control it.

00:46:13.392 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:10%
So that's pretty
much what happens.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:19.510 align:middle line:10%
But there is a multitude of
factors at the beginning.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:23.820 align:middle line:10%
And later, once
it comes to start,

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.500 align:middle line:10%
then obviously it's very
difficult to get rid of this.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.250 align:middle line:10%
So you need to boost
your own defense.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.710 align:middle line:10%
The immune system,
in most cases,

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.260 align:middle line:10%
is not able to recognize
these cells because they're

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.020 align:middle line:10%
very similar to normal cells.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.170 align:middle line:10%
If you don't have enough
antineoplastons in your body,

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:43.490 align:middle line:10%
then you are not able
to redirect these cells,

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.320 align:middle line:10%
and then the cancer
begins developing.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So the antineoplastons,
as opposed to the traditional

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.000 align:middle line:90%
treatments for cancer--

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.990 align:middle line:90%
the chemo and radiation--

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:84%
the antineoplastons
don't harm the body.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.967 align:middle line:84%
The chemo works by
destroying indiscriminately.

00:46:58.967 --> 00:47:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And the radiation
destroys indiscriminately.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But the antineoplastons
really switch on your genes

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
in your body that would
selectively target the cancer.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.980 align:middle line:10%
The idea is to simply mount
the body's mechanism, which

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.510 align:middle line:10%
would get rid of cancer.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.025 align:middle line:10%
>> Because normally the
body is equipped to do it.

00:47:16.025 --> 00:47:18.710 align:middle line:10%
But there is something in
the body which went wrong,

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:21.300 align:middle line:10%
and turned off the mechanism
which is protection

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.100 align:middle line:10%
against cancer.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:25.160 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, everybody will get
cancer early and die from it.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Dr. Burzynski,
the antineoplastons act

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.130 align:middle line:84%
as selectively toxic switches,
targeting only the cancer

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:33.160 align:middle line:90%
cells, but not the normal cells.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.750 align:middle line:84%
In these next few
clips, we're going

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.280 align:middle line:84%
to learn about using
herbs and herbal tonics

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.987 align:middle line:90%
to successfully treat cancer.

00:47:38.987 --> 00:47:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen good
results with Essiac tea.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:40.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.003 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some really
excellent results with that.

00:47:43.003 --> 00:47:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>> My grandmother, who died of
cancer in '98, was diagnosed

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.340 align:middle line:84%
in her late 80s, and she
was supposedly terminal,

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.940 align:middle line:84%
she used Essiac
tea for 10 years.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.940 align:middle line:90%
And it gave her another decade.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:48:00.380 align:middle line:10%
I had a patient who had
a bowel obstruction,

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.770 align:middle line:10%
and I opened him up, and he
had a cancer of his cecum,

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.580 align:middle line:10%
where the appendix was.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And the cut it out, but it had
already spread to his liver,

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:11.252 align:middle line:84%
and so he was kind of doomed
by conventional things.

00:48:11.252 --> 00:48:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
taking chemotherapy,

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:16.010 align:middle line:90%
he took Essiac tea.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And he went for
years under my care,

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and the tumor never came back.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:21.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:48:21.514 --> 00:48:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen good
results with Essiac.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Anything else that you're
using currently when you're

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.500 align:middle line:90%
treating cancer patients?

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot
of possibilities.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes mega doses of
things like vitamin A--

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Ramsberger in Germany used
vitamin A in giant doses.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin A is considered toxic
above 25,000 units a day.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:44.840 align:middle line:84%
He, just for experimental sake,
went up to half a million units

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.167 align:middle line:84%
a day of vitamin A. His
skin kind of fell off.

00:48:48.167 --> 00:48:50.125 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as he stopped
taking the vitamin A,

00:48:50.125 --> 00:48:53.150 align:middle line:90%
he got all better.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:56.270 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes megadoses of
things like A, vitamin C

00:48:56.270 --> 00:49:00.770 align:middle line:84%
megadoses, vitamin D now has
been shown to have value--

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Lots of vitamin D out today.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Vitamin D.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.034 align:middle line:10%
>> The most famous
one is called Iscador.

00:49:06.034 --> 00:49:07.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you've heard
of that on your travels.

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's going to
have talked about it.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Suzanne Somers made it famous,
and perhaps she took it.

00:49:13.370 --> 00:49:18.075 align:middle line:84%
It's basically
Viscum-- a mistletoe.

00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Viscum album, it's called.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.272 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the action, though,
in the mistletoe to treat

00:49:22.272 --> 00:49:23.072 align:middle line:90%
cancer?

00:49:23.072 --> 00:49:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, mistletoe
is highly toxic.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Now listen, this is
going on another thing.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want too much
in alternative or holistic

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.710 align:middle line:84%
treatments if
they're toxic stuff--

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:34.460 align:middle line:84%
that's what I call
chemotherapy thinking.

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.626 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'll take stuff
that will kill the cancer,

00:49:36.626 --> 00:49:38.489 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even have
to change my diet.

00:49:38.489 --> 00:49:39.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to work.

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You've got to do all the good
things I've been talking about.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But mistletoe--
you can't say it's

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.737 align:middle line:90%
safe, and natural, and holistic.

00:49:45.737 --> 00:49:47.070 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely poisonous, right?

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:48.653 align:middle line:84%
But if you take it
in the right dose--

00:49:48.653 --> 00:49:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's got a tradition
of hundreds of years now--

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Iscador itself was
developed by Rudolf Steiner,

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.295 align:middle line:84%
back in Victorian times,
and it contained--

00:49:56.295 --> 00:49:57.170 align:middle line:90%
there's a few things.

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a mixture.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.970 align:middle line:84%
One of the important
ones is mercury iodide,

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:03.256 align:middle line:84%
and the iodine is
great for thyroid.

00:50:03.256 --> 00:50:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Of course that's
something else I

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.420 align:middle line:84%
haven't got time
to elaborate on.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.929 align:middle line:84%
But 20 years ago, I noticed
that it had surfaced

00:50:08.929 --> 00:50:09.970 align:middle line:90%
in all of the literature.

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.210 align:middle line:90%
I keep seeing it.

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:14.240 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed it because
they used those EAV testing

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.640 align:middle line:84%
machines, and it would
tell you hidden signals.

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And time and again with cancer,
you get a signal for thyroid--

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.330 align:middle line:90%
the thyroid wasn't performing.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:23.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, an
underperforming thyroid

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:24.890 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
biggest reasons why

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:26.690 align:middle line:90%
the immune system goes down.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:29.501 align:middle line:84%
You cannot afford to
have insufficient--

00:50:29.501 --> 00:50:30.500 align:middle line:90%
that's a tongue-twister.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.516 align:middle line:84%
You cannot afford to have
an inefficient thyroid

00:50:34.516 --> 00:50:35.390 align:middle line:90%
if you've got cancer.

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:37.019 align:middle line:84%
So you need to
beef it up, and you

00:50:37.019 --> 00:50:38.810 align:middle line:84%
need to have your
thyroid checked, in fact.

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So it has another
part to it, yes.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.750 align:middle line:84%
All that's built in
to the Iscador remedy.

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you take it as it
should be, it's very safe.

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to tell you
that something like 60%--

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.990 align:middle line:84%
it's the most prescribed
oncological treatment

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.900 align:middle line:90%
in Germany.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:57.013 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't believe that.

00:50:57.013 --> 00:50:59.210 align:middle line:84%
But 60% of cancer
patients will take it,

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:00.930 align:middle line:84%
whether the doctor
says to or not.

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:01.730 align:middle line:90%
They will.

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:03.104 align:middle line:84%
It's got a very
strong tradition.

00:51:03.104 --> 00:51:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, over
here, you know,

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.240 align:middle line:84%
if you don't think German
means it could be good,

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.230 align:middle line:84%
then Suzanne Somers
is your reference.

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:12.044 align:middle line:84%
She liked it, and she claims
it really, really helped her.

00:51:12.044 --> 00:51:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And I've used it
a lot, of course.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was looking around at
that time for what could I do.

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And I read some books
about Rudolf Steiner.

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:23.150 align:middle line:10%
And back in the 1920s, he
was doing something called

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.240 align:middle line:10%
anthroproscopic medicine.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:30.460 align:middle line:10%
And one of the medicines that
jumped out at me was Iscador.

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:35.050 align:middle line:84%
It was said that it builds
up your immune system

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.174 align:middle line:84%
to be so strong that nothing
can invade or attack.

00:51:38.174 --> 00:51:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of made
sense, because clearly I

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:43.340 align:middle line:84%
had cancer because there was
some flaw in my immune system.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.160 align:middle line:90%
So I injected Iscador for--

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I started to do
it for two years.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I got it from Weleda
in Switzerland.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.136 align:middle line:84%
It's legal to bring it
into this country today,

00:51:54.136 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:84%
but, at that time,
at least, they

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.070 align:middle line:90%
weren't selling it in America.

00:51:57.070 --> 00:51:58.420 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they are now.

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.580 align:middle line:90%
And then I kept on taking it.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:05.151 align:middle line:84%
I took it up until
the time that--

00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:06.400 align:middle line:90%
and I'm sure we'll get there--

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I ended up in the
hospital again,

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:10.560 align:middle line:84%
being diagnosed with cancer,
which was a misdiagnosis.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Now let me ask you also about
another combination of herbs

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.670 align:middle line:90%
that's called the Hoxsey Tonic.

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:18.944 align:middle line:84%
It was a tea that was formulated
by a man named Harry Hoxsey.

00:52:18.944 --> 00:52:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Actually it was formulated
by his grandfather,

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.930 align:middle line:90%
and it was passed down to Harry.

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And it contains red clover.

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to speak with you
specifically about red clover

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.480 align:middle line:84%
because one of the later
combinations of the Essiac tea

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.470 align:middle line:90%
contained the clover.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And the Hoxsey tea also did.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Talk about red clover
in treating cancer.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Red clover is
a blood purifier.

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.980 align:middle line:10%
So, basically, your
blood system is

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:43.420 align:middle line:10%
going to be the cancer highway.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.570 align:middle line:10%
It's going to help
spread the cancer cells.

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So red clover is a nice way to
sweep those cancer cells out

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:50.290 align:middle line:90%
of the blood system.

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:53.920 align:middle line:84%
If you layer it with bloodroot,
and burdock, and yellow dock,

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.750 align:middle line:84%
you get even more
power in doing that.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a blood
cleanser, if you will.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And blood, when it's laden
down with impurities,

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:84%
can't carry enough oxygen
and nutrition to the cells

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.790 align:middle line:84%
to help them power up and
defend themselves and get rid

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:07.690 align:middle line:90%
of cancer.

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So red clover is
an excellent herb.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
it in their yards,

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.540 align:middle line:84%
but they usually spray it
with Roundup or something.

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you have some, don't
spray it with Roundup.

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you do decide
to collect it,

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.920 align:middle line:84%
it's usually going
to be at the fall,

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.400 align:middle line:84%
in September, when the
buds turn bright red.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.160 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:28.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.293 align:middle line:84%
Some really powerful information
that we learned tonight

00:53:31.293 --> 00:53:33.070 align:middle line:84%
about the diagnostics
for cancer,

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the dangers of the
diagnostics, how they actually

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:39.160 align:middle line:84%
might increase cancer risks,
and how they tend to give false

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.150 align:middle line:90%
positives.

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we got into so many
different natural treatments.

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And then tomorrow night,
I'm doing the same thing.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.160 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.494 align:middle line:84%
Because there are so many
natural treatments for cancer.

00:53:47.494 --> 00:53:48.868 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
you might not know

00:53:48.868 --> 00:53:51.130 align:middle line:84%
is that I've personally had
skin cancer several times.

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I developed a spot on my
face, didn't know what it was,

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out it was
basal cell carcinoma.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.390 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I was
faced with a decision--

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:00.320 align:middle line:90%
what do I do about it?

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Do I go under the knife, which
is your typical treatment

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:03.970 align:middle line:90%
for skin cancer?

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Or do I stick to
my guns and do what

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.710 align:middle line:90%
I've learned over the years?

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:11.710 align:middle line:84%
What I did, I took this natural
salve, and I put it on the spot

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:13.665 align:middle line:84%
on my face that was the
basal cell carcinoma.

00:54:13.665 --> 00:54:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, when
I first put it

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.080 align:middle line:84%
on I wasn't really quite
sure what to expect,

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.120 align:middle line:84%
but within about
five or six days,

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.670 align:middle line:84%
the spot actually
fell out and the skin

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:25.420 align:middle line:84%
healed over it, and no
more cancer at that spot.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:27.100 align:middle line:84%
These treatments
really work, folks.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.852 align:middle line:84%
I know from a
personal perspective.

00:54:28.852 --> 00:54:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And I also know because I've
been literally contacted

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.580 align:middle line:84%
by thousands of people
over the years that

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:36.190 align:middle line:84%
have shared with me their
personal stories of cancer

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.125 align:middle line:90%
victory using these treatments.

00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I know you learned a
lot from tonight's show,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to learn a
lot from tomorrow night's show.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.456 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to
seeing you then.

00:54:43.456 --> 00:54:46.748 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:54:46.748 --> 00:55:00.050 align:middle line:90%


00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:00.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:02.474 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here tonight
with Dr. Lee Cowden

00:55:02.474 --> 00:55:04.680 align:middle line:84%
We're outside Washington
DC at the Sacred--

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.820 align:middle line:90%
what's it called?

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.690 align:middle line:10%
Sacred Fire of Liberty Gala.

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:08.490 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:11.200 align:middle line:10%
>> And so I've been able to
talk to Dr. Cowden this weekend.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.180 align:middle line:10%
And he was sharing
something with me

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.770 align:middle line:10%
earlier I just wanted to get
all of our listeners and viewers

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:15.770 align:middle line:10%
to learn about.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.150 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Cowden, if you
could share with me,

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.190 align:middle line:84%
what techniques are
you currently using

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.090 align:middle line:84%
to treat cancer, and
you're teaching doctors

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:22.890 align:middle line:90%
to treat cancer?

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a practice
until 2009, and then

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.401 align:middle line:84%
after that I started teaching
others practitioners what

00:55:27.401 --> 00:55:29.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd learned over the
previous 30 years.

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But this technique that I find
extremely helpful in dealing

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.580 align:middle line:84%
with cancer patients, especially
the advanced cancer patients,

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:39.070 align:middle line:90%
is called Recall Healing.

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So practitioners
can learn about that

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:43.730 align:middle line:84%
by going to our
Academy website--

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:47.390 align:middle line:90%
www.acimconnect.com.

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And there on the website, we
have four 13-hour courses.

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So 52 hours worth of education
about Recall Healing.

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But the principle
of Recall Healing

00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:01.362 align:middle line:84%
is that you identify
the diagnosis,

00:56:01.362 --> 00:56:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and based on the
diagnosis, you can

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.736 align:middle line:84%
tell what the emotional
conflict is that would

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:06.390 align:middle line:90%
have brought on the diagnosis.

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, once you know
the emotional conflict,

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and the time of the
onset of the illness,

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.120 align:middle line:84%
then you can actually
go back and identify

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:15.150 align:middle line:84%
what the events were that
probably triggered the cancer.

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not a
complicated process,

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:22.270 align:middle line:84%
but you have to have the
patient have an aha moment.

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:24.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can't tell them
what the conflict is,

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.490 align:middle line:84%
you have to ask
leading questions that

00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:29.650 align:middle line:84%
finally makes them realize
what the conflict is.

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:30.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's the key.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And so the way that
I teach practitioners

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:38.440 align:middle line:84%
do this is to learn the
use of the eVox device--

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:42.440 align:middle line:90%
eVox is zyto.com technology.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.931 align:middle line:84%
With the eVox, the patient
speaks into a microphone.

00:56:44.931 --> 00:56:46.680 align:middle line:84%
The microphone is not
recording the words,

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.138 align:middle line:84%
but it is recording
the frequencies

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:49.620 align:middle line:90%
that are embedded in the voice.

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:53.687 align:middle line:84%
And after 15 seconds of speaking
about a person or an event,

00:56:53.687 --> 00:56:56.020 align:middle line:84%
displayed on the computer
screen are all of the emotions

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and beliefs that you have
about that person or about

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:01.770 align:middle line:90%
that belief--

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:03.480 align:middle line:90%
about that person or that event.

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:06.690 align:middle line:84%
So, what happens then, is
that for the person seeing

00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:09.590 align:middle line:84%
that on the computer screen, it
becomes an aha moment for them

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:10.390 align:middle line:90%
at that moment.

00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So they see emotional
issues that they weren't

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.180 align:middle line:90%
aware of 15 seconds earlier.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And so then that gives
the brain that opportunity

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:19.240 align:middle line:90%
to start a healing process.

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.470 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, the
device converts their own voice

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:25.860 align:middle line:84%
frequencies into homeopathic
homochords-- basically a higher

00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:27.542 align:middle line:84%
level of energy that
it delivers back

00:57:27.542 --> 00:57:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to the patient
through an electrode

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.999 align:middle line:84%
that the patient has their
hand on while they're

00:57:30.999 --> 00:57:33.540 align:middle line:84%
listening to pleasant music
and watching flashing lights

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.080 align:middle line:90%
through their closed eyelids.

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So when we create a marriage
between the eVox therapy

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and Recall Healing, you get an
extremely powerful combination.

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes will
encourage practitioners

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:47.430 align:middle line:90%
to add one other tool to that.

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:50.490 align:middle line:84%
It's called Ezov-- not
to be confused with eVox.

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:55.495 align:middle line:84%
But Ezov are drops
of extract of hyssop

00:57:55.495 --> 00:57:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that's been quantum
physically embedded

00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.180 align:middle line:84%
with 45 combinations of
energies that make it act

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.700 align:middle line:90%
like a very complex homeopathy.

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when you take the
Ezov drop at bedtime,

00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and you don't do anything
else, you actually

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:09.840 align:middle line:90%
change your dream state.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So if you've had a repetitive
dream that never gets resolved,

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.220 align:middle line:84%
you have a dream that finally
resolves that conflict.

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.620 align:middle line:84%
If you've always dreamed
in black and white,

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:20.940 align:middle line:90%
you start dreaming in color.

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.440 align:middle line:84%
If you've never remembered
your dreams before,

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.970 align:middle line:84%
you start remembering
your dreams.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But you start your
Ezov drops some days

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.040 align:middle line:84%
in advance of the eVox and
Recall Healing session.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Then the patient comes for
the eVox and Recall Healing

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:32.560 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And you take the history, figure
out what the conflict would be,

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and start doing some, I call
it, roundabout questions

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to the patient so that they
can try to get at some of that.

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.640 align:middle line:84%
When you finally hit
the mark, if they

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:47.100 align:middle line:84%
don't get a full
breakthrough in the resolving

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.950 align:middle line:84%
of that emotional conflict,
then you do the eVox session.

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And then they can finish the
resolution of that conflict.

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's really about--

00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:56.430 align:middle line:84%
one of the main
keys is resolving

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:57.690 align:middle line:90%
the emotional conflicts.

00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:00.870 align:middle line:84%
What I've learned over
the last 30-some-odd years

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:06.320 align:middle line:84%
is that the body develops
a symptom because, usually,

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.650 align:middle line:90%
of an inflammatory process.

00:59:07.650 --> 00:59:10.560 align:middle line:84%
The inflammation usually comes
from microbes in the body,

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and the immune system
responds to the microbes,

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.820 align:middle line:84%
or toxins in the body,
and the immune system

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.050 align:middle line:90%
responds to those toxins.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:17.940 align:middle line:10%
There's sometimes both
toxins and microbes

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.320 align:middle line:10%
in an immune system response.

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.690 align:middle line:10%
But anyway, the
toxins will hang up

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:23.790 align:middle line:10%
in the body, in my
experience, where there's

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:27.000 align:middle line:10%
an unresolved conscious
or subconscious-- usually

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.810 align:middle line:10%
a subconscious emotion for
the deepest physical diseases

00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:31.890 align:middle line:10%
that we have.

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And the emotions that
have the greatest

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.810 align:middle line:84%
impact on the physical
health are the emotions

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:39.150 align:middle line:90%
that we experience in the womb.

00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So, before we're
even born, we're

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:43.420 align:middle line:84%
picking up mom's emotion
and dad's emotion

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and carrying those
forward into our life.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
most impactful,

00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.590 align:middle line:84%
on our physical health,
are the emotions

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:51.660 align:middle line:84%
that we experience in
the first year of life.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:54.407 align:middle line:84%
And the third most
impactful are the emotions

00:59:54.407 --> 00:59:56.740 align:middle line:84%
that are experienced in the
second year life, and so on.

00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So by the time you're
about a teenager,

00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.810 align:middle line:84%
then usually you
don't have much impact

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.160 align:middle line:84%
on the physical
health from emotions

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that you've
experienced, unless it's

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.330 align:middle line:84%
scraping the scab off
an emotional wound that

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:09.890 align:middle line:84%
was in your being from in
the womb or early childhood.

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And so you said this is
really focused on emotions.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.190 align:middle line:90%
And you're coupling it with--

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:16.940 align:middle line:84%
does this have anything to do
with the German new medicine

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:17.510 align:middle line:90%
that you were mentioning?

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So the Recall Healing
that I mentioned

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:22.940 align:middle line:84%
is a synthesis of
German new medicine--

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ryke Hamer in
Germany started

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:27.800 align:middle line:90%
developing that in 1978.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And then he became
very skilled in it

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.044 align:middle line:84%
because he resolved his own
testicular cancer first,

01:00:33.044 --> 01:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
then he resolved
testicular cancer

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
in a bunch of other men the same
way, just by asking questions

01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and when they had the
emotional conflict resolution,

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.610 align:middle line:90%
the cancer just went away.

01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Then he resolved
ovarian cancer in women,

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
then he started working
on lung cancer, and lots

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:46.380 align:middle line:90%
of other cancers.

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Hamer presented
his research findings

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to the University of
Tubingen, and by law they

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
were required to
replicate his research

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that he did to see whether
it was true or not.

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
But to this day, they have
still not replicate it,

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:07.070 align:middle line:84%
because they knew that probably
it would be replicable,

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want to show
that just asking questions was

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
comparable to giving
chemotherapy, or surgery,

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:14.570 align:middle line:90%
or radiation.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So Dr. Hamer was very upset
that they would not replicate

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
his research as required by
law, so he started speaking out

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:25.090 align:middle line:90%
to the media and to the public.

01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, he was arrested

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
for inciting the public against
the medical establishment,

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and tried.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
And during the court trial,
something that has almost

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
never happened in history, is
that the attorney representing

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Hamer got the prosecuting
attorney up on the stand

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:46.600 align:middle line:84%
to take an oath and
testify on Hamer's behalf.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happened was, the
prosecuting attorney has gotten

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
the records from Hamer's office
and had his staff call 6,000

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
people to find out what was
going on with the families

01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:00.590 align:middle line:90%
or the patients.

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
He found that 92% of the
patients that were called

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.200 align:middle line:90%
were still alive.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
92% were still alive
five years after Hamer

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
did his one-time emotional
conflict resolution.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.150 align:middle line:84%
This is patients with stage
III and stage IV cancer.

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> 92%?

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.604 align:middle line:90%
>> 92% were still alive.

01:02:22.604 --> 01:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> A little bit better
than the conventional--

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Just a little
bit better, yes.

01:02:25.895 --> 01:02:28.280 align:middle line:90%


01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
My name is Terry,
and let me tell you

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.280 align:middle line:84%
about my story, my recovery
from stage IV breast cancer.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, in 2002 I was diagnosed
with breast cancer,

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and I went through
the medical route.

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I had surgery,
chemotherapy, radiation.

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:54.490 align:middle line:90%
I ended up with a mastectomy.

01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Every year, once a year,
the cancer would come back.

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, after
the doctors started

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
to give me chemotherapy,
which was a pill--

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
which was so toxic my
husband wasn't allowed

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.210 align:middle line:84%
to touch it with his
hands, but I'm supposed

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.240 align:middle line:90%
to swallow it twice a day--

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and after that--
and the doctor said,

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
well, this will give
you a few more months.

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And then at that point
it was stage IV cancer.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I went through it.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I had these side effects,
which burned my hands

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and the bottoms
of my feet, and it

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.960 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was walking on
rocks with sunburned feet.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
At that point in time,
I just prayed to God.

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, all right, I'm
ready to go home if that's

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:49.100 align:middle line:90%
what you want me to do.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm really OK with it.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you want more for
me to do, just show me.

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I've done everything
I thought I should do,

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.550 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't working.

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So after I prayed, and
as I was recovering

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.770 align:middle line:84%
from all of the
chemotherapy, I had

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:12.250 align:middle line:84%
read a lot about natural
healing for cancer.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And through reading that,
several different people

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:27.550 align:middle line:84%
contacted me through a route
which encompassed the five

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:29.470 align:middle line:90%
essentials of maximized living.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And this was before I even
knew anything about it.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But I ended up going through
a detox, which was a detox

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
program through raw
foods and colonics,

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of things
to detox my body.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I took Essiac tea.

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:50.590 align:middle line:90%
But all kinds of natural routes.

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, after about three
months, the cancer was gone,

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:56.770 align:middle line:90%
and it never did come back.

01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:59.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's been 10 years.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:04.930 align:middle line:90%
So through that, God healed me.

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:08.280 align:middle line:90%
