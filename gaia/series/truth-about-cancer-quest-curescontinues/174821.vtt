00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back, everyone,
to The Quest for the Cures

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:90%
Continues.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.835 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you
joined us tonight.

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you remember
last night--

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.793 align:middle line:84%
I hope you tuned in-- we learn
about how to detoxify your body

00:00:31.793 --> 00:00:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and how to get rid of
all the bad guys that

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:84%
may be compromising your
health and making you sick.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, I'm really honored to
be able to talk to Dr. Patrick

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Quillin again.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:84%
If you remember, he led
off last night's episode,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to lead off
tonight's episode as well.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I was able to sit down with him
at his house out in California.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.240 align:middle line:84%
We talked about what he
calls nature's pharmacy.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, he
pulled me out to the backyard.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.477 align:middle line:90%
He said, welcome to my pharmacy.

00:00:56.477 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able
to sit down with him

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and learn from one of the
best, if not the best,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.309 align:middle line:90%
expert on nutrition.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact
Dr. Quillin wrote

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
a book called, "Beating
Cancer with Nutrition."

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.016 align:middle line:84%
That's been a bestseller
for the last 20 years.

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't
surprise us, though,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.550 align:middle line:90%
about nature being a pharmacy.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Look, maybe 150 years
ago, 200 years ago,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
was the first
pharmaceutical drugs.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
Before that, all
we had was nature.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.185 align:middle line:84%
All we had was
nature's pharmacy.

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of that knowledge
about nature's pharmacy

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.889 align:middle line:90%
has been lost over the years.

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going to empower you
with that knowledge tonight.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.630 align:middle line:90%
You are going to learn a lot.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.950 align:middle line:90%
So please sit down.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:90%
Grab a cup of water.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the show.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.449 align:middle line:90%

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Mother nature has
the answer for cancer.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
There's now 300 studies
showing that diet

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
rich in fruits and vegetables
can lower the risk for cancer.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:84%
For instance, this is
a surinam cherry tree.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
You can see it's going to
be very prolific, abundant.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Mangoes, apples.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
Have a look at this thing.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:90%
This is a ripe mulberry.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I find that in dark red and
green fruits and vegetables,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
there's a compound
called phytoalexins.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
In nature, this thing
is out in nature

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and fungus wants to
sit on this sweet fruit

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:90%
and begin to decompose it.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the plant protects itself
by making this phytoalexin.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a chemical that
is a pro-drug that's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:90%
antifungal in the beginning.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:90%
If the fungus eats it, it dies.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
If we eat the fruit and
that phytoalexin goes in us,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:90%
then the cancer dies.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.140 align:middle line:84%
This has the same
anti-cancer properties

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.990 align:middle line:90%
as antifungal in the fruit.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.599 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the
Black Mission Fig.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Black Mission-- that's
the one you usually see

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
in the stores, at
least in Texas.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:90%
They're the Black Missions.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what you're going
to get in Fig Newtons.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So these will
turn dark and soft.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And see some of those that are
in the process of ripening.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And figs have a
compound that they've

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.341 align:middle line:84%
identified called
ficin, which has

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:90%
powerful anti-cancer activity.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>> National Cancer Institute
would love to be able to patent

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
a drug like ficin, but they
can't figure it out yet.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Leafy greens.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, these are great.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Spinach, beet greens.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:90%
I got beets growing there.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
There's beets the size of a
watermelon underneath that,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
but I just keep
eating the greens.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No kidding?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.930 align:middle line:90%
The size of a watermelon.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.250 align:middle line:90%
A big beet in there.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
greens are rich in--

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:84%
they figure there's somewhere
around 8,000 bioflavonoids

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:84%
and 20,000 carotenoids that
are in Mother Nature's fruits

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:84%
This bears a fruit about
the size of a golf ball

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
that looks like chocolate and
tastes like a sweet potato.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Black sapote-- it
doesn't get any better.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Basically a sound bite
is, go for the color.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
In the color are those
pigments, phytochemicals,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
that have powerful
anti-cancer activity.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to my pharmacy.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:84%
The planet Earth is
one of the greatest

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
pharmacy's ever invented, and
we're ignoring most of it.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
And we go down to the drugstore
and spend $280 billion a year

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:84%
on prescription drugs
in this country.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.450 align:middle line:10%
And according to an article
in the Journal of the American

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:10%
Medical Association, there's
140,000 Americans each year

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:10%
who die from the on label
use of prescription drugs.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
That means following doctor's
prescriptions, 140,000.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.700 align:middle line:84%
That means it's somewhere
around the third leading cause

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
of death in America-- using
drugs that may be useful,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes are toxic.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:90%
Try nutrition first.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.497 align:middle line:84%
In many cases it can
solve the problem.

00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Dr. Quillin.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:90%
And you mentioned clean foods.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take a break here--

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to eat a little
bit of a clean food.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
This is a mulberry that you
just gave me from your yard.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Rich in phytoalexins,
anti-cancer to the maximum.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That is good.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.523 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a mulberry
that's that shape.

00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:04.699 align:middle line:90%
Why is it so long?

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> There are several different
types of mulberry trees.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
That is a Pakistan
mulberry that you just had.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have an Oscar
mulberry, too.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I was trying to select
fruit trees-- first of all,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I live in California.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a desert.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:90%
We have a water shortage.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a particular
water shortage

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:90%
this year with the drought.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Why would you water something
if you can't eat it?

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm watering just
the fruit trees.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And among those are fruit trees
that are high in nutrients.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And one of the sound bites I
mentioned is go for the color.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
In the color, in those
pigments-- the reds, orange,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:90%
yellows, dark colors.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And that mulberry is
a dark purple color.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
What you have is
Mother Nature has

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.420 align:middle line:84%
sunshine coming down and
hitting the chlorophyll

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:90%
and the chloroplast.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's through
photosynthesis making sugar.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:90%
And from that comes all of life.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning
of all life on Earth.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:84%
How does the plant
protect itself

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
from the damaging
effects of sun?

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Because you've
got both sunlight,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
that is mutagenic, carcinogenic.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's all kinds of--
it's a damaging x-ray.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:90%
How does a plant protect itself?

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
About 20,000 different
bioflavonoids

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and about 800
different carotenoids

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.670 align:middle line:84%
are in colorful
fruits and vegetables.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And they protect the
plant from the sun,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and from the effects
of photosynthesis.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Given that, what
we're talking about is

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I was choosing
fruits and vegetables

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.240 align:middle line:84%
that would be not only tasty,
and not readily available

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:84%
in the stores--
for instance figs.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.732 align:middle line:90%
Figs don't travel well.

00:06:33.732 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why most people don't
find them in the stores,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and most people,
including myself,

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
the only things I had had while
living in the Midwest was Fig

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Newton's.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But in fact in figs, is
not just a delicious taste,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.630 align:middle line:84%
but there is a phytochemical--
phyto means plant,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.700 align:middle line:90%
chemical is the substance in it.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
In figs, a substance
called ficin--

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:84%
F-I-C-I-N-- which the National
Cancer Institute has been

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
researching, hoping to find a
synthetic analog so they can

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:90%
make a patented drug.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you have access
to that through figs.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a powerful
anti-cancer bioregulators.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
This is where it
really hits me, Ty,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:90%
as to how powerful nature is.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm hoping that I
can infect the viewers

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
with a sense of
respect for what God

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
has given us, and the
good Mother Earth,

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:90%
and in our food supply.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:90%
And here's a simple soundbite--

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
this human body,
60 trillion cells

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:84%
orchestrated like no
other organism on Earth.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:84%
There's no robot or
any machine that we

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:84%
will build that will
ever come close to what

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:90%
the human being does.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Then we have our food supply.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:84%
No food ever has just
one nutrient in it.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And they keep doing
mono-nutrient studies--

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:90%
studying one nutrient.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:90%
That's not the way nature works.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
We tamper with our food
supply by slice, dice,

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:90%
chop, and blend.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And add hydrogenated fats
and and color flavorings--

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:84%
2,800 different
FDA Food additives,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:84%
most of which have
not really been tested

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:90%
for their carcinogenicity.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we tamper
with the food supply.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.490 align:middle line:90%
We tamper with our body.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
A child, by 30 months, has had
30 vaccinations, some of them

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:90%
with mercury in them.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:90%
This is not a good idea.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we're
tampering with the body,

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:90%
tampering with the food supply.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:10%
Then we end up with this
incredible parade of diseases.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:10%
Diabetes-- 20 million
diabetics in this country.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And other 20 million
who are pre-diabetic.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.150 align:middle line:84%
80 million Americans have
hypertension, high blood

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.710 align:middle line:90%
pressure.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:84%
The number is about
70 million Americans

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
on psychotropic
drugs, and that's

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:84%
antidepressants, anxiolytics,
sleep problems, et cetera.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're tampering
with the food supply.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:90%
We're tampering with our body.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
We end up with all
of these diseases.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And my simple message is use
this body the way nature, God,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.100 align:middle line:90%
intended it to be.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Eat foods in as close to their
natural state in the diet

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:90%
that our ancestors consumed.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Which was a little bit
of meat, a whole lot

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:90%
of fruits and vegetables.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of whole
grains, and legumes, and nuts,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:90%
and seeds.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
A semi-vegetarian diet,
meaning a little bit

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:84%
of fish and chicken and
grass fed beef and lamb

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction with
mostly plant foods.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be eating a
lot of relatively unprocessed.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.497 align:middle line:84%
I stay away from gluten as
much as possible, less gluten.

00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
There are many other grains
that you can consume--

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.750 align:middle line:84%
rice and corn and
others that are

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.354 align:middle line:84%
far preferable to the
gluten intolerance

00:09:38.354 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:90%
issue that we're getting to.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.890 align:middle line:84%
The experiences I had with
cancer treatment centers,

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
10 years working with
thousands of patients,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.907 align:middle line:84%
show that nutrition can have a
huge impact in cancer outcome

00:09:49.907 --> 00:09:51.490 align:middle line:84%
while they're being
medically treated.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm not saying
nutrition is sole therapy.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Over 140,000 people die
a year from properly

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:90%
prescribe prescription drugs?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Quillin knows what
he's talking about.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.320 align:middle line:84%
He served his 10 years as
Vice President of Nutrition

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
for the Cancer Treatment
Centers of America.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.472 align:middle line:84%
He's written 17 books on health,
sold over 2 million copies.

00:10:10.472 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
So he definitely knows
what he's talking about.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Another expert on
nutrition is KC Craichy.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to what he has to
say about superfood nutrition,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.150 align:middle line:84%
coupled with
calorie restriction.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Super food nutrition is a
concept that I started working

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:90%
on in the '90s.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.839 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote, actually,
my first white paper

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
on the subject,
which I call the four

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
corners of optimal
nutrition at that point.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.522 align:middle line:10%
Now I refer to it as the
four corners of super food

00:10:33.522 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:10%
nutrition, because the piece
of superfruit nutrition that's

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:10%
so interesting is that superfood
nutrition, as we have defined

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:10%
it, is that we know in health
that there are something

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:10%
on the order of 50 to 53,
depends on how you slice them--

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:10%
by that I mean, some
people will argue

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.087 align:middle line:10%
about how many essential
vitamins there are,

00:10:52.087 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:10%
how many essential
minerals there are.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Some people say there's nine
essential amino acids, when

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:90%
others will say there's 10.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.499 align:middle line:84%
And if you add conditional
essentials, it might be 12.

00:11:00.499 --> 00:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So depending on
how you slice it,

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.292 align:middle line:84%
though, these things called
essential-- or in this case,

00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:07.750 align:middle line:84%
dietary essential-- means you
have to get it from your diet

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:90%
in order to get them.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:84%
The body can do anything
and make them nonessentials.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Now technically,
they're all essentials.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.734 align:middle line:84%
But the dietary essentials,
you must consume for the body

00:11:17.734 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
to use that as raw material
to make the other things

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:90%
that your body needs.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
not getting those 50

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.637 align:middle line:84%
plus essential
nutrients in your diet,

00:11:26.637 --> 00:11:28.720 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to have
physiologic consequences

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:84%
as a result. This
is the four corners

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
where we start with
calorie restriction

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:90%
with optimum nutrition.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, years ago, you may
remember the biosphere project

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.490 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Roy Wolfe with UCLA.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.326 align:middle line:84%
They were in the biosphere,
and there the whole thing

00:11:43.326 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
was about they were going to
grow the food that they use.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it was going to be a
self-sustained environment,

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.609 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't getting
anything in or out of it.

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:84%
They'd have to grow
what they needed.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, they had
something go wrong

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't grow
enough food for them.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So they had to ration what
they ate to have less food.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And while they were
hungry and all,

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
they found remarkable
physiological and psychological

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:90%
changes that were very positive.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And that really spawned the
whole calorie restriction

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, the calorie
restricting, fasting

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:90%
movement, and so on.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So the calorie restriction
with optimum nutrition--

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
there's now been more than
2,000 studies in virtually every

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
organism-- single organism all
the way up to primates and even

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:90%
in humans, now--

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that this is
positive for physiology.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.399 align:middle line:84%
That it actually is
like if you would

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
say if there was a
fountain of youth,

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:84%
it would be extended
life, delayed disease,

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
enhanced performance,
optimized weight,

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:39.880 align:middle line:90%
increased mental clarity.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And start going down
the list of things

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:84%
that were beneficial
from doing this approach.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:84%
When you now take
calorie restriction

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and you add optimal
nutrition, most people

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.600 align:middle line:84%
would agree that if
you eat less calories,

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
but you max out the nutrients
and get all these 51

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about at the same time,

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
that it has got be better
for you than either eating

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot of calorically dense
food or a little teeny

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.160 align:middle line:90%
bit of calorically dense food.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So that piece is a very
important piece of the puzzle.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a really cool study in
Journal of Nutrition in 2001.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's four groups of mice,
genetically altered mice,

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
altered to be more
susceptible to disease.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So the first group of
mice was they call it

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:90%
the all you could eat group.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.546 align:middle line:84%
So they gave it all the food
it could eat all the time,

00:13:26.546 --> 00:13:27.670 align:middle line:90%
so it'd graze all the time.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:84%
They also added corn
oil to the situation.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.610 align:middle line:10%
So these mice lived an
average of 232 days.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:10%
So 232 on the average.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the second
group, same kind

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.460 align:middle line:90%
of mice, same feeding method.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:84%
But all they did was instead of
corn oil, they gave fish oil.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Fish oil, and they live an
average of 100 days longer.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Just adding the fish oil.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.574 align:middle line:84%
It's still garbage
food underneath,

00:13:49.574 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:90%
if you think about it.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So the third group was the
calorie restriction group.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.970 align:middle line:84%
They take the same food,
same feeding method,

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:84%
but they actually cut the
calorie of the food by 40%.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
They lived an average
of 200 days longer

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
than the 232 day
control, just by eating

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.730 align:middle line:84%
less of that unhealthy
food they were eating.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
The last of the four groups was
the calorie restriction group

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.300 align:middle line:90%
combined with fish oil.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And this group lived an
average of 400 days longer

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:90%
than the 232 day control.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So 600 something days
versus 200 something days.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's a fascinating
little study.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:26.219 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
if you're a mouse,

00:14:26.219 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:84%
you really ought to be thinking
about this kind of nutrition.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this does
translate in a lot of ways.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It just shows how high impact
that nutrition could actually

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.640 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So the mice that ate
the buffet of GMO foods,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.419 align:middle line:84%
and they had all that they
wanted, lived 232 days.

00:14:41.419 --> 00:14:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But the mice that were
eating healthy foods

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
with limited quantities,
the calorie restriction,

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:90%
they lived 632 days.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.525 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty amazing.

00:14:48.525 --> 00:14:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, in an earlier episode
about the immune system,

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.066 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
the way that sugar

00:14:52.066 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
affects our body and the way
it affects the immune system

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and compromises it.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And the way that it
feeds cancer cells.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
But what about fruits
and vegetables?

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't they contain
natural sugar?

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Tony Jimenez shed some light
on this important question.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to tell you something
about nutrition that is quite

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:90%
controversial.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.710 align:middle line:10%
It's a Tony concept.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:10%
We are writing a paper.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:84%
By we, I mean my chief
science officer, Dr.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Subrata Chakravarty-- those
smart Indians, two PhDs--

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:90%
and myself.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:90%
This is the concept--

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
cancer cells can only
assimilate R spin molecules,

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:90%
R spin sugars.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.434 align:middle line:84%
Those are sugars that
rotate to the right.

00:15:40.434 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:90%
So Ty, let me ask you.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Have you taken an amino acid?

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Like what, Ty?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:10%
>> I've taken lysine many times.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, lysine.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:48.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle line:10%
Anytime I get like a
fever blister on my mouth,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:10%
I'll take a few lysines.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.320 align:middle line:84%
The others were R carnitine,
methionine, proline.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So what's the letter in
front of that amino acid?

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:90%
>> L.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.940 align:middle line:10%
>> L. Let's discuss
what L means.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:10%
L stands for levorotatory.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:90%
That means left spin.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
So the molecules in the
lysine that you have taken

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:90%
are spinning to the left.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said
cancer cells can only

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.710 align:middle line:84%
assimilate right spin
molecules-- so that's

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:90%
the opposite.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Human mammalian cells can only
absorb left spin molecules.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:33.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why you take an L
lysine, not an R lysine.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
The difference with cancer
cells is that they could only

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:90%
absorb right spin molecules--

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:90%
right spin sugars.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:90%
What are the right spin sugars?

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:90%
The processed sugars.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:90%
The white sugars.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.590 align:middle line:90%
That enriched sugars.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:90%
The synthetic sugars.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So at Hope4Cancer, we
allow our patients,

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
in moderation, as
everything should be,

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:84%
to eat organic, pesticide
free, clean, natural fruits.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:10%
Because when God places
fruits in the Garden of Eden,

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:11.079 align:middle line:10%
they are left spin molecules.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:10%
Of these, thou shall eat.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:20.650 align:middle line:10%
So they are helping
our normal cells.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.950 align:middle line:10%
When man fools with all this--

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.874 align:middle line:10%
we're in California
in this interview--

00:17:24.874 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:10%
in California,
they have something

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:10%
called the Grapple,
which is a combination

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.032 align:middle line:10%
of an apple and a grape, right?

00:17:30.032 --> 00:17:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It looks like an apple
and tastes like a grape.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:90%
That's not God-made.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So for sure, that has
an R spin, and don't

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:90%
take that if you have cancer.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:90%
But this is my concept.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:84%
That cancer patients can take
in moderation healthy sugars.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And we need healthy sugars, ?

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:10%
Right let's think
about a PET scan.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:90%
We know about PET scans.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:84%
What molecule are they,
or what contrast medium,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:90%
are they injecting?

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:90%
2-Deoxy-D-Glucose.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:90%
D-glucose are right spin sugar.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:90%
>> So the cancer cell absorbs--

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Can absorb it, and
the PET scan lights up.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:84%
So any right spin sugar,
it's an unnatural sugar.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So cancer patients--
in Dr. Tony's opinion,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:84%
and I respect what
they have to say.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:84%
You could have honey, maple
syrup, molasses, sugar cane

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
as long as it's natural,
unprocessed, unadulterated.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
free of pesticides

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not going
to feed cancer cells.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.770 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.774 align:middle line:84%
That really answers the
question that I hear a lot,

00:18:45.774 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it's kind of
hard to answer these questions.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.190 align:middle line:84%
People say, OK,
cancer feeds on sugar.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:90%
So is it OK eat blueberries?

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK to eat grapes?

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Is it OK to eat fruit,
because it has natural sugar?

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:84%
That explains why it would
be OK to eat natural fruits,

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.780 align:middle line:84%
whereas the processed
sugars are right spin.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:90%
The naturals are left spin.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Cancer absorbs the right
spin, not the left spin.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fascinating.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's look at another
viewpoint on this.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Gerson, Max Gerson--

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.995 align:middle line:90%
juicing.

00:19:18.995 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:84%
A juice every hour
in his therapy.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Five, six coffee enemas a day.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:84%
I know, I worked
with him years ago.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.822 align:middle line:90%
What was his main juice?

00:19:27.822 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:90%
One of his main juices?

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Carrot.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Carrot.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.544 align:middle line:84%
Isn't carrot a high
glycemic index?

00:19:32.544 --> 00:19:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> One of the highest.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>> One of the highest.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
But he knew that the carrot
juice and the sugar in that

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.780 align:middle line:84%
was not going to
feed cancer cells.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a left spin molecule.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fascinating.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And let's think of
another concept, Ty.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.190 align:middle line:10%
If sugar feeds cancer, and
it's as simple as that-- wow.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.800 align:middle line:10%
We don't need hyperthermia.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.532 align:middle line:84%
We won't need
photodynamic therapy.

00:19:54.532 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:90%
We don't need anything.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:84%
We know how to
starve cancer cells.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:90%
But isn't that easy.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
You think a cancer cell
is going to say, well,

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm not getting sugar.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get its
nutrients from proteins.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't give it sugar,
don't give it protein.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So what is the cancer
going to do now?

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting sugar,
I'm not getting protein.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.459 align:middle line:84%
It's going to get its
nutrients from fats.

00:20:21.459 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, don't give it sugar,
don't give it protein,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:90%
don't give it fat.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, the patient will starve.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:90%
You'll starve, right?

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:32.410 align:middle line:90%
So see, it's about the right--

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
not right, but the correct
types of sugars to use.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And always in moderation, and
balanced nutritional protocol.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And then getting rid of
all of the processed sugars.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that would
then feed the cancer.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Make it a lot easier for them to
get the nutrition, if you just

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
hand it to them on
a silver platter.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like adding
fuel to a fire, right?

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:84%
That's some fascinating
information from Dr. Jimenez--

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.220 align:middle line:90%
left spin versus right spin.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells feed on
right spin sugars.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.499 align:middle line:90%
Natural sugars are left spin.

00:21:02.499 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that information.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I tell you what--

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.570 align:middle line:84%
you learn something new
everyday, don't you?

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, this next interview
Dr. Robert Scott Bell

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:84%
shares with us
about the importance

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
of minerals in the diet,
specifically silica, chromium,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:90%
and selenium.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you think about
the superfoods, right?

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
foods may contain

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
high calories and some
minerals and vitamins.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.397 align:middle line:84%
They might not be as densely,
say proportionately speaking

00:21:24.397 --> 00:21:25.980 align:middle line:84%
there, because we've
got to counteract

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.780 align:middle line:90%
so much in our environment.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.434 align:middle line:10%
Where it may have been simple
enough to grow your own food

00:21:30.434 --> 00:21:32.100 align:middle line:10%
and eat all of the
food as it was grown,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:10%
I believe right
now we're dealing

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:10%
with extraordinary times.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe catastrophic in the
devastation of the environment.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, just
selecting certain foods

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that I think would be good--
like I'm not personally

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:90%
a big fan of beets.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I had an allergy
to it as a child.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe now looking back that
I wasn't allergic to beets,

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.180 align:middle line:84%
but because beets have such
a powerful beneficial impact

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.810 align:middle line:84%
to the liver, for instance, that
it was helping me to detoxify

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and it was misinterpreted
as an allergy, for instance.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great food.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Super foods and
super greens-- kale

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.210 align:middle line:84%
is an excellent,
excellent food that

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
contains a lot of good things.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Sea vegetation, if you
can find non-irradiated,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
non-contaminated forms
of sea vegetation--

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
and there are many
strains of this--

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:84%
create the most mineral
rich abundant superfoods

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.140 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to look
also at the mineral

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.140 align:middle line:84%
content of-- for the connective
tissue, I talked about silica.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.044 align:middle line:84%
Most of the foods,
unfortunately, that we eat

00:22:24.044 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:84%
have been robbed of
these trace elements

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
because industry has
found it much more

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
profitable to take
those minerals

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and use them for
different reasons.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.505 align:middle line:84%
And they leave us with
the deficient food.

00:22:33.505 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So we talk about
something like silica,

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
you can go to something like
the horsetail extract, something

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.510 align:middle line:84%
that you could grow
and make into a tea

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
yourself or concentrate in the
whole food form from a tea.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And now you have an
abundance of silica,

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.809 align:middle line:84%
which again, is one of those
trace minerals so critical.

00:22:46.809 --> 00:22:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And the only time you'll find
it in a health food store

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
is in the little beauty
section for women

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
that want to have better
nails, or hair, or skin.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.624 align:middle line:84%
And yet we ignore
the fact that it's

00:22:56.624 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:84%
the integrity of the entire
connective tissue of the body.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.830 align:middle line:84%
The vascular system,
as well, is dependent

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
upon that humble
trace element that's

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.400 align:middle line:90%
been removed from most foods.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.980 align:middle line:84%
We talk about foods
like whole grains

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that used to contain
abundant amounts of chromium.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
robbed of the chromium,

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
because the soils don't contain
it or industry refines it out.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Chromium-- why do we need that?

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
The form that I talk
about is grown as food,

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:90%
because it manages what?

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Sugar.

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Blood sugar.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It helps to deliver it
successfully into the cells,

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.297 align:middle line:84%
and mobilize it out
of the cells should

00:23:27.297 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:84%
we need it if we don't
have enough coming in

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:90%
from external sources.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.390 align:middle line:90%
And then we see the--

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
as Dr. Bittar calls it, the
obligate glucose metabolizer--

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.110 align:middle line:90%
cancer--

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.640 align:middle line:84%
really taking
advantage of the fact

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:90%
that we are chromium deficient.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
It has access to the
sugar very readily,

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
have the chromium

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:84%
necessary to bind it and
help deliver it so the cancer

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:90%
cells can't get it.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:90%
So that'd be another aspect.

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Other foods, like Brazil
nuts, are rich in selenium.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Although we see as well,
now, lower than it was.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.054 align:middle line:84%
And we need for real metabolic
benefit of selenium higher

00:24:00.054 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
quantities than
we're getting just

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:84%
from Brazil nuts
and other foods.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So concentrating the selenium
in a food grown source or form

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:90%
is going to be critical.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Utilizing upwards of 200
micrograms a day, bare minimum,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.910 align:middle line:90%
is preventive maintenance.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But upwards of 400, 600,
800, or even 1000 micrograms

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:84%
of this food grown
form of selenium

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.350 align:middle line:84%
to reverse the cancer like no
other trace mineral can do.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And rather than believe the
FDA and their corrupt study

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.326 align:middle line:84%
of yesteryear that says
selenium can be toxic to you,

00:24:28.326 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:84%
the form that
we're talking about

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.160 align:middle line:84%
is not a synthetic isolyte
of food grown form.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
We can take large quantities
without concerning yourself

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.810 align:middle line:84%
with selenium toxicity,
and it will greatly

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.455 align:middle line:84%
benefit the cancer patients
almost more than anything else.

00:24:39.455 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the
things that Dr.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Robert Scott Bell just mentioned
was minimally rich vegetation.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:90%
So to take a guess--

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.210 align:middle line:90%
sea vegetation?

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.689 align:middle line:84%
What would you guess what the
minerals that it's rich in?

00:24:49.689 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I know the first thing you're
thinking-- iodine, right?

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Kelp has lots of iodine.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.720 align:middle line:84%
So we talked to Dr. David
Brownstein about iodine

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and the importance of
iodine in overall health,

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
specifically with
the thyroid gland.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
What is iodine, and do we
need it to prevent cancer?

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about-- let's
do the basics on people--

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.630 align:middle line:84%
to help supply their
body with the things

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
it needs to function
optimally, which is how

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.420 align:middle line:90%
we were designed by our maker.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:84%
If we supply the body
with the right nutrients,

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
it should do fine
for a lifetime.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:10%
So I consider one of
the basics iodine.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:10%
Every cell in the body
needs and requires

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:10%
iodine to function optimally.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.240 align:middle line:10%
We can't function optimally
in an iodine deficient

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:10%
environment.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And I've tested, along with my
partners, over 6,000 patients.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:90%
Over 96% were low on iodine.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority,
significantly low on iodine.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk to
clinicians around

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
the country who are
looking at this,

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.390 align:middle line:84%
they find the same
numbers that I'm finding.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.205 align:middle line:90%
Iodine's main job in the body--

00:25:50.205 --> 00:25:51.917 align:middle line:84%
iodine has a lot of
jobs in the body.

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The immune system can't
function without it.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't fight
infections without it.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But one of its main jobs
is in the endocrine glands.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And the endocrine glands
include the thyroid, the breast,

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
the ovaries, uterus,
and the prostate.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
What are we having
problems with out there?

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.209 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid, the ovaries,
uterus, breast, and prostate.

00:26:10.209 --> 00:26:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I've mentioned the prostate,
I've mentioned the breast.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.458 align:middle line:84%
The fastest growing cancer
in the United States

00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:90%
is thyroid cancer.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
We have uterine ovarian cancer
growing at epidemic rates.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:90%
All of these tissues are--

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.625 align:middle line:84%
we're having epidemic rates
of problems with them.

00:26:22.625 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Iodine's main job is to
maintain the normal architecture

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.155 align:middle line:90%
of those tissues.

00:26:26.155 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And iodine deficiency, the
first thing that happens

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.070 align:middle line:84%
is you get cystic formation
in the breast, the ovaries,

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:90%
uterus, thyroid, prostate.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And let's throw in the pancreas
in here as well, which is also

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:90%
increasing at epidemic rates--

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:90%
pancreatic cancer.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.236 align:middle line:84%
And those cysts
start to form when

00:26:41.236 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:90%
iodine deficiency is there.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.230 align:middle line:84%
If it goes on longer, they
become nodular and hard.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
If it comes on longer,
they become hyperplasia--

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:84%
hyperplastic tissue-- which
is the precursor to cancer.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And I say that's the iodine
deficiency continuum.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:84%
The good thing about
iodine is iodine has

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.307 align:middle line:84%
apoptotic properties, meaning it
can stop a cell, a cancer cell,

00:27:00.307 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:84%
from just continually
dividing, dividing, dividing

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:90%
until it kills somebody.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So iodine can stop
this continuum

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:84%
wherever it catches it,
and hopefully reverse it,

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
but at least put the
brakes on what's happening.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And know over 80% of women
suffer from fibrocystic breast

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
That's a precursor
to breast cancer.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Which as I said,
one in seven women.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I say it's an iodine
deficiency problem period.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And we either recognize
this and start treating it,

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:84%
or we're still going to see
one in seven women with breast

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.950 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I knew that iodine
was important.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I did not know that it creates
apoptosis in the cancer cells.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Iodine has been shown to have
apoptotic properties for cancer

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Iodine has been shown to
be effective for treating

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:84%
a multitude of cancers--
all those tissues

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned before,
including pancreatic cancer,

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:90%
including some brain cancers.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:84%
It's too bad that the
cancer industrial complex

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:57.710 align:middle line:84%
isn't studying iodine as
a good therapy for cancer,

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:90%
because they should be.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.186 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
should be studied,

00:28:01.186 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and I think it should
be studied number

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.020 align:middle line:90%
one, as a therapy for cancer.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And number two, as a
preventive for cancer.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:07.549 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense, especially
in light of the fact

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that you've shown
the way that iodine

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.059 align:middle line:90%
affects the endocrine system.

00:28:13.059 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And the endocrine
glands are the ones

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.830 align:middle line:84%
that we're having
the problems with.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:17.540 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, Ty, I've written
about this extensively

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:10%
in my book, Iodine--

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.463 align:middle line:10%
Why You Need It and Why
You Can't Live Without It.

00:28:20.463 --> 00:28:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I did a study where I
looked at 18 women--

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:84%
nine had breast cancer, nine
did not have breast cancer.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And I measured their
iodine and bromide levels.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was a test
where we collected the urine.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I found was
before any therapy,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.240 align:middle line:84%
the breast cancer women
had half as much iodine

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:90%
as the non-breast cancer women.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.997 align:middle line:84%
Now, they were
all low in iodine,

00:28:44.997 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:84%
but the breast cancer
women were lower

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.960 align:middle line:84%
than the non-breast
cancer women.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I gave them 50 milligrams
of iodine for 30 days,

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:90%
and then I rechecked them.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.680 align:middle line:84%
What I found at the
end of 30 days--

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.763 align:middle line:84%
and there was one other
check in the middle there.

00:28:56.763 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
But what I found was that
the breast cancer women

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:84%
had much more bromide,
much less iodine,

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:84%
than the non-breast
cancer women.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And iodine is part of the
halide family, which includes

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.980 align:middle line:90%
iodine, bromide, and fluoride.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, out of those three, iodine
is the only essential element

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.674 align:middle line:84%
that has therapeutic
value in the body.

00:29:16.674 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Bromide and fluoride,
as far as we know,

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
has no known therapeutic
value in the body.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And bromide we're
getting in toxic amounts

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:27.954 align:middle line:90%
in our environment.

00:29:27.954 --> 00:29:29.870 align:middle line:84%
We're getting toxic
amounts in our food supply

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:90%
from brominated vegetable oils.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Many medicines contain
bromide as part

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of their chemical makeup.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.855 align:middle line:84%
And what I found in testing
every breast cancer--

00:29:38.855 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:84%
I haven't tested every
breast cancer patient,

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.010 align:middle line:84%
but the ones that
I've tested, 100%

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.560 align:middle line:84%
have high bromide levels
and low iodine levels.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
I've tested over 1,000
patients in general,

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.580 align:middle line:90%
some with cancer, some without.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:84%
They all have high
bromide levels.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:84%
The cancer patients generally
have higher amounts of bromide.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Animal studies have shown
bromide can push iodine out

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:58.514 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:29:58.514 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Bromide can bind where
iodine binds too,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and bromide gums up the cells
and it doesn't work well.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And what we need is more
iodine in our bodies.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we're
going to get it right now

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:84%
is supplementation, just
because we're getting too much

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.300 align:middle line:90%
in our food and our drink.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's in a bunch
of consumer goods,

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.072 align:middle line:90%
such as computers and cars.

00:30:18.072 --> 00:30:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And you're probably
wearing it in your clothing

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:23.010 align:middle line:90%
right now as a fire retardant.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:84%
So iodine needs to be a
continual supplement regimen

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.880 align:middle line:90%
for, I think, everybody.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I'm
seeing right now,

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.674 align:middle line:84%
we're getting too much
bromide, not enough iodine.

00:30:33.674 --> 00:30:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting too much
fluoride from our water supply.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.754 align:middle line:90%
That's another story, too.

00:30:37.754 --> 00:30:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing
about iodine is

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
iodine can kick
out both of those

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:90%
if we start ingesting it again.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And so why do you think it
is that so many people are

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:90%
deficient in iodine?

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.262 align:middle line:84%
I know one study that I
read, or one article I read.

00:30:50.262 --> 00:30:51.470 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember who it was--

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it may have
been Dr. Blaylock--

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:56.840 align:middle line:84%
was writing about in the
'70s they took bromine out

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
of the bread and
started putting in--

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
or they took iodine
out of the bread

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.540 align:middle line:90%
and started putting in bromine.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that was me
who wrote about that.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Was that you?

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:04.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.088 align:middle line:84%
>> That's in my iodine book,
and I've written a bunch

00:31:07.088 --> 00:31:08.030 align:middle line:90%
of articles on that.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Before the 1970s, iodine
was used in bakery products

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:90%
as a conditioning agent.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.480 align:middle line:10%
And for some reason
in the early 1970s,

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.510 align:middle line:10%
they substituted
bromide for iodine.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.630 align:middle line:10%
And it's not clear why.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.380 align:middle line:84%
But we started to get
all this bromide now

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.930 align:middle line:84%
at our bakery products--
every slice of bread, cracker,

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:84%
cookie, cake now have
bromide instead of iodine.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.196 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look at the breast
cancer rates and the prostate

00:31:30.196 --> 00:31:31.820 align:middle line:84%
cancer rates, when
they really took off

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:90%
was right about that time frame.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So I say that's when
our iodine levels really

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.220 align:middle line:90%
fell off the cliff.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And then what's
also happened lately

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is our soil has become
more deficient in iodine.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, I live in a nice
area, a suburb of Detroit.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.547 align:middle line:84%
And the Great Lakes
area where I live,

00:31:49.547 --> 00:31:51.380 align:middle line:84%
our soil is one of the
most iodine deficient

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.504 align:middle line:90%
areas of the world.

00:31:52.504 --> 00:31:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not just
the Great Lakes area.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.586 align:middle line:84%
If you draw a line
down the center

00:31:55.586 --> 00:31:59.240 align:middle line:84%
of the country between
the coasts, most of it

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:84%
is iodine deficient,
except for the two coasts.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Where you live is a very iodine
deficient area of the world.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So this has been going
on for a long time.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:84%
What's been going
on for a long time

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
is this exposure to bromide and
fluoride, which has exacerbated

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:90%
this iodine deficiency problem.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think exacerbated the
breast, prostate, thyroid,

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.130 align:middle line:84%
ovarian, uterine, pancreatic
problems that we're seeing now.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So the US government
recognized iodine deficiency

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:24.560 align:middle line:84%
was a big problem in
the 1920s, as goiter

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.470 align:middle line:84%
was in epidemic rates in women,
especially in the Midwest area.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But really I have a
map, around 1915 goiter

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.140 align:middle line:90%
was around the whole country--

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:90%
north, south, east, and west.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.490 align:middle line:10%
So there was a study
done, and the government

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:10%
recommended they could put a
little bit of iodide in salt

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.274 align:middle line:10%
and take care of
this goiter epidemic.

00:32:43.274 --> 00:32:45.481 align:middle line:10%
Which they did, and it was
a very effective treatment

00:32:45.481 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:10%
to prevent goiter.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's still in salt now, it's
in refined salts as we know it.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.670 align:middle line:84%
The problem is only 10%
of the iodine in that salt

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:90%
is bioavailable for the body.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not a great way
to get iodine in.

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And then you couple it with
this bromide and fluoride

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.680 align:middle line:90%
overexposure that we're getting.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.640 align:middle line:90%
That's a recipe for disaster.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And salt is not the best
way to get iodine in.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.960 align:middle line:84%
At this point in our lives,
I think with our overexposure

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.119 align:middle line:84%
to bromide and fluoride, we
have to supplement with iodine.

00:33:12.119 --> 00:33:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
best way to supplement

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.850 align:middle line:84%
with it is either use Lugol's
solution, which has been around

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.800 align:middle line:90%
for almost 200 years.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Or tablet of Lugol's solution.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's forms of
tablet of Lugol's--

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.580 align:middle line:90%
iodoral is one of them.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Iodizyme-HP is another name for
a tablet of Lugol's product.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I've tested all of these
products, they're all fine.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
They're all made from
Lugol's solution.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a way to get it in.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it's impossible to
get enough in through our diet

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.090 align:middle line:84%
right now, in the
world we live in.

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And the best sources
of iodine in the diet

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:51.410 align:middle line:84%
are sea vegetables, such
as seaweed or ocean fish.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.432 align:middle line:84%
Now, ocean fish
do contain iodine.

00:33:53.432 --> 00:33:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem is the
longer that fish

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:84%
has been out of the
ocean, the less iodine

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
that fish has as it sublimates
out into a gaseous phase.

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And fish have other problems,
such as high mercury levels

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:03.890 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So I still think a
better way is we're

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.020 align:middle line:84%
going to need to supplement with
iodine with the cancer epidemic

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.460 align:middle line:90%
that we're having right now.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Average doses I find for people,
12 to 25 milligrams for most

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:14.969 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:84%
If they have breast, lung,
thyroid, prostate, ovarian,

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.000 align:middle line:84%
uterine problems
they may need more.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Brownstein is not the
only medical doctor that knows

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:26.219 align:middle line:84%
that iodine deficiency is a big
problem in the United States.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:28.489 align:middle line:84%
Another medical doctor that
we were able to talk to,

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Murray Buzz Sussar,
shares his insight.

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.066 align:middle line:84%
What's a good diet that
you would recommend

00:34:34.066 --> 00:34:36.440 align:middle line:84%
to your patients that may be
compromised, because they've

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
been eating crap
their whole life?

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No sugar.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.943 align:middle line:90%
And the other thing is no sugar.

00:34:40.943 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And the other thing is no sugar.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:10%
>> We said before that the
cancer cells consume sugar

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:10%
at about 19 times as
fast as healthy cells.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So then the
question is no junk.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Wholesome foods.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:90%
You can eat animal foods.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
the vegetarian diet.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.340 align:middle line:90%
Some people do.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people who
really seem to waste away

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:90%
on a vegetarian diet.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I think you can do
a low meat diet,

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:17.100 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to have enough
protein to rebuild your cells.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And so you need some
animal food, I believe.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:84%
You could probably do what is a
diet for a small planet, where

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.450 align:middle line:90%
you could, if you blend--

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:84%
remember that book, "Diet
For a Small Planet"?

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.860 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
first nutritional books

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.810 align:middle line:84%
about cancer and about
nutrition in general.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:84%
That if you combine
beans and grains,

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.870 align:middle line:90%
you can get a complete protein.

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Because vegetarian proteins
never have all the amino acids

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.200 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you combine beans and
grains, then you can have both.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to try to do
something low in animal food,

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.100 align:middle line:90%
read "Diet For a Small Planet."

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:10%
And be sure that you get
enough of the broad spectrum

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:06.820 align:middle line:10%
of amino acids.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:84%
There are 20 or 22,
depending on who

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.790 align:middle line:84%
you believe, amino acids that
are essential to our body.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:84%
All but about eight of
them we can make ourselves.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.720 align:middle line:90%
So eight, or arguably 10.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>> The jury's out on that still.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:24.212 --> 00:36:26.670 align:middle line:84%
Which you wouldn't think, in
this day and age, it would be.

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:10%
>> But let's say you need 10
amino acids that are considered

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.920 align:middle line:10%
to be essential, because
we can't make them.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:10%
We have to eat them.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And so if we have a complete
diet of amino acids,

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.330 align:middle line:84%
all the good fatty acids--
the omega-3, omega-6, omega-9

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:90%
in the right proportion.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
good starches.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And the good starches.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:84%
One of the best
foods is watercress.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Watercress?

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.620 align:middle line:90%
It's high in sulforaphanes.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Sulforaphanes
are plant enzymes--

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:16.020 align:middle line:10%
plant hormones, actually,
that fight infection,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.870 align:middle line:10%
that fight damage.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you crush a plant,
it releases sulforaphanes.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:84%
So sulfur is one
of the best ways

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to fight invaders, like
cancer or infection.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Watercress.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Watercress is like arugula.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.890 align:middle line:10%
Those are the
cruciferous vegetables.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.129 align:middle line:10%
>> So I like those.

00:37:44.129 --> 00:37:46.170 align:middle line:10%
And you can overdo those,
also, because then they

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:10%
start binding iodine, and
your thyroid gets depleted.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Iodine, by the way, is
another important item that

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.500 align:middle line:90%
we're very neglectful of.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I treat almost every one
of my patients with iodine.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:04.320 align:middle line:84%
The recommended daily allowance
of iodine is 160 micrograms.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a product that has 20
milligrams per drop, SSKI.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's-- what
Dr. Brownstein said,

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:84%
was anywhere from 12
to 25 milligrams a day.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>> He's from UCLA?

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know where
he went to school.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he's smarter
than most of us.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>> He's a smart guy.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>> But you are too.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't go to UCLA.

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.343 align:middle line:90%
>> A lot of smart fellows.

00:38:29.343 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:90%
But you went to Pitt.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.490 align:middle line:84%
UCLA versus Pitt-- now that
would be a good football game,

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:34.290 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't it?

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're not talking
about football here.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.080 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about cancer.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.600 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Sunil Pai is another
conventionally trained

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:84%
medical doctor that has
stepped outside the box,

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.372 align:middle line:84%
and is now using nutrition
to help people get healthy.

00:38:45.372 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to
what he has to say.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> My background, I'm an M.D.
So I'm conventionally trained

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:50.340 align:middle line:90%
in family medicine.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:84%
But I did a fellowship
with Andrew Weil

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.900 align:middle line:84%
14 years ago in
integrative medicine.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But further than that,
I then went to India

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.659 align:middle line:84%
and studied a little bit
more of Ayurvedic medicine.

00:38:59.659 --> 00:39:01.950 align:middle line:10%
Ayurvedic medicine is the
traditional medicine of India

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.749 align:middle line:10%
that dates back
almost 5,000 years.

00:39:04.749 --> 00:39:07.290 align:middle line:10%
And many of the things that I
spoke about in my lecture today

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:11.600 align:middle line:10%
is rooted in that old history
of what we use food as medicine.

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.550 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people think
of Hippocrates saying,

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.340 align:middle line:84%
let medicine be thy food,
and food they medicine.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.710 align:middle line:90%
It goes further than that.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So he snagged it
from someone else.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody thinks that
history started with the Greeks

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.010 align:middle line:90%
and Romans.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:25.843 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
history than that, right?

00:39:25.843 --> 00:39:27.600 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
school you went to.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So we look at a
variety of things.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the main ingredients,
or natural therapies,

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that has been very
effective-- and now

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that we have a
preponderance of data

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.280 align:middle line:84%
in terms of clinical
efficacy, in terms

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.540 align:middle line:84%
of cell culture, animal studies,
now in human clinical trials.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Many of the ingredients I spoke
about today, such as curcumin.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Curcumin is an ingredient
that comes from turmeric.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.630 align:middle line:90%
And turmeric is a root.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.740 align:middle line:90%
We use it in cooking.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.610 align:middle line:90%
So we think of curry.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.235 align:middle line:84%
It's a spice, but
it's not spicy.

00:39:56.235 --> 00:39:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
have a misperception

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.119 align:middle line:90%
that, oh, it's spicy.

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:01.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a spice,
but it's not spicy.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have the heat
component, like a chili,

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But we use it in
yellow curry, if you

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:08.869 align:middle line:90%
went to a Thai restaurant.

00:40:08.869 --> 00:40:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Or when people have mustard,
what makes it yellow

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:12.440 align:middle line:90%
is turmeric powder.

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.384 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately
in American cooking

00:40:14.384 --> 00:40:17.050 align:middle line:84%
it's used as a colorant, because
it does have that yellow color.

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural color.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.540 align:middle line:84%
But it has a variety
of other benefits.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
benefits is that it's

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.110 align:middle line:90%
a strong anti-inflammatory.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And it now has been
shown to block over

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.180 align:middle line:84%
97 different mechanisms
of inflammation.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:34.037 align:middle line:84%
And so eating it as a food or
even taking it as a supplement

00:40:34.037 --> 00:40:35.120 align:middle line:90%
has a variety of benefits.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And we can see a lot of data
showing the support in use

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:42.620 align:middle line:84%
of why we have used this
historically in our past,

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and also now what we use
now in clinical trials

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:46.650 align:middle line:90%
as a supplement.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And many companies
now are looking

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.440 align:middle line:84%
at how to do it
pharmaceutically as well.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Most of the data
right now-- there's

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:57.390 align:middle line:84%
5,000 published studies on
the benefits of curcuminoids.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But now in the last 10
years, there's a lot of data

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.070 align:middle line:84%
now on how that affects
cancer cell growth.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And through these
mechanisms of inflammation,

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:84%
like NF-kB, which I talked
about today, one of the major

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.760 align:middle line:90%
switches of the immune system.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.909 align:middle line:90%
COX enzymes, LOX enzymes.

00:41:10.909 --> 00:41:12.700 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
we take certain drugs

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.840 align:middle line:84%
like, say, ibuprofen,
Motrin, Advil, Celebrex.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.340 align:middle line:84%
But the nice thing
with the curcumin

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.800 align:middle line:84%
is that we have no GI,
kidney, or liver side effects.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So we can take this in
higher doses or lower doses.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And even-- I didn't
mention it today,

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.100 align:middle line:84%
but I forgot to mention
that India, for example,

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:84%
has the lowest dementia
rates in the world.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And one of the issues that
we're looking at, well why?

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.735 align:middle line:84%
As a culture, it's not that
they are smarter people,

00:41:34.735 --> 00:41:36.610 align:middle line:84%
it's that we're finding
out that they consume

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:40.270 align:middle line:84%
about 25 to 50 milligrams
of tumeric daily

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:41.630 align:middle line:90%
over their lifetime.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And that prevents
inflammation of the brain.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.760 align:middle line:90%
That's very interesting.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.218 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
things that I heard

00:41:47.218 --> 00:41:49.900 align:middle line:84%
you say earlier in
your lecture was

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that the gold, frankincense and
myrrh in the Bible, the gold

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:54.450 align:middle line:90%
could have been turmeric?

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> From what we're
looking at historically,

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.710 align:middle line:84%
the gold maybe
references turmeric.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.159 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric, or you know
curcumin, specifically

00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:03.200 align:middle line:90%
the part of the turmeric.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But turmeric was sold and cost
more than gold at the time.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.160 align:middle line:84%
This was during the spice
trade, or the trade route.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.645 align:middle line:84%
And it was always nicknamed
the golden spice, we'd say.

00:42:12.645 --> 00:42:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
lot of reference

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.890 align:middle line:84%
that the myrrh-- you
know, myrrh is guggul.

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Which is not the website,
but the G-U-G-G-U-L.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.830 align:middle line:84%
some people here of guggul lipid
as a product or products out

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:23.630 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.004 align:middle line:84%
Guggul as an ayurvedic herb
has anti-inflammatory effects

00:42:26.004 --> 00:42:29.007 align:middle line:84%
and cardiovascular benefits,
like lowering cholesterol.

00:42:29.007 --> 00:42:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And then finally frankincense,
which is boswellia.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.656 align:middle line:84%
So they are the
three main herbs that

00:42:33.656 --> 00:42:35.530 align:middle line:84%
were brought-- you know,
the gift of the Magi

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.864 align:middle line:90%
came from wise men.

00:42:37.864 --> 00:42:40.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you go into a few
of the mechanisms of action

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.405 align:middle line:84%
for boswellia, the way that
it might reduce inflammation?

00:42:42.405 --> 00:42:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So boswellias
also block NF-kB.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.350 align:middle line:84%
It's also a 5-LOX
enzyme, so there's

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:84%
two main pathways in the
arachidonic acid pathway

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.270 align:middle line:84%
in terms of when we get
omega-6s from our diet, which

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.070 align:middle line:90%
I talked about.

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We should be eating a
plant based protein diet,

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.380 align:middle line:84%
meaning less animal protein
as possible and less highly

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.120 align:middle line:90%
refined oils.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But too much of those
trigger more inflammation,

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and then people
end up taking pills

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:90%
that are blocking inflammation.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.835 align:middle line:84%
Boswellia does that naturally
on one of the main pathways

00:43:08.835 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:90%
called 5-LOX.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:14.620 align:middle line:84%
It also has certain blocking
aspects of what they call VEGF.

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.980 align:middle line:84%
These are vascular endothelial
growth factors for cancer cells

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.210 align:middle line:90%
to grow.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And also blocks a variety
of transcription factors

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.756 align:middle line:90%
and enzyme processes.

00:43:22.756 --> 00:43:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing
is that's also

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.140 align:middle line:90%
been tested in many tissues--

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.190 align:middle line:90%
breast, bone.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Brain, for example,
is one of the areas

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that we study a lot where brain
tumors, like glioblastoma, have

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.530 align:middle line:90%
been shown to actually shrink.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And we have a handful
of patients now

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.110 align:middle line:84%
that are the longest surviving
glioblastoma recurrent

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:84%
patients in one of the big
hospitals in New York state,

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.690 align:middle line:90%
for your state history

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure I know which one.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.602 align:middle line:90%
>> We all know.

00:43:49.602 --> 00:43:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's with Boswellia?

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Boswellia.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So the gold that the magi
gave to the baby Jesus

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.820 align:middle line:84%
may have actually
been curcumin--

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.209 align:middle line:90%
the golden spice.

00:43:58.209 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard that
before, but it's definitely

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.583 align:middle line:90%
within the realm of possibility.

00:44:01.583 --> 00:44:02.635 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:44:02.635 --> 00:44:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Another conventionally
trained medical doctor

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:07.474 align:middle line:84%
who stepped outside the
box is Dr. Roby Mitchell.

00:44:07.474 --> 00:44:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to
what he has to say

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:11.320 align:middle line:84%
about the importance
of an anti-fungal diet

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.640 align:middle line:90%
in treating disease.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.634 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be a
diet, a general diet,

00:44:14.634 --> 00:44:17.050 align:middle line:84%
that you could recommend that
would keep the immune system

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:19.160 align:middle line:90%
strong and prevent cancer?

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.900 align:middle line:10%
>> So when I started
working with Dr. Wright,

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:28.210 align:middle line:10%
one of the things that I had
been involved with was treating

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:33.280 align:middle line:10%
people for the fungal overgrowth
that happens in our body.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I
started to realize--

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that I
realized years before that

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.080 align:middle line:84%
was that the common
denominator of any

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:50.850 align:middle line:84%
of these natural herbal
plant exotic fruit

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:84%
superfood remedies that
work, the common denominator

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:58.600 align:middle line:84%
with them was that they had some
powerful anti-fungal in them.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what garlic,
that's with aspirin,

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.520 align:middle line:84%
that's with these
polyphenolic compounds

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.230 align:middle line:90%
in the skin of red grapes.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:08.530 align:middle line:90%
You know, the resveratrol.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the lab, and I
started investigating, well,

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:84%
which foods are the
highest in these--

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:18.280 align:middle line:84%
or not necessarily
which was the highest,

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.570 align:middle line:84%
but which foods had the most
impact on controlling candida

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.700 align:middle line:90%
overgrowth.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I set up Petri dishes
right there in the lab,

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:32.110 align:middle line:84%
and we inoculated
them with candida.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we just went
about inoculating them then

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:39.190 align:middle line:84%
with extracts from different
fruits and vegetables

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and so forth to
see which ones made

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the biggest what we call zone
of exclusion in the Petri dish.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we had the Petri
control down here,

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.810 align:middle line:84%
with a medication
called Diflucan,

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:55.152 align:middle line:90%
that we know kills yeast.

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we knew that
it was going to leave

00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:00.520 align:middle line:84%
a big clear space in there where
it didn't allow yeast to grow.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And then down here,
we had just water.

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And so that plate just grew
white with yeast overgrowth

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.440 align:middle line:84%
because there was
nothing to inhibit it.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And then all these
other plates I

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:14.020 align:middle line:84%
was able to see which ones
worked better or worse

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.030 align:middle line:90%
at keeping yeast under control.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:20.380 align:middle line:84%
So with that, that was the
springboard for what is now

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.000 align:middle line:90%
called the BALI eating plan--

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.040 align:middle line:84%
B-A-L-I. And BALI stands for--
it's an acronym for Basic

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Antioxidants/Antifungal,
and then Low Insulin.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.400 align:middle line:90%
So we want to--

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and regardless of the name
that you can call it--

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.570 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's the Gerson
therapy, or the paleo diet,

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.000 align:middle line:84%
or Mediterranean
diet or whatever.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.980 align:middle line:84%
What is going to work as
far as keeping cells out

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.860 align:middle line:84%
of an environment that incense
them to pleomorph into cancer

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.280 align:middle line:84%
cells is one that keeps
the yeast under control.

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.060 align:middle line:84%
It keeps you from developing
fungal overgrowth.

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Because when that fungus
gets up to a certain level,

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:05.170 align:middle line:84%
then your immune system is going
to respond with the weapons

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.190 align:middle line:90%
of mass destruction.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to create
a toxic environment,

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and your cells are
going to cough and choke

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to start changing

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:14.980 align:middle line:84%
into a cellular form that
will allow them to survive

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.810 align:middle line:90%
that toxic environment.

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So again, regardless of what you
call it, the food that you eat

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.400 align:middle line:84%
has to be food that keeps
fungal growth under control

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't throw
gasoline on the fire.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So when we eat
foods that have what

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.640 align:middle line:90%
we call a high glycemic index--

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.880 align:middle line:84%
so the grains and the
sugars, corn, wheat,

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.100 align:middle line:90%
rice those things--

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.770 align:middle line:84%
then we're creating
an environment that

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.265 align:middle line:90%
promotes fungal overgrowth.

00:47:43.265 --> 00:47:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
cause inflammation,

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.598 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to,
again, incense cells

00:47:46.598 --> 00:47:48.200 align:middle line:90%
to turn into cancer cells.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.850 align:middle line:84%
So we have just seen that more
and more, as our diets have

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:53.361 align:middle line:90%
gotten more and more refined.

00:47:53.361 --> 00:47:55.860 align:middle line:84%
That was over here-- started
over here in the Western world.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we see it as we have
outsourced all of our computer

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:03.352 align:middle line:84%
jobs and manufacturing jobs
over to these third worlds,

00:48:03.352 --> 00:48:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and they get money
in their pocket.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we send Coke and
McDonald's over there.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.799 align:middle line:84%
Now we're seeing breast
cancer, for instance, in women

00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't see
breast cancer in before.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.054 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing prostate
cancer in men

00:48:13.054 --> 00:48:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't see
prostate cancer

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.270 align:middle line:84%
in before in these
third world countries.

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's, again, because they're
eating the same food that

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.520 align:middle line:90%
gave us the problem over here.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to get food
that's close to nature.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:28.600 align:middle line:10%
So lots and lots of
vegetables, lots of--

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.210 align:middle line:10%
fruits are OK, but you've got
to be careful about fruits.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.930 align:middle line:10%
Because fruits can have
a high sugar index.

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.640 align:middle line:84%
But fruits have lots of
wonderful nutrients, also.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I do have people that eat
protein, some protein,

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:46.210 align:middle line:84%
but you should not be eating
more than 60 grams of protein

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:48.370 align:middle line:84%
a day, because it
overwhelms the system

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.210 align:middle line:90%
and creates inflammation.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.410 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of sources
for protein now.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:55.750 align:middle line:84%
There's probably 10
wonderful vegetables

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.440 align:middle line:90%
that have protein sources.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Then if people just have to have
meat, it should be grass fed--

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.910 align:middle line:90%
a couple of ounces.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:05.830 align:middle line:84%
If they have chicken,
it's free range.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, all
the fish is tainted

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
with mercury and
radiation, so it's

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:12.950 align:middle line:90%
hard to recommend that anymore.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It used to be a great protein
source, but it's not now.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.390 align:middle line:84%
We have to eat foods
that help us detoxify.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We have to have foods that
help us provide the energy.

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.910 align:middle line:84%
We put all of our
patients on wheatgrass.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Wheatgrass is the most powerful
food that people can eat.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:84%
All of our cancer patients,
whether they are at home

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.770 align:middle line:84%
or whether they're
in our clinic,

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.690 align:middle line:84%
they get wheatgrass
every single day.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I love wheatgrass shots.

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:37.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, wheatgrass is wonderful.

00:49:37.879 --> 00:49:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Juicing-- a lot of people, if
they've undergone chemotherapy,

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.520 align:middle line:84%
the gastrointestinal
system isn't working.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So we have to do
the work for them.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So we give them juicing so they
quickly absorb the nutrients

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.320 align:middle line:90%
they need to.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Some people need
to put on weight.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So I have people that
need to put on weight,

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.870 align:middle line:90%
I put them on a special program.

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.252 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on everything, but
one thing is most of your plate

00:49:59.252 --> 00:50:01.210 align:middle line:84%
is going to be vegetables
and a little protein.

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Seeds are great--
all different kinds

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.040 align:middle line:84%
of seeds from pomegranate
seeds to pumpkin seeds

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.160 align:middle line:90%
to sunflower seeds.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just we have,
like God it's amazing.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.450 align:middle line:84%
If people like--
it's amazing what's

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:14.770 align:middle line:90%
going on in the food industry.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.600 align:middle line:84%
They're making food
taste so wonderful,

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:18.280 align:middle line:90%
great food taste so wonderful.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.092 align:middle line:84%
So people can't tell
me they can't go--

00:50:20.092 --> 00:50:21.550 align:middle line:84%
every year a couple
of times a year

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.680 align:middle line:84%
they have the natural
products expo.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely fabulous, how
we're reinventing food.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with Dr. Connealy.

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Food that's good for us
doesn't have to taste bad.

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:33.570 align:middle line:90%
It actually should taste good.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And in today's world, we have
a ton of choices of good foods

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:middle line:84%
that are actually healthy for
us, that taste good as well.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that Dr.
Connealy mentioned was seeds.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's go talk to Dr. Brad Weeks,
and find out the importance

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:48.580 align:middle line:90%
of seeds in our daily diet.

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.850 align:middle line:84%
What are the most important
foods, in your opinion,

00:50:51.850 --> 00:50:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that have medicinal
value that can help

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:57.280 align:middle line:90%
to prevent disease, cancer?

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing
there is to be well hydrated.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Good quality water.

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm against fluoride
in water, I'm

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:90%
against chlorine if possible.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately we have
an artesian well.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:12.490 align:middle line:10%
I like mineral
water, spring water.

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:16.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm not a big fan of the
alkaline water process,

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.660 align:middle line:10%
but certainly the body
has to be well hydrated.

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's important
about that--

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Ty, you may not know this,
but any addictive process,

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:29.320 align:middle line:84%
whether it's cocaine or heroin
or coffee or cigarettes,

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.599 align:middle line:84%
is tougher to break if
the person is dehydrated.

00:51:32.599 --> 00:51:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I
do with someone who's,

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:37.510 align:middle line:84%
for example an
addict, is I rehydrate

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:39.554 align:middle line:90%
and I stabilize blood sugar.

00:51:39.554 --> 00:51:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
about nicotine, for example,

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:46.100 align:middle line:84%
it clears the system quicker
if you're dehydrated.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So the patient is reaching
for another cigarette.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you're well
hydrated, they're

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.200 align:middle line:84%
not quite sure when the
nicotine left their system.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's the same thing--

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:58.420 align:middle line:84%
cancer, all the illnesses
we pay attention to

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.300 align:middle line:84%
are less problematic if the
person is well hydrated.

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And water is a tremendous
anti-inflammatory, of course.

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a fan of
anti-inflammatory diets.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:13.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm a fan of eating real
food, eating living food.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's astonishing
to me that we even have

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.040 align:middle line:90%
this category called junk food.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.052 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell my
patients, you know,

00:52:21.052 --> 00:52:22.510 align:middle line:84%
there's no such
thing as junk food.

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:23.759 align:middle line:90%
There's food and there's junk.

00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And even though the junk can
taste like food, it's not food.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:27.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's really
not going to do what

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:28.834 align:middle line:90%
food should do-- nourish you.

00:52:28.834 --> 00:52:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's kind of an oxymoron.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It is indeed.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So the thing which I paid a
lot of attention to recently

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:36.280 align:middle line:90%
is eating seeds.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to use that
term generally-- seeds would

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.910 align:middle line:90%
include nuts.

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:40.870 align:middle line:90%
It would include beans.

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:42.536 align:middle line:84%
Anything which you
can put in the ground

00:52:42.536 --> 00:52:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and it will grow-- a pea would
be a seed in that regard.

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Eggs, something like that.

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Caviar in particular-- fabulous.

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So seeds are
tremendously valuable,

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.870 align:middle line:84%
because the seed is such
a wise little packet.

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:59.590 align:middle line:84%
It concentrates nutrients
about 20-fold and 30-fold more

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:01.870 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of the fruit.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:06.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's this fabulous packet
of concentrated nutrition.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And what we know
is that it's got

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:13.420 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of genetic
spare parts--

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:84%
if it's not going to be a
seed that grows into a plant.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:20.170 align:middle line:84%
That's available for you and I
to repair our DNA and RNA with.

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It also has tremendous
stem cell precursors,

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.732 align:middle line:90%
especially in the husk of seeds.

00:53:24.732 --> 00:53:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>> After that information
from Dr. Weeks,

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.564 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to start
incorporating more seeds

00:53:28.564 --> 00:53:29.410 align:middle line:90%
into my diet.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the end of the
episode Nature's Pharmacy,

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:33.190 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to shift
gears a little bit.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:36.430 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard the phrase
laughter is the best medicine,

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:39.030 align:middle line:84%
so let's find out some
information about laughter

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and about music, and how these
things can impact our health.

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:44.664 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk to
Dr. Patrick Quillin,

00:53:44.664 --> 00:53:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
talk to Dr. Francisco

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Contreras about this
very important issue.

00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:51.160 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a role
does music have

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.250 align:middle line:84%
in the overall health
equation treating

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:56.380 align:middle line:90%
cancer, or other diseases?

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:01.540 align:middle line:10%
I started playing guitar at
age 17, and it was enjoyable.

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:02.340 align:middle line:10%
Fun.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.090 align:middle line:10%
It was a stress reliever.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:07.330 align:middle line:10%
An emotional life
raft, if you will.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I put it away when
my career got busy thinking,

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.647 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time
for this nonsense.

00:54:11.647 --> 00:54:13.480 align:middle line:84%
There's other things
that I should be doing,

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.175 align:middle line:90%
higher priority.

00:54:15.175 --> 00:54:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I found a
textbook from the New York

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Academy of Sciences
called "The Biological

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Foundations of Music."

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is a $100
textbook from all

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.790 align:middle line:84%
these academically
affiliated MDs and PhDs.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is they
show that when you play music--

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.940 align:middle line:84%
and actually you can show
things when you sing, too.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.595 align:middle line:90%
Music in general is therapeutic.

00:54:36.595 --> 00:54:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Singing and playing is
even more therapeutic.

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Just listening to music that
relaxes you is good for you,

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and it can have extraordinary
healing capacities.

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The studies are
beyond argument now,

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that the music that
you're listening to,

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:53.110 align:middle line:84%
making, singing,
or playing actually

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:55.320 align:middle line:90%
changes the way the brain works.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Han Selye, in his
incredible work--

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.812 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Selye was the
grandfather of stress.

00:54:59.812 --> 00:55:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's many others in
the field who have clearly

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:08.620 align:middle line:84%
proven that stress is a
killer, and music is a healer.

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:12.160 align:middle line:84%
In the same line
of thought, here's

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.250 align:middle line:84%
a quote by former
President John F Kennedy--

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.840 align:middle line:84%
"Humor is the
balancing stick that

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.042 align:middle line:84%
allows us to walk the
tightrope of life."

00:55:19.042 --> 00:55:20.250 align:middle line:90%
So you've talked about music.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Talk about humor.

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:25.370 align:middle line:84%
We were given this funny
bone for a good reason.

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that there's
many people who say,

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.410 align:middle line:90%
you think it's funny?

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:31.210 align:middle line:90%
This isn't funny.

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Look at my life.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell you
things about my life

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that you could easily get
very discouraged about.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet John Kennedy's
quote is absolutely true,

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that we're all walking
this tightrope of life.

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And that that humor is
the balancing stick that

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.890 align:middle line:90%
allows us to manage it well.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a
couple of examples.

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.350 align:middle line:84%
What do the following longevity
experts have in common?

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Bob Hope lived to be 100.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:58.420 align:middle line:90%
George Burns lived to be 99.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Art Linkletter lived to be 97.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Jack LaLanne lived
to be 95, I believe.

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Phyllis Diller, I believe
is in her early 90s.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Betty White, who's
still alive and doing

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.760 align:middle line:90%
great, in her early 90s.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.350 align:middle line:90%
What do they all have in common?

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> A great sense of humor.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happens is we're
all exposed to a certain amount

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:90%
of stress.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Some of us-- not
me, but some of us--

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:29.200 align:middle line:84%
God bless you
combat veterans who

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.390 align:middle line:84%
are returning with a
lot of stress, mentally

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:32.650 align:middle line:90%
and physically.

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:33.760 align:middle line:90%
More than I could handle.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.200 align:middle line:84%
But somehow we have to be able
to take that stress and use

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.820 align:middle line:84%
humor to try and
dissipate the stress.

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is here's
this big ugly balloon

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that's blocking our view
of the beauty of life.

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.670 align:middle line:90%
And humor says, pop the balloon.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Or at least slowly
let the air out of it.

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And a great metaphor
would be it's

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.580 align:middle line:84%
the shock absorbers
that allow us

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.730 align:middle line:84%
to ride that rocky,
bumpy back road of life.

00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And it says, I can tolerate
this because of humor.

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I can dissipate the
energy, because if you

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:09.580 align:middle line:84%
can get a sense of humor
about things-- and Bob Hope,

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.710 align:middle line:84%
of course, had so
many great lines.

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:14.980 align:middle line:84%
He traveled the world many
times with the troops.

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And how can you go
into a combat scene

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.520 align:middle line:84%
where people are
dying and suffering

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and afraid and depressed
and offer humor?

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.801 align:middle line:84%
Not only how can
you-- you have to.

00:57:23.801 --> 00:57:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things,
Dr. Contreras,

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned was
laughter and music.

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's so ironic,
the reason that I'm able

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:34.600 align:middle line:84%
to interview you today is
because of Dr. Patrick Quillin.

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.237 align:middle line:84%
He spoke to you
earlier today and said,

00:57:36.237 --> 00:57:37.570 align:middle line:90%
you should go interview with Ty.

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> He mentioned two important
facets of any cancer treatment

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.130 align:middle line:90%
are music and laughter.

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> They are the most potent
immune stimulating agents

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:46.510 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:48.382 align:middle line:10%
There's no drug,
there's no vaccine

00:57:48.382 --> 00:57:50.590 align:middle line:10%
that is more potent to
stimulating the immune system.

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:52.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a study, a
very interesting study,

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:56.380 align:middle line:84%
that shows that for
every minute of anger,

00:57:56.380 --> 00:58:00.160 align:middle line:84%
you will depress
significantly, and measurably

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.030 align:middle line:84%
of course, the quality and
quantity of your immune system.

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:07.790 align:middle line:84%
One minute of anger--
six hours of depression.

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:11.500 align:middle line:84%
One minute of laughter
will boost significantly

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.450 align:middle line:90%
your immune system for 24 hours.

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:17.980 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- children
up to the age of five

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.230 align:middle line:90%
laugh around 400 times a day.

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Adults only about 40.

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason why children
can eat dirt and be dirty

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:28.420 align:middle line:84%
all the time, it's
because they're laughing.

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Laughter is
the best medicine.

00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And so they're protected.

00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So at the Oasis of Hope, we have
laughter sessions every day.

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Every time we get
together with them,

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.120 align:middle line:84%
no matter how
serious the thing is,

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:44.156 align:middle line:84%
we try to put in
several jokes for them.

00:58:44.156 --> 00:58:45.280 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to be good.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.480 align:middle line:84%
We laugh-- sometimes we laugh
at the people telling the jokes.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes you laugh at
how bad the jokes were.

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:58:54.490 --> 00:59:00.060 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing how powerful
things that cost nothing are.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.160 align:middle line:90%
You know, meditation.

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:04.110 align:middle line:90%
Colors.

00:59:04.110 --> 00:59:05.880 align:middle line:84%
There are studies that
show that the most

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.490 align:middle line:84%
immune depressing colors
are white and blue.

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:11.340 align:middle line:84%
The typical hospital
colors- imagine that.

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So we painted all
our walls mauve,

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.580 align:middle line:84%
because there are studies
that show that it's

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:22.290 align:middle line:90%
the most immune lifting color.

00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So we take into account
all of those things.

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Those little things
sometimes count for a lot.

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Those little things do
sometimes account for a lot.

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:33.690 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree.

00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Music and laughter are
two things that are free.

00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:38.520 align:middle line:84%
They stimulate
the immune system,

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and they help us to be healthy.

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.180 align:middle line:84%
They are part of nature's
natural pharmacy.

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Laughter is the best medicine.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.810 align:middle line:90%
We can access them 24/7.

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:47.910 align:middle line:10%
I recommend that you do.

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.520 align:middle line:10%
In this next clip, Mike
Adams the Health Ranger,

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.280 align:middle line:10%
really summarizes
this entire episode

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.230 align:middle line:10%
as he elaborates on
the amazing pharmacy

00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:57.870 align:middle line:10%
that we have right
outside in nature.

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:00.900 align:middle line:10%
>> It reminds me of a question
a traditional Chinese medicine

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:04.680 align:middle line:10%
master once asked me when
we were having discussions

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.620 align:middle line:10%
in nature about what's healing?

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.620 align:middle line:10%
And he asked me this very
powerful but simple question.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:14.670 align:middle line:10%
We were in a forest, and
he said, look around.

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Find me something around
here in the forest,

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
find me something
that is not medicine.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:22.780 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't.

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You couldn't do it.

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I couldn't.

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Everything around
us was medicine

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:31.090 align:middle line:84%
in one form or another, even
the soil beneath our feet.

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:33.420 align:middle line:84%
The microbes in the
soil are medicine.

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
The minerals in the
stones are medicine.

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The chemical constituents
in the tree bark

01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:39.480 align:middle line:84%
are traditional
Chinese medicine.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.520 align:middle line:90%
A lot of those are tree barks.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The herbs, the
plants, everything

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:46.020 align:middle line:90%
had a medicinal component.

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Even the sky, the
sunlight, was medicinal.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.550 align:middle line:90%
The water in the plants--

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:52.620 align:middle line:90%
medicinal.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find anything
that wasn't medicine.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:56.765 align:middle line:84%
And so when people tell
me, when they come up to me

01:00:56.765 --> 01:00:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and they say things
like, I don't

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:01.740 align:middle line:84%
know what to do about cancer,
I've tried everything.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Have you tried nature?

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.920 align:middle line:90%
Have you?

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I bet you on the way
to your cancer clinic,

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.090 align:middle line:90%
you walked by nature.

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.290 align:middle line:84%
You walked by some
plants that probably have

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:12.780 align:middle line:90%
anti-cancer medicines in them.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I guarantee they did.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I used to live in
the desert in Arizona.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And there were anti-cancer
treatment centers there

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
where the very parking lots
had anti-cancer plants.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Very potent.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And they probably were better
treatments than were inside.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So people would park their
cars, ignoring the medicine

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:32.070 align:middle line:90%
right there for free.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:35.245 align:middle line:84%
>> And they would walk inside
the cancer treatment center

01:01:35.245 --> 01:01:37.440 align:middle line:84%
and get poisoned,
and pay for it.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And wonder why they
were still sick.

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:42.156 align:middle line:84%
That's how messed up the
cancer industry is today.

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:44.440 align:middle line:90%


01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.531 align:middle line:84%
That's some amazing information
that we learned tonight

01:01:47.531 --> 01:01:48.779 align:middle line:90%
about nature's pharmacy.

01:01:48.779 --> 01:01:50.070 align:middle line:90%
You know, food is so important.

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:52.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't understand
the importance of food,

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.012 align:middle line:84%
of nutrition, of your diet
in preventing disease.

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Now that's something
that I didn't really

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
understand as much as I
do now several years ago.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.410 align:middle line:90%
I've learned over the years.

01:02:01.410 --> 01:02:02.964 align:middle line:90%
We're all continually learning.

01:02:02.964 --> 01:02:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you learned a
lot from tonight's episode.

01:02:05.130 --> 01:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
really fond memories

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to have of this
time of my life, this period,

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
is I've got four kids
and a beautiful wife,

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and we cook together
on a daily basis.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.430 align:middle line:90%
And we cook clean foods.

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I say clean
foods, I don't mean foods

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.181 align:middle line:90%
that you necessarily wash well.

01:02:18.181 --> 01:02:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Which you should wash
them, but I mean foods

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that are healthy for our
body that give us life.

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:23.790 align:middle line:90%
We do this all the time.

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Even my little four-year-old,
Charity, she gets up with me

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:27.630 align:middle line:90%
and she helps me make foods.

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:29.999 align:middle line:84%
Tabitha, my 8-year-old,
she helps me cook.

01:02:29.999 --> 01:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course, Briana and
Bryce, they're older.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:32.620 align:middle line:90%
They help cook.

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we all do.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a family affair in the
kitchen, and we love it.

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:39.349 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can't stop at one episode
with the importance of food.

01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:41.640 align:middle line:84%
We talked about some food
and some of nature's pharmacy

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
tonight, and we're going to talk
about it again tomorrow night.

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
You're going to really
learn more about nutrition.

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It was such an important topic,
we had to do two episodes.

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:50.129 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
teach you tomorrow

01:02:50.129 --> 01:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
night how to eat foods
that give you life,

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and that can give your
body what it needs

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.636 align:middle line:90%
so that you can stay healthy.

01:02:56.636 --> 01:02:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you
tuned in tonight,

01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and I hope we'll see
you tomorrow night.

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
God bless.

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:03.611 align:middle line:90%

01:03:03.611 --> 01:03:12.774 align:middle line:90%


01:03:12.774 --> 01:03:13.940 align:middle line:90%
So I'm here with the Elaine.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:17.080 align:middle line:10%
And Elaine was diagnosed
with cancer a few years ago.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:19.697 align:middle line:10%
So I want to get you
tell us about the cancer,

01:03:19.697 --> 01:03:21.030 align:middle line:10%
and what did you do to treat it?

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.350 align:middle line:10%
And what are you up to today?

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:23.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure.

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Ty.

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:29.250 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed in
2008, February 2008,

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.750 align:middle line:90%
with a recurrence--

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
a surprise recurrence-- after
being clean for six years

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
with stage 4
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Just covered with disease
from here to here.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And my oncologist insisted
that I do a judicial protocol,

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and I just knew in my
heart it wasn't for me.

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So we parted ways,
and I actually

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
went down to Mexico to do some
treatments, but then came back.

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:01.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was in big trouble.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.400 align:middle line:90%
I was in really big trouble.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So I found a facility near
me in the Washington DC

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
area that did some
nontraditional integrative

01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.120 align:middle line:90%
protocols.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And in about 18 months, I was
told that I was in remission

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:19.590 align:middle line:90%
and I was disease free.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But it had come
back once, and I was

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
very reticent to be
excited because it probably

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:28.870 align:middle line:90%
would have come back again.

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was I went
on a journey, after I fell

01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:36.420 align:middle line:84%
to my knees and I looked
up and I said, God,

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.860 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm not going to die.

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me what
you want me to learn.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.000 align:middle line:90%
So I went on a learning journey.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And I put a lot of
the pieces together.

01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I found there was no one place
that had all the information

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:50.280 align:middle line:90%
or practicals.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So I went on a journey,
and what I learned

01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
was that we have to take
care of the immune system.

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:59.190 align:middle line:84%
We have to get
our pH in balance.

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have to get into this
alkaline oxygen rich lifestyle.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And once I learned that, my
body just responded incredibly.

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I have become a
green juice-aholic.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm totally addicted
to green juice--

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.670 align:middle line:84%
real green juice,
because I don't

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:19.770 align:middle line:90%
do fruit because of the sugar.

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:21.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm very high alkaline.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I do now is I have
totally changed my direction,

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.940 align:middle line:90%
and I help people understand.

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:34.260 align:middle line:10%
And in January 2012 I
started what we lovingly

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:40.200 align:middle line:10%
call Renewed Living, Inc. And we
make extraordinary health easy.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.750 align:middle line:10%
And I teach a very
practical way to implement

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:46.110 align:middle line:10%
what real health looks like.

01:05:46.110 --> 01:05:49.260 align:middle line:10%
So I encourage
anybody who is looking

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.650 align:middle line:10%
at this to get a
good strong basis,

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:56.580 align:middle line:10%
and just ask yourself every
day, how can I stay alkaline

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.400 align:middle line:10%
and how can I get
oxygen into my body?

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
always in the question.

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And with that, you will always
look and feel extraordinary.

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:07.937 align:middle line:84%
Very, very encouraging
story, Elaine.

01:06:07.937 --> 01:06:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
sharing with us today.

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:11.395 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for all
the work that you do.
