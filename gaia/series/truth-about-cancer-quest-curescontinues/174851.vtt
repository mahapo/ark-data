00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:17.632 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back, everyone,
to the Quest for the Cures

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.810 align:middle line:90%
continues.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the 11th and final
episode of this docuseries.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
tuning in these last 10 days,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and we've saved the best
for last because tonight,

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:84%
we're going to learn the exact
protocols that several cancer

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.629 align:middle line:84%
patients have used to treat
their cancer naturally.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I say they treat
their cancer naturally,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.440 align:middle line:84%
what they've really done is
they've provided their body

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.900 align:middle line:84%
with what it needs so that
it functions properly so

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:90%
that that immune system works.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And when the immune
system is working,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
we know that cancer
is not an issue.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You're going to really
enjoy this show,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to really
benefit from this show,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
you're going to learn
information that is vital,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and it might save your life
or the life of a loved one,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:84%
so grab a pen and paper
and enjoy the show.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.297 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you afterwards.

00:00:56.297 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.040 align:middle line:10%
I am sitting here tonight in
Motown, Detroit, Michigan,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:10%
and I'm sitting with
a good friend of mine.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.519 align:middle line:84%
I've known Kevin Irish
for several years now,

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.310 align:middle line:84%
and I'm honored to be
able to interview you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
tonight, Kevin.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being with us.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Ty.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:90%
It's my pleasure to be here.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going
to get your story.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get your story
tonight of being diagnosed

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.031 align:middle line:84%
with cancer, and the
treatments that you've used,

00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:84%
but first of all,
just tell everyone

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.707 align:middle line:84%
that's watching here a
little bit about yourself.

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Where'd you grow up?

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:90%
What did you do?

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:90%
What do you do now?

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about Kevin Irish.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Up to about 5
and 1/2 years ago,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:10%
I was a senior design engineer
for the automotive business.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:10%
I designed a lot of car parts
and did a lot of analyzing

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like that.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.277 align:middle line:84%
I'm also an artist and
I'm a published author.

00:01:52.277 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic artist, by the way.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:90%
I've seen a lot of your artwork.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But ever since right
up until my diagnosis,

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I had a pretty much normal
life just doing my thing

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and working and
going about my life.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.139 align:middle line:84%
And that all changed
on January, 24, 2009.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I had noticed I had a
little back pain in 2008,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and I had just
taken up golf, and I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:90%
figured I just overdid it.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.995 align:middle line:84%
Now is in very good
shape prior to all this

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
until I noticed my left
eyelid started to droop.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:90%
That caused me concern.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I went and saw my doctor
on the 24th of January,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and the first thing he said is,
Kev, that's Horner's Syndrome.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.827 align:middle line:84%
He said that's a sign
of advanced lung cancer.

00:02:33.827 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I first
heard my name and the word

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.366 align:middle line:84%
cancer, advanced lung
cancer, in the same sentence.

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you a
smoker before that?

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I was, about a
pack and a half a day,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:90%
and so it's self-inflicted.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want any pity, but
nonetheless, we're human.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
It was the only vise I
had, so now it's gone.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
But the terror and the
fear were immediate,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
and, yeah, I broke
down in tears.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And my doctor had ordered CAT
scans that were ordered stat.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.271 align:middle line:84%
He said, you're going to
go right to the hospital

00:03:03.271 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:90%
and have this done.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say,
I was terrified,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and I cried the
whole time there.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So later that evening about
9 o'clock at night, my doctor

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
had called me at home,
and he said, Kev, he says,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:90%
it's stage 4 inoperable.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And I collapsed on my
kitchen floor and I cried.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:84%
But I got my composure
back real quick,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.887 align:middle line:90%
and I said, well, what do I do?

00:03:24.887 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, Kev, we're
going to try and get you

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.762 align:middle line:90%
as much time as possible.

00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:29.511 align:middle line:84%
He said, tomorrow
morning you're scheduled

00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:30.712 align:middle line:90%
to go in for a biopsy.

00:03:30.712 --> 00:03:33.170 align:middle line:84%
He said just be there and they
will take you the minute you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.110 align:middle line:90%
go in, and that's what I did.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.764 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's five years ago,
stage 4 inoperable lung cancer.

00:03:40.764 --> 00:03:42.305 align:middle line:84%
What was the prognosis
at that point?

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.250 align:middle line:90%
What was the prognosis for--

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:90%
you're five years out now.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Over five years.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, over five years, so
what was the prognosis for you

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
lasting five years
from that point?

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.492 align:middle line:84%
>> The prognosis
from my research,

00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
because the first thing I did
was I wanted to research what

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:84%
was going on, and I looked at
one of the popular websites

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
that people go to you
for medical advice,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and I saw the
identical diagnosis.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's important
that people know

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.691 align:middle line:84%
that each diagnosis
might be the same,

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
but it's different
on every patient.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Because every
patient is unique.

00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and so was
their treatment plan.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.289 align:middle line:84%
But this website had said I
had a 5% chance of making it

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:90%
five years.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>> 5%.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>> So much for that.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You're alive and
kicking five years later,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.723 align:middle line:90%
and you're really healthy.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, you're in good shape.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.375 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been working at it.

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's been a very, very
long, long hard road,

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and I was single at the time,
and I did it all by myself.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you do?

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
What was the treatment
recommendations

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:90%
by your oncologist?

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
I assume you went to a
traditional oncologist?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my doctor, who I've
known for many years prior

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:84%
to that, he took the ball,
and he made calls to radiology

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.919 align:middle line:84%
oncology to chemotherapy
and to the thoracic surgeon,

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
he even called about
getting me health insurance,

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.120 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't have any.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So I was afraid I was
going to die because I

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:90%
couldn't afford the treatments.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.540 align:middle line:90%
He said don't worry about it.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know anything
about alternative treatments.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I just was in shock, and
I didn't want to die.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So within just a few days,
I did have the biopsy,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and it came back stage 3A,
non-small cell carcinoma,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.600 align:middle line:90%
which is the good news.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Now when you have cancer,
how can it be good news?

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, non-small cell cancer
moves very, very slowly.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Slower growing.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I was told was
is that the tumor I had I had

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
for approximately two
years, and it was massive.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.029 align:middle line:84%
It was 5 and 1/2 centimeters
by 4 centimeters,

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and it was lying on
the outside of my lung.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
It was called a Pancoast tumor,
and it was growing in directly

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.220 align:middle line:84%
into my spinal column, which
is right next to my heart,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:90%
and it was just wreaking havoc.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:10%
So stage 3A lung
cancer is bad enough,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:10%
the treatments, because I've
lost relatives to cancer,

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:10%
I know what they
went through, and I

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:10%
saw what they went through.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:10%
So of course, I was terrified.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.650 align:middle line:84%
The following Monday,
I went in and I

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.582 align:middle line:84%
had a surgical port
put into my chest

00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
because I was going
to be receiving

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
massive amounts of
chemo, and I was going

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:90%
to be getting double dosed.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I would have a 6 and 1/2 hour
infusion five days a week

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
followed by 15 minute
session with the radiation.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:90%
That was murder.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.720 align:middle line:84%
That was the most terrifying
thing in the world

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
to be sitting in a room having
this poison pumped into me,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel it from
the very first infusion.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And within two or three
days, I started losing hair,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and I was losing
weight like crazy.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't eat.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Just the whole myriad
of the horror stories

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.610 align:middle line:84%
you hear about
chemo, they're true.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You had chemical poisoning.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Big time.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And it was the worst thing ever.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I honestly wouldn't wish
this on my worst enemy.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you how bad it was.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.820 align:middle line:84%
There were-- all
through it, because I

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:84%
know the stories of chemo,
the majority of cancer deaths

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:84%
isn't from cancer
killing patients.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.035 align:middle line:90%
It's the chemo.

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I would go to bed
at night, and I

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:84%
didn't know if I was going
to wake up in the morning.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Post-operative chemo lasted
for another three months,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and in that time, I
started investigating

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
alternative treatments,
and I was blown away.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely blown away
that natural substances

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
that come out of our planet
can cure and prevent cancer.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.009 align:middle line:84%
That's when I started
really going nuts.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you went nuts, and
you learned about these natural

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
treatments, which ones caught
your eye and which ones did you

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.744 align:middle line:84%
eventually implement in
your own treatment protocol?

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, I
have implemented several,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.120 align:middle line:84%
and these are all prevention
because I am cancer free,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.717 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to keep that way.

00:07:29.717 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to keep anyone
that I talk to cancer free,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.841 align:middle line:84%
and I've talked to a
lot of cancer patients

00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
survivors since then.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The first one that I came
across with vitamin B-17, which

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.740 align:middle line:84%
was known as Laetrile back
in the late 60s and 70s,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and then it disappeared for some
political reason, we'll say,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
but it was a derivative
from apricot pits.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the most natural
thing you can think of,

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:84%
but an apricot pit
that cures cancer?

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And helps maintain and
regulate blood pressure,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.839 align:middle line:84%
and it has a natural
pain reliever in it?

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:00.685 align:middle line:90%
I'm down with that.

00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
My dad at 95-years-old, he
had three nasty skin tumors

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:90%
on his back.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
My doctor identified
them as basal carcinoma.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
His treating doctor
had an ointment

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
put on there, which
made the tumors bleed.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
She said stop using it for
a week and try it again.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Soon as he did, they
started bleeding.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Then she put him on
a purified Vaseline,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
which has absolutely
no medicinal use

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
except for keeping
the tumors moist.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I said, Dad, that's nonsense.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
So I got him B-17
100 milligram tabs.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I got him 2000 IUs D3, and
I put him on that regimen.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.696 align:middle line:84%
And in six weeks, I
looked at his back,

00:08:40.696 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and instead of putting
the ointment on there,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I took pictures because there
was nice, pink healthy scar

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:84%
tissue where each one
of his tumors was.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And what got me so big on the D3
was the following year, January

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
of 2010, following treatment,
I needed to get out of town.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So I visited my best friend out
in Arizona to do some golfing.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.844 align:middle line:84%
Before I left, I
saw it on the news.

00:09:02.844 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It was here in
southeast Michigan.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what hospital it
was, but in a hospital setting,

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:84%
a woman had stage
3 breast cancer.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
She was being treated with
massive doses of vitamin

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:90%
D3 in a hospital setting.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Her tumors reduced by 50%
in 10 days and no harm

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of her body.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:90%
I was sold.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And further research found
even more amazing news

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
regarding cannabis
and CBD, cannabidiol.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman who had
stage 3B cancer, lung cancer,

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.640 align:middle line:84%
a little bit worse than
mine, and it's documented.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.470 align:middle line:84%
She was out of San
Francisco General,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and her oncologist has
been there for 25 years.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall his
name, but the crux of it

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.590 align:middle line:84%
was she was facing
to lobectomies.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Three super enlarged
lymph nodes.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.710 align:middle line:84%
She was cancer ridden,
and this is the fun part.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
She was taking CBD
oil, just little

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.769 align:middle line:84%
tiny amounts in a
capsule every day

00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:90%
for the first 3 and 1/2 months.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Same protocol I went under,
the chemo and the radiation.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:84%
At the end of it,
they did the CT scan

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:90%
to see if surgery was viable.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.361 align:middle line:84%
Here's where it gets
real fun, the surgeons

00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:84%
called her up and said
we need to come in.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.960 align:middle line:90%
You need to have the surgery.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on in there.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:90%
We need to find out what it is.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:84%
They opened her
up, and they found

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:84%
that the cancer on one
lung was just scar tissue.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:90%
They left that lung alone.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
The three super enlarged
lymph nodes were necrotic.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:90%
They were dead.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
They were eating themselves,
and all the tissue around them

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:90%
was healthy.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:90%
Here's the fun part.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
The main tumor on her other
lung, it was necrotic.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.430 align:middle line:90%
It was eating itself to nothing.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
They took out about a little
larger than a golf ball

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:84%
size out of her lung, and
they removed those three lymph

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.694 align:middle line:84%
nodes, and that's all they
did to her, and she's fine.

00:10:47.694 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They interviewed her doctor
immediately after there,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.120 align:middle line:90%
and he said, this is amazing.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.539 align:middle line:84%
He had other patients going
through the same treatment.

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:90%
They didn't have those results.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the only
difference was the CBD oil?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The only variable
was the CBD oil.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.960 align:middle line:84%
This stuff has been proven to
not only cure cancer, but also

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
eliminate epileptic
seizures by 99%.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:90%
It's written down.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.240 align:middle line:90%
It's documented.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Two years ago, the front page of
our Detroit News, the youngest

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Michigan medical marijuana
patient was epileptic.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:90%
He was taking CBD oil.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.917 align:middle line:84%
His seizures were reduced by
99% in severity and frequency.

00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:24.000 align:middle line:10%
Another case of a little
5-year-old girl, and this

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:10%
is what really breaks
a person's heart,

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:10%
she had over 300 seizures a day.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.537 align:middle line:90%
They were terrible.

00:11:29.537 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:90%
She was always wearing headgear.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:31.703 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't go out.

00:11:31.703 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
She was always bruised, and she
was always doped up to the max.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Her parents are tired of that.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.650 align:middle line:90%
They went to Colorado.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:90%
They got CBD oil for her.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Within the first few days
her symptoms were gone.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.542 align:middle line:84%
She'd had maybe one or
two seizures a week,

00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and she could go-- a year
later they did a follow up,

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
she was outside
playing, laughing,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:84%
she didn't wear the
headgear, didn't

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:90%
have to take all this stuff.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
She was a normal
little 6-year-old girl,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and it made you cry to see that
a simple little extract could

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:90%
give this girl her life back.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me-- kind of
summarize your protocol.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So you went through a
couple of rounds of chemo,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:84%
you talked about how they made
you feel like you're going

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:90%
to die from the treatment.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>> But so tell me what kind of--

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:84%
itemize your treatment protocol
that you used once you said,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing these
toxic treatments anymore.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go back to nature.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
What did that treatment protocol
look like to you personally?

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, that meant getting
away from anything that has

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:84%
additives, preservatives,
anything that's artificial.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I went back to more natural
food, more homegrown

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:90%
food, nothing with GMOs.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And I had to start getting
myself back together.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge physical
and psychological damage

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that happens from having
advanced stage cancer,

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't going to sit
there in a chair and veg,

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.750 align:middle line:90%
and say, woe is me.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Cancer retired
me, but that's OK.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm above ground,
and I'm still here.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.372 align:middle line:90%
And now it's my mission.

00:12:55.372 --> 00:12:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I've always liked to be
a little helper monkey.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I like to do snow
blowing for my seniors

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and just help people out, but
now I've got a bigger mission.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:90%
I beat cancer.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I beat late stage
cancer, so that means

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.270 align:middle line:90%
other people can beat it too.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>> You've written a book.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.550 align:middle line:84%
I want you to talk
about it briefly.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> This is my book.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.470 align:middle line:84%
"I'm Still Here, A
Cancer Survivor Story."

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.340 align:middle line:84%
It's available on Barnes
Noble, amazon.com,

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.400 align:middle line:84%
and a whole other
online book resellers.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And $5 for every
book sold online

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
goes into my charity, which
is called Kev's Cause.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And last year, I was
able to raise $900

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and I gave this money
to my oncologist,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:84%
who gave it to patients who
were having financial problems.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:84%
But the book was basically
what my cancer was.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.900 align:middle line:90%
It was the story you just heard.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.350 align:middle line:90%
How I got through it.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Some of the cruel things that
happen to people afterwards.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But again, living a better life
is the best revenge, you know?

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Cancer got me.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:90%
It almost killed me.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.070 align:middle line:84%
My revenge against cancer
is living a better life,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and help other people
do the same thing,

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:90%
and that's my reward.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:90%
That's where I get my kicks.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Final question.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:84%
If you had one thing to
tell cancer patients, one

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
word of encouragement, one
word of advice to them,

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.320 align:middle line:90%
what would it be?

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got a
big audience right now.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:middle line:84%
We've got tens of
thousands, potentially

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands,
of people watching.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing I would
tell them is never give up.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Don't ever quit, and
remember the cancer

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to be
a death sentence.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm living proof.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me what
happened in 2005.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2005, I found a
lump under my left breast,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:10%
and it scared me.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.545 align:middle line:10%
You know, we're told to
do breast exams while we

00:14:33.545 --> 00:14:36.890 align:middle line:10%
were in the shower, and I felt
it, and I went to the doctors.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And when I was seen
in the examining room,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor
felt for the lump,

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:84%
he said, well, you
have cystic breasts.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but
this is different.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:84%
This one is getting a little
bit bigger, and it's harder.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you
know, I think your concern

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.642 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit too much.

00:14:58.642 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to be
worrying about this.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's probably caffeine.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You just need to cut
back on caffeine.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I only have
a cup a day of coffee.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I said, can we just biopsy it
and test it and see what it is

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:09.890 align:middle line:90%
or something?

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.070 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, you
have cystic breasts.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to biopsy
both breasts, and you'd

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:90%
look like Swiss cheese.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do it.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So I left feeling
really embarrassed.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Almost exactly a
year later, it was

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the size of like I
said a Martini olive,

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:90%
and I went in and waited.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:33.050 align:middle line:84%
They did biopsy it,
and I got the news.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.579 align:middle line:84%
And I got the phone
call, and they

00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:90%
said to bring a support person.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to
come in and to have

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
me talk to the doctor
personally face to face.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.430 align:middle line:84%
They said to bring someone
with me for support,

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and I just knew, and
it was a long drive.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So when I got there, there
was no one in the office

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.869 align:middle line:84%
except a nurse and
a doctor, and I knew

00:15:56.869 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:90%
that there was something wrong.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:90%
He handed me a bottle of water.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It had a pink label
on it, a ribbon.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And I could already start
feeling the blood leaving,

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:90%
draining to my feet.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't feel good, and
they told me it was cancer.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.060 align:middle line:84%
I had breast cancer,
and they immediately

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:90%
sent me to another doctor.

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:90%
And it was dark.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.884 align:middle line:84%
It was nighttime, and
I didn't understand.

00:16:20.884 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, can I
make an appointment?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
They said, no, we
called him for you.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:90%
He's waiting for you.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So in that aspect, I really
appreciated the urgency

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:84%
of rushing and getting
me to the next doctor.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Went there, and he
said, you're going

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to have to go and
get a lumpectomy,

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and pretty much this
is when everything

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:90%
started to change in my life.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So they wanted three types of
chemotherapy, two intravenous

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:90%
through a port, one by mouth.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It was an estrogen
positive cancer,

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and bilateral mastectomy
and radiation.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And I needed to hurry.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.980 align:middle line:90%
There was a sense of urgency.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:84%
So my sister was with me
and my boyfriend at the time

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:90%
was with me.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:84%
So I went ahead
with the mastectomy,

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and I had remembered what
my grandmother looked

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
like when she was
doing chemotherapy,

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:90%
and she lost a lot of weight.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was terrified,
and I just didn't

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
want to go through what she went
through losing all that weight

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:90%
and dying eventually.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.977 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like they just
threw almost everything,

00:17:31.977 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:84%
including the kitchen sink,
at you as far as recommended

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:90%
treatments.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>> They did.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a hospital where
I saw patients in the waiting

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.522 align:middle line:84%
room and they were missing
hair, they were wearing scarves.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They looked like they were
from a concentration camp.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.830 align:middle line:90%
It was terrifying.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned that they gave
you a bottle of water with pink

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.824 align:middle line:84%
Was it during breast
cancer awareness month?

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Was it during October?

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it was absolutely
during October, breast cancer

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
awareness month, and they
gave me-- everything was pink.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:90%
The pamphlets were pink.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The wig book was
pink, so I could

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.300 align:middle line:84%
start looking at
wigs ahead of time,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:90%
preparing me to lose my hair.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Even the scarves, if
I didn't want wigs,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
it was all these
information packets.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.880 align:middle line:84%
They gave me a bag
with a bunch of stuff

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:84%
in it, support groups,
pamphlets, everything.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.439 align:middle line:84%
So when I got through
with the mastectomy,

00:18:29.439 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
that's when they
were able to tell me

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
by taking the lymph
nodes out that it

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
had gotten into my lymph
nodes, and it was stage 3.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So they needed me
to do everything,

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and they needed
me to do it fast.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got staph
infection from the surgery,

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and this bought
me time, and this

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.690 align:middle line:90%
is when I started researching.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I did go through
with the mastectomy.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.670 align:middle line:84%
I had my family saying
just do it, just do it,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and that part I regret, and
I've got my own reason why.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
something that's

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
been scientifically researched,
it's just my own common sense.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Shannonite common sense,
but I got cancer again.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
I never got that
vitamin D checked out,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:90%
and I never got to address it.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you've got that
vitamin D deficiency,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:90%
you're still at risk.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So I feel if I had left
that mastectomy out

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and hadn't done it, that
cancer would have had a harder

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
time getting to my ribs
and getting to my lungs,

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and I could have just
had a better chance.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Plus the scar tissue,
they're finding

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.210 align:middle line:84%
research that says scar
tissue can cause cancer.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I read that
in January of 2014.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:84%
So If I had to do
it all over again,

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
done that surgery.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you talked about getting
to your ribs and your lungs.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.813 align:middle line:84%
So are you saying that
eventually the cancer

00:20:02.813 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:90%
spread to other organs?

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Talk about that.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I went through that nightmare
of getting diagnosed with it

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.050 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a recurrence in
July, same month, of 2010.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
It had spread into my
lungs and my lymph nodes.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
We have other lymph
nodes around this area,

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
so it was underneath my collar
bone, in the bone, my ribs,

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:32.500 align:middle line:84%
behind my trachea, and the
doctor told my family--

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
we were all sitting
in infusion chairs.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.050 align:middle line:90%
We had an early appointment.

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
My best friend flew out,
and we had two appointments.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I had to meet with a
radiation oncologist,

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and with my regular doctor.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:45.820 align:middle line:90%
He was wonderful.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Very kind through everything.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.870 align:middle line:10%
Told me, when asked, how
long does she have to live,

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:10%
everyone was concerned.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.971 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well, if
she does treatment,

00:20:57.971 --> 00:20:59.470 align:middle line:10%
you know, maybe a
little bit longer,

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle line:10%
but if she doesn't, you
know, three months, a year.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.817 align:middle line:90%
It's an aggressive cancer.

00:21:06.817 --> 00:21:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was not an encouraging
prognosis at that point?

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it was terrifying.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted me
to start treatment.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
He was encouraging me to be
sensible this time around.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Be sensible.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:90%
>> What exactly does that mean?

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.960 align:middle line:84%
What did that mean
according to him?

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.450 align:middle line:90%
What was being sensible?

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Being sensible-- the
first time when we met,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
he said that getting vitamin
C and doing these other things

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.732 align:middle line:84%
was like going to his words
exactly the sunshine farm,

00:21:34.732 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:90%
he laughed.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.480 align:middle line:90%
He laughed.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
I understand that
they're not learning

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:84%
about this in medical
school, so it probably

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.040 align:middle line:90%
is pretty funny to them.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But I told him I didn't
even want the tamoxifen,

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still not on it,
and I've been in remission

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.020 align:middle line:90%
2 and 1/2 years.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
So I allowed
radiation on one area

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.970 align:middle line:84%
because he did say that
this was so aggressive it

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:90%
was going to paralyze me.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's try to shrink this,
because that's not a good thing

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:90%
to happen either.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's try to shrink this.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I made it through 22 rounds,
and I couldn't complete it.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I ended up with staph
infection, pneumonia.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So it got worse, my
cancer got worse,

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.980 align:middle line:84%
and after we quit the
radiation, it was really sad.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.389 align:middle line:84%
That's when he said,
you know, unless I

00:22:32.389 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
do one of the treatments
he's recommending,

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing else he
can do, and it's spreading.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the beach
that day, and that's

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
when Angels for Shannon
came into my mind.

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to live.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:90%
I wanted other patients.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to do the
healthier treatments,

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.520 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted other patients
to have that opportunity.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I prayed to God to
let me live, and let

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:90%
me beat this the natural way.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Shannon, tell us about
the natural treatments that you

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:90%
pursued.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a list.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to let you
know what they were.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It was high dose
vitamin C intravenous.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
It was Laetrile, intravenous.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:90%
It was ozone therapy.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:90%
It was dendritic cell therapy.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:84%
It was dendritic
cell cancer vaccine

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.690 align:middle line:90%
made with your own blood.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It was hypothermia.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:90%
It was hyperbaric chamber.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It was treatments that are going
to boost your immune system,

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:90%
the thymus gland.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:90%
Magnetic therapy.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Biofeedback.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:90%
We've all heard of rife.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
There's Essiac, which I did
with my friend Cindy Jones.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Quantum physics is big.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.140 align:middle line:84%
We all need to be
taking a look at that.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.290 align:middle line:84%
We have energy within our
body, and we can't ignore that,

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:90%
and we need to balance that too.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's a compilation of things,
and it was a very comprehensive

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:90%
treatment program that I did.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.540 align:middle line:84%
I got my treatment
in February of 2011,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was symptom free--
you know when it's at--

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:84%
it had infiltrated
my air passages,

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:90%
and that's like a knife.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So I was symptom free
in August, late August,

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:84%
and I got it confirmed
with a PET scan in October.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.110 align:middle line:90%
So I can say it took six months.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:90%
I know when my body's healthy.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What did your oncologist
say when he saw the new scans,

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.580 align:middle line:90%
the new results?

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>> He was very happy, and he
asked my permission to have

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:84%
my medical records to take
to show to his colleagues.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I
said, yeah, take them.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:90%
He was very happy.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, I wish I had done
some treatment on you,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
so I could take the credit,
but he was being silly.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.977 align:middle line:90%
He's a good man.

00:24:48.977 --> 00:24:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds like a good man.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:90%
I like him.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.318 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to show him when
I'm in three years remission,

00:24:54.318 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:90%
so I can walk in there.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Give him a hug.

00:24:57.431 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you mentioned stage 4,
did the cancer eventually was

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.500 align:middle line:90%
stage 4?

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Stage 4.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It was scary.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.190 align:middle line:84%
My family was preparing
for me to die.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
My kids were crying,
calling me scared.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Not my son.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
He's a tough paramedic,
but my daughter was.

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> She's not crying anymore.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And both my kids
definitely believe now,

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
which makes me feel
good because I want them

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:90%
to know there is another way.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:90%
This is not a time to be afraid.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.681 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid of
cancer anymore.

00:25:31.681 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm really happy today to be
here in front of the Hollywood

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.310 align:middle line:10%
Hills out here in the
background with Kev Murray.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.562 align:middle line:10%
Kev is a cancer survivor,
and today, we're

00:25:47.562 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:10%
going to get his story.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:10%
So, Kev, thank you for
being with us here today.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.368 align:middle line:10%
>> Pleasure to be here.

00:25:51.368 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:10%
>> So let me start with this.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:10%
Eight years ago,
you were in college

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:10%
in San Antonio, Texas,
real close to where I live,

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.570 align:middle line:10%
and so take it away from there.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling kind
of odd, something's

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:84%
going on in your body, and
what happened eight years?

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:10%
I knew something was going on.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:10%
The symptoms were pretty
obvious, because I had a--

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:16.024 align:middle line:10%
you know, the tumor
was about that big.

00:26:16.024 --> 00:26:18.500 align:middle line:10%
Maybe a little less than
that, about that big, and it

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.350 align:middle line:10%
was testicular cancer.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So as you can imagine, the
signs were pretty obvious.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
what to expect.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I was in-- you could say
I was in denial about it.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.960 align:middle line:90%
I never expected cancer.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.332 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, you were
in college at the time.

00:26:33.332 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:90%
You were in in college.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.560 align:middle line:90%
How old were you?

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I was 22.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.620 align:middle line:10%
>> You were 22, so you don't
expect testicular cancer at 22.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:45.090 align:middle line:10%
All right, so you've got tumors,
testicular cancer, so what

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:10%
happened from St. Mary's
there in San Antonio?

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I quickly
went into surgery.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Within a few days, I
had the tumor removed.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:59.130 align:middle line:10%
And it was diagnosed as terminal
testicular cancer, which

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:10%
means it had metastasized.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:10%
I had three tumors
in my abdomen.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to split
me open from chest

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:10%
to navel, remove any infected
lymph nodes, and also douse me,

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, with
chemo and radiation.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.397 align:middle line:84%
And they said that would
be successful treatment.

00:27:21.397 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But you said that it
was diagnosed as terminal,

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.240 align:middle line:84%
which means they said, you
don't do any treatment,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:84%
they give you how many
months, years to live?

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:10%
They gave me six months to live.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Which is a pretty big slap
in the face when you're 22.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's ultimately
a death sentence.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:45.130 align:middle line:10%
I found out secondhand
years later,

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:49.499 align:middle line:10%
about three years after, that
they gave me that six months.

00:27:49.499 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>> But you didn't
know at that point?

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.892 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't know at that time.

00:27:52.892 --> 00:27:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So then they wanted
to douse you with chemo,

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.849 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to do radiation,
they'd removed some

00:27:56.849 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:90%
of the tumors with surgery.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So what protocol did
you use at that point?

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
You're 22 years old, diagnosed
with terminal testicular

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, immediately, I flew
back to South Carolina

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:12.790 align:middle line:84%
where my mother lives, and got
involved with the hospitals

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I had the scan card for
chemo and everything.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I was totally lined up to do it.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:10%
And I just I believe
I had a dream,

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:10%
or I think it was really
a vision of an angel,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:10%
and she just told me everything
was going to be fine.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.020 align:middle line:10%
But I felt totally against chemo
and radiation, so what I did,

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.200 align:middle line:10%
I went with the
Gerson therapy, which

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:10%
is based out of San Diego,
the Institute, the Gerson

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:10%
Institute.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.447 align:middle line:10%


00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:10%
>> What are the particulars
of the Gerson therapy?

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:10%
The protocol that you used?

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.290 align:middle line:10%
As opposed to chemo or
radiation, you chose Gerson.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:50.010 align:middle line:90%
What other?

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the particulars
of the Gerson therapy?

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's 12 to 13 juices
a day, one every hour.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:10%
>> So you're talking about
not juice off the shelves,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:10%
but you actually juice
vegetables and fruits

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:10%
and whatnot, right?

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's fresh juice.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:09.650 align:middle line:90%
It has to be fresh.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.120 align:middle line:90%
It has to be organic.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I only used organic
fresh carrots.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:84%
There's essentially carrot
and Granny Smith apple juice.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.950 align:middle line:10%
It's approximately half
of them, the other half

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:10%
are green vegetable
juice with Granny Smith.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:10%
And they have certain
vegetables that--

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:10%
certain greens that are
expected to be used.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:10%
>> So you said 12
to 13 times a day.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So what are you
juicing once an hour?

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Once an hour starting around
7:00 or 8:00 in the morning.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:10%
That's almost a full
time job sometimes.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:10%
>> It is.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.000 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:10%
You feel like-- at
least I felt like I

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.780 align:middle line:10%
was chained to the juicer.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:10%
The first two years, the first
one and a half to two years,

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:10%
you don't really go outside
the house very much.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:10%
Because you've got to be
constantly there and resting.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.150 align:middle line:10%
Rest is very important.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Around a year and a half,
I started to play tennis

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:90%
because I was very active.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.255 align:middle line:84%
It was hard for me to
rest for that long.

00:30:07.255 --> 00:30:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>> You look like an athlete.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm currently training
for a triathlon.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.740 align:middle line:10%
But, yeah, I'm used to playing
basketball, baseball, tennis,

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:10%
swimming, all that, so
after a year and a half,

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:24.020 align:middle line:10%
I started to introduce
that to the protocol.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.600 align:middle line:10%
>> So you've got juicing
12, 13 times a day.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.894 align:middle line:84%
What are the other components
of the Gerson therapy?

00:30:28.894 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good question.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.870 align:middle line:10%
It's essentially in the
first year and a half,

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:39.650 align:middle line:10%
it's three organic vegan meals,
a lot of essentially for lunch

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.530 align:middle line:10%
and dinner, it's salad.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:10%
Organic salad, organic hypocrity
soup, and then essentially,

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.180 align:middle line:10%
there's a whole menu
of items you can cook,

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:58.159 align:middle line:10%
but it's a lot of intake,
a lot of caloric intake.

00:30:58.159 --> 00:30:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it sure seems like it.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:84%
You're juicing 12
times plus 3 meals?

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.189 align:middle line:10%
>> Uh-huh.

00:31:03.189 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying all kinds
of good nutrients to fuel

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.140 align:middle line:90%
your body.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:10%
So what else is part
of the Gerson therapy?

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:14.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the morning, of
course, is organic oatmeal,

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.160 align:middle line:10%
slow cooked organic oatmeal.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:17.720 align:middle line:10%
So that's important.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.820 align:middle line:10%
Apart from that,
the coffee enema

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.540 align:middle line:10%
is very important,
because all the juicing,

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:10%
all the healthy eating
breaks down cancer toxins,

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:31.140 align:middle line:10%
breaks down tumors,
breaks down cancer cells.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.440 align:middle line:10%
Well, it essentially,
when it's broken down

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:10%
it goes to the liver most
of it, and when that happens

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.065 align:middle line:10%
there's a danger
of developing, I

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:10%
believe it's called
a liver coma.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.670 align:middle line:10%
It's just too much
for the liver.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.120 align:middle line:10%
>> It shuts down, sure.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:47.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where the
coffee enema comes in.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:10%
The coffee enema
essentially stimulates

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:58.640 align:middle line:10%
bile ducts of the liver
to excrete the toxins.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.550 align:middle line:10%
So without that,
as you can imagine,

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:10%
when there's a heavy tumor
load, such as in my case,

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:10%
it's hard to imagine how
that would be excreted

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.970 align:middle line:10%
without it when you're
just constantly breaking it

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.530 align:middle line:10%
down and breaking it down.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.170 align:middle line:10%
And part of the
process of healing

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.990 align:middle line:10%
is a healing reaction,
also called a flare up,

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:10%
where it feels like
you're getting worse,

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:26.540 align:middle line:10%
maybe it looks like
you're getting worse.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.549 align:middle line:84%
And the process
is could be fever,

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:90%
could be a lot of things.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:31.670 align:middle line:10%
There are a lot of
signs of it, but it's

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:10%
very important for the, as
I call it a Gerson thriver,

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.310 align:middle line:10%
it's very important
for a Gerson thriver

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:10%
to understand the signs
of these flare ups,

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:53.160 align:middle line:10%
so that they don't go running
to conventional treatment.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.212 align:middle line:10%
That's not good for the body.

00:32:56.212 --> 00:32:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you feel when
you were going through this?

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.504 align:middle line:10%
You're going through a
year and a half of juicing,

00:33:00.504 --> 00:33:02.295 align:middle line:10%
you feel like you're
chained to the juicer,

00:33:02.295 --> 00:33:04.060 align:middle line:10%
but on the flip
side of the coin,

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:10%
people are going through
chemo and radiation.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:84%
They may be throwing up
for a year and a half.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.511 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'd say that even though
you're chained to the juicer,

00:33:09.511 --> 00:33:12.740 align:middle line:84%
how are you feeling overall
as far as your health is

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.970 align:middle line:90%
concerned?

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.420 align:middle line:10%
You know, even though
I say that it's

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:21.365 align:middle line:10%
like being chained to a juicer,
it's complete gratitude.

00:33:21.365 --> 00:33:23.240 align:middle line:10%
Complete gratitude,
because there's nowhere I

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.470 align:middle line:10%
would rather be than to
be chained to a juicer.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:33.870 align:middle line:10%
And really, I felt better than
I've ever felt internally.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.010 align:middle line:10%
It's just glowing.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.220 align:middle line:10%
It's just a glowing wellness.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:10%
To be blessed to be able to
consume that many juices,

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:50.210 align:middle line:10%
you know especially organic
juices, it's really a blessing.

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:54.200 align:middle line:10%
I like to juice every
day, and today, that

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:59.230 align:middle line:10%
consists of organic carrots,
organic spinach, kale,

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.430 align:middle line:10%
and chard.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:06.600 align:middle line:10%
And I like to drink about a
30 ounce of that every day.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.860 align:middle line:10%
You know, dealing with cancer,
it's similar to diabetes,

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.810 align:middle line:10%
I believe, in that
it's a constant.

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:10%
You've got to
constantly be surveying

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:10%
what you're eating, what
you're putting in your body

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.360 align:middle line:10%
so that you stay healthy.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:28.629 align:middle line:10%
My message is that, eight
years out, the body of evidence

00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:10%
is there.

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:30.449 align:middle line:10%
The body of evidence.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:31.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:10%
>> And the verdict is in, the
Gerson therapy heals cancer.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.915 align:middle line:10%
>> Clearly, it has worked well.

00:34:40.915 --> 00:34:42.790 align:middle line:10%
What would be your
message to cancer patients

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:44.679 align:middle line:10%
that are watching this?

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:46.480 align:middle line:10%
What is your message
to them about being

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:10%
diagnosed with cancer?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:10%
So often, you'll hear from an
oncologist, you're terminal.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:53.469 align:middle line:10%
You know, get your
affairs in order.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:57.790 align:middle line:10%
What's your message
to cancer patients?

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:10%
>> I would say if you're
given that diagnosis,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.120 align:middle line:10%
that it is an opinion.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:09.010 align:middle line:10%
It's an opinion from
someone who has been trained

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:10%
in cancer terminology,
cancer as they know it,

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.570 align:middle line:10%
but not to be swayed.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:18.100 align:middle line:10%
Not to be swayed
in that direction

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:24.070 align:middle line:10%
because that whole
system is a failure.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.955 align:middle line:84%
Anyone dying of
cancer is a failure.

00:35:25.955 --> 00:35:26.830 align:middle line:90%
That should not have.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:33.520 align:middle line:90%


00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I was 26.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.650 align:middle line:10%
OK, so I was a newlywed,
been married two years,

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.930 align:middle line:10%
I was working in the
real estate business,

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:10%
buying rental property
and renovating houses,

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.050 align:middle line:10%
and I'd been doing that
just a couple of years.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:52.750 align:middle line:10%
So I really had just kind
of felt like I was just

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.910 align:middle line:10%
being an adult. You know I mean?

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Like out of college
a couple of years,

00:35:56.830 --> 00:36:02.467 align:middle line:84%
working, newlywed, and I
started having abdominal pain.

00:36:02.467 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And this was what year?

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>> This was 2003.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> And I thought I had an ulcer.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd never had any illness
before, never had any major--

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.140 align:middle line:84%
the flu when I was a kid or
something, but nothing major.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I don't
know, is just an ulcer?

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Like what's going on?

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And I had this pain
that would come and go,

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of
like Groundhog Day,

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.750 align:middle line:84%
because every morning
I would wake up,

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and I'd immediately think
like, how do I feel?

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.878 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be like, I feel good.

00:36:31.878 --> 00:36:32.852 align:middle line:90%
OK, no pain.

00:36:32.852 --> 00:36:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go
throughout the day,

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:38.390 align:middle line:84%
but then I would get these
twinges of pain most days,

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.537 align:middle line:84%
and I'd be like, oh,
there it is again.

00:36:40.537 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go to sleep
kind of worried about it,

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.127 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd wake up,
well, no pain, right?

00:36:45.127 --> 00:36:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
went on for many months,

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and I kept thinking
maybe my body

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.780 align:middle line:84%
would get better because my body
had always healed in the past,

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that the
body is designed to heal.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was I didn't
make any changes in my life,

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.100 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.724 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
cancer at the time,

00:37:01.724 --> 00:37:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and so I just kept
living my life the way

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I was living it, which was
in a very unhealthy way.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And this pain got
worse and worse,

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, I
went to a doctor,

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and they thought I had an ulcer
and gave me some medication

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.420 align:middle line:90%
that didn't help.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I-- threw a series
of doctors appointments,

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.630 align:middle line:84%
eventually ended up at a
gastroenterologist, who

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.570 align:middle line:84%
did a colonoscopy and found
a golf ball sized tumor

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:90%
in my large intestine.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of the procedure,
they had put me under,

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and I woke up, and I
was still medicated.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:90%
It was like where am I?

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.960 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor came in,
and he basically said,

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:90%
we found this tumor.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.000 align:middle line:90%
You might have cancer.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.440 align:middle line:90%
We have to send it to the lab.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And my wife started crying
on the nurse's shoulder,

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.210 align:middle line:90%
and I was just like what?

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.380 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I wasn't even--

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You were that at that
time, how old were you?

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I was 26.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> 26-years-old.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And so at that moment,
I wasn't even sober.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't even
really make sense.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It just felt like a dream
that I didn't understand.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.670 align:middle line:84%
But a couple of days later, I
got the call from the doctor,

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and he said, listen,
the lab report

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.050 align:middle line:84%
came back, you
have colon cancer.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.090 align:middle line:90%
And so that was heavy.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.337 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of when my
life came to a grinding halt.

00:38:28.337 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:84%
They took out the
tumor, they took out

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.134 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of lymph nodes.

00:38:31.134 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
The surgeon said, look, I took
out everything I could see.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We got clear margins,
but you're going

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:84%
to need 9 to 12 months
of chemotherapy.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So they brought an oncologist
into my hospital room

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to introduce me to
him, and I thought,

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:51.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, this is my life
now, and I guess I have to--

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.077 align:middle line:84%
I'm a cancer patient, and I
have to do what that entails.

00:38:56.077 --> 00:38:58.660 align:middle line:84%
But there were a few things that
happened in the hospital that

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.210 align:middle line:84%
were very serendipitous
that really started

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:04.270 align:middle line:84%
the wheels turning,
and one of them

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:84%
was the first meal
that they served me.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is after
your operation?

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> After my operation.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Where they removed 18 inches.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they cut out 18
inches of my large intestine,

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.890 align:middle line:90%
18 centimeters, a third, right?

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And the first meal they
served me was a sloppy joe,

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'm kind of famous
for the sloppy joe story

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.610 align:middle line:84%
because it's the most
ridiculous food that you

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:90%
could serve a sick person.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the best example of
the worst cafeteria food.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:36.400 align:middle line:90%
You know I mean?

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.590 align:middle line:84%
What is the worst cafeteria
food you can think of?

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a sloppy joe.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what they gave
me, first meal after cutting

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:46.964 align:middle line:84%
the abdomen open,
removing part of my guts.

00:39:46.964 --> 00:39:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And they set it in front
of me, and I was just

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.560 align:middle line:84%
looking at it
going, this doesn't

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.020 align:middle line:84%
seem like the best
thing for me right now.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Just innately you knew.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't
even eat that--

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to
eat that any time, OK?

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm never in the mood
for a sloppy joe,

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:08.020 align:middle line:84%
and so not only was I not
really happy about that

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:84%
as a food choice, but I just
thought, this is a hospital.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.930 align:middle line:90%
This is full of sick people.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't we be feeding
them better than this like?

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't I be eating like
some applesauce or something?

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.660 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I really didn't
know anything about nutrition,

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:29.319 align:middle line:84%
but just my instincts, the
red flag kind of went up.

00:40:29.319 --> 00:40:30.985 align:middle line:84%
The next thing that
happened was the day

00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
I was checking out
from the hospital,

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.670 align:middle line:84%
the surgeon came
in to check on me.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, is there
anything I need to eat or avoid

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.790 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:42.205 align:middle line:84%
Because I was a
little concerned.

00:40:42.205 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
go home and like

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.960 align:middle line:84%
eat something like some
Doritos and like screw it up.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, naw, just
don't lift anything heavier

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.370 align:middle line:90%
than a beer.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the
nutritional advice you got?

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.750 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I reluctantly agreed to
go see an oncologist.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.784 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting in
the clinic in Memphis--

00:41:02.784 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
well, first of all, the
parking lot is packed.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't even get
a parking place,

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.560 align:middle line:90%
and the waiting room is packed.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I sit down, I'm looking around,
and there's no one in there

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.080 align:middle line:90%
even remotely near my age.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm 26, I've got long shaggy
hair, a handlebar mustache,

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:22.489 align:middle line:84%
like rock dude, and I'm just
kind of checking it out.

00:41:22.489 --> 00:41:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Who else is in the cancer club?

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It was me and a bunch of
seniors, senior citizens.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Not high school or
college seniors.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, God,
I don't belong here.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The television was on and
out comes Jack LaLanne right

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.310 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sitting in the
cancer clinic couch,

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and he starts going off
about nutrition and fruits

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables, and
the reason we're sick

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.240 align:middle line:84%
is because we're all
eating junk food, right?

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And if man made
it, don't eat it.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
oh, man, he's just

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.680 align:middle line:84%
speaking to me through
the television right now.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:84%
He's reaffirming
everything that I had just

00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.450 align:middle line:90%
started to understand.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And we go in to see
the oncologist finally,

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.771 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's like you wait
in a waiting room for an hour,

00:42:05.771 --> 00:42:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and then they put you
in a smaller waiting

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.460 align:middle line:84%
room for another hour, and then
you get in another little room.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, the
oncologist comes in,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.510 align:middle line:90%
and it was just very robotic.

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, they see 20 patients,
30, 40 patients a day,

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and he just comes in, and
he looked at my chart,

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure for two minutes.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.270 align:middle line:90%
What's this guy got?

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Comes in and gives me
the standard pitch.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, you know, you've
got stage 3 colon cancer.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.530 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:84%
With therapies, you have a 60%
chance of living five years.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.910 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> At the age of 26, what
did you think of those odds?

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was not
impressed by those odds.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, gee, that's not
much better than a coin toss.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.960 align:middle line:90%
50/50.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Not much.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him if there
were any alternative

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:59.150 align:middle line:84%
therapies available, and he
said, no, there are none.

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.922 align:middle line:84%
If you don't do
chemotherapy, you're insane.

00:43:01.922 --> 00:43:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> He literally
said you're insane?

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I asked him about
the raw food diet.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.090 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, you can't do that.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.089 align:middle line:90%
It will fight the chemo.

00:43:09.089 --> 00:43:11.377 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.377 --> 00:43:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Why would it fight the chemo?

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>> At the time, I was
like, what does that mean?

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, later, I realized,
I found out that the raw food

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:20.412 align:middle line:84%
died is a very aggressive
detoxification diet,

00:43:20.412 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and when you're on
a raw food diet,

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:24.530 align:middle line:84%
your body starts kicking
out chemotherapy.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't do what
they want it to do.

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't destroy your body,
and it doesn't do the damage

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.720 align:middle line:84%
they want it to do,
and so they don't want

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.020 align:middle line:90%
you to be on a raw food diet.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.350 align:middle line:84%
The other reason is is
because chemotherapy is also

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.840 align:middle line:84%
very destructive on
your immune system

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria that's normally
harmless on an apple,

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:47.090 align:middle line:84%
let's say, could pose a
potential problem in your body

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.960 align:middle line:84%
because your immune system
is so weak from chemo.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.252 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want
you to do raw food.

00:43:53.252 --> 00:43:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I was already on
the raw food diet.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:55.793 align:middle line:90%
I'd been on it for a week.

00:43:55.793 --> 00:43:56.900 align:middle line:90%
I was like hardcore.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.520 align:middle line:90%
I just adopted it, right?

00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.730 align:middle line:90%
I was excited about it.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:00.530 align:middle line:90%
I felt--

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Going into the clinic, I felt
very confident about what

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.790 align:middle line:90%
I was doing.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.390 align:middle line:90%


00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:13.212 align:middle line:84%
And everything
else he's told me,

00:44:13.212 --> 00:44:14.920 align:middle line:84%
everything else the
oncologist said to me

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:20.470 align:middle line:84%
is really a blur,
because he really

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:24.220 align:middle line:84%
scared me so bad that
I kind of shut down.

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I walked into
the clinic confident,

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:33.039 align:middle line:90%
and I walked out terrified.

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the desk,
and I made an appointment

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.190 align:middle line:84%
to get a port put in
to start chemotherapy.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:42.460 align:middle line:10%
And my wife and I walked
out into the parking lot,

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:46.600 align:middle line:10%
and we sat in her car, and
we held hands and we cried,

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:52.210 align:middle line:10%
and we prayed, and we
were just terrified.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.690 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that
was on a Friday,

00:44:55.690 --> 00:44:57.640 align:middle line:10%
because I had a few
days before they were

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.034 align:middle line:10%
supposed to put this port in.

00:44:59.034 --> 00:45:00.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it might have
been like a Monday

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.860 align:middle line:90%
or Tuesday or something.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you say a port,
they're putting in a port

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have to
inject you with chemo,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.950 align:middle line:84%
they can do is to put it
directly into the port each

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:09.130 align:middle line:90%
time?

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:10.920 align:middle line:90%
They put a port in your chest.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.960 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a direct
line into your arteries

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.660 align:middle line:84%
or whatever your
veins, arteries,

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.830 align:middle line:90%
it's easier than giving you a--

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>> IV.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It destroys your veins,
so port is a better way

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.610 align:middle line:84%
to do it because chemotherapy
is so toxic that it destroys

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.890 align:middle line:90%
your veins.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, they just
scared me so bad

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:37.340 align:middle line:84%
that I agreed to chemotherapy,
even though I had originally

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.140 align:middle line:90%
decided not to.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:41.410 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:44.562 align:middle line:84%
But over that weekend, I kind
of came to my senses again,

00:45:44.562 --> 00:45:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and I thought about my life,
and I thought about this book,

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and I thought
about Jack Lalanne,

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and I thought about the weird
stuff the oncologist said

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:51.070 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.620 align:middle line:84%
One other thing
he said, I forgot.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:58.430 align:middle line:84%
He said, in sort of the middle
of his pitch, he said, look,

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.370 align:middle line:84%
man, he's like, look,
I'm not telling you this

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:90%
because I need your business.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought why in
the world would you say that?

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.080 align:middle line:84%
What does business
have to do with it?

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And then it was, wait a
minute, this is a business.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.640 align:middle line:90%
This is his business.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.125 align:middle line:90%
He needs patients to make money.

00:46:14.125 --> 00:46:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is the same
oncologist who told you you

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.800 align:middle line:84%
were insane if you
didn't do chemo.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Same guy.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.915 align:middle line:90%
And it was like a Freudian slip.

00:46:20.915 --> 00:46:21.790 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Either that or it
was the push away,

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:28.025 align:middle line:84%
which is a sales technique,
where you kind of give someone

00:46:28.025 --> 00:46:29.650 align:middle line:84%
like I don't really
need your business,

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.105 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of makes them
want to do business with you.

00:46:32.105 --> 00:46:32.980 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But I thought about everything,
and I thought, you know what?

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Nutrition makes
more sense to me.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.122 align:middle line:84%
I would rather
overdose on nutrition

00:46:44.122 --> 00:46:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and give my body
everything that it

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:49.180 align:middle line:84%
can use to repair and regenerate
and detoxify and heal,

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and trust God to lead
me in the process

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:56.380 align:middle line:84%
than let someone who doesn't
even know me at all, probably

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:05.440 align:middle line:84%
has already forgotten my name,
poison me and experiment on me

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.780 align:middle line:84%
with a 60% chance of
living five years.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.450 align:middle line:84%
I found out later
that he was lying.

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.970 align:middle line:84%
What he told me was
that I had a 60% chance

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:18.870 align:middle line:84%
of living five years, but that's
the average for all cancer

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:19.670 align:middle line:90%
patients.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you take every
cancer patient,

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:23.050 align:middle line:84%
lump them in one group,
and average it out,

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.622 align:middle line:84%
you get 60% of them make
it to the five year mark.

00:47:25.622 --> 00:47:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean they're
cancer free at five years,

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.830 align:middle line:84%
it just means they
have a beating heart.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:31.205 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
on life support.

00:47:31.205 --> 00:47:32.621 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
not knock, knock,

00:47:32.621 --> 00:47:33.940 align:middle line:90%
knocking on heaven's door.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.100 align:middle line:84%
They are dying,
but they still are

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.880 align:middle line:84%
counted as a success
toward five year survival.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, the odds for stage
3 colon cancer, stage 3C,

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.500 align:middle line:84%
were about 30% make
it to five years.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And only 16% make it 10 years.

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So here I am, 10 years
without their therapies.

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so 10 years
out, and cancer free.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So you decided not
to do chemotherapy?

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So before you got
the port in, I assume?

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I was a no show for the port.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.200 align:middle line:84%
After that, they sent
me a certified letter,

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:84%
they were calling
my house, they were

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:18.190 align:middle line:84%
after me to try to get
me to do chemotherapy.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And I just was avoiding their
calls, and like leave me alone.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I've made up my mind.

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.750 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm doing.

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever talk to the
oncologist about the phony

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.470 align:middle line:84%
statistics or the incorrect
statistics that he gave you?

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:34.879 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly, that
was not accurate.

00:48:34.879 --> 00:48:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I never went back.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.420 align:middle line:90%
And I know why he did it.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.520 align:middle line:84%
He did it because he
knew the truth was

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.232 align:middle line:90%
extremely discouraging.

00:48:41.232 --> 00:48:42.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, if he'd come
in and said, look,

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.870 align:middle line:84%
with the therapies
we have available,

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.680 align:middle line:84%
you've got about a 30%
chance of living five years,

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I would have been out
the door in five seconds.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.660 align:middle line:90%
See ya.

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.190 align:middle line:84%
But he told me 60%
because he thought, well,

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.080 align:middle line:84%
you know maybe this
will sound better.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.400 align:middle line:90%
This will be more encouraging.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it'll give him
more hope, right?

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.295 align:middle line:84%
It will make the treatment
sound more appealing, right?

00:49:03.295 --> 00:49:06.875 align:middle line:84%
60 is way better than 30,
so that's why he did it.

00:49:06.875 --> 00:49:07.750 align:middle line:90%
That's why he did it.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just basic economics.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.530 align:middle line:84%
They need a steady supply
of patients to make money,

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and doctors aren't bad
people, but they're trained--

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.190 align:middle line:84%
they go to med school,
and they have residency,

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and it takes 15, 20
years for a doctor

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to go through all the
training, and actually

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.500 align:middle line:84%
go through enough practice
before they realize

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that everything they've
been trained to do

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.880 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really work, and
that most of their patients

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.770 align:middle line:90%
end up dying.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And by that time, it's too
late to change careers,

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and they're making a
high six figure income.

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:44.580 align:middle line:84%
The average oncologist makes
almost $300,000 a year,

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and yet, in a survey that just
came out about a month ago

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.340 align:middle line:84%
on Medscape, 52% of
oncologists reported

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.800 align:middle line:84%
that they were unsatisfied
with their income.

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.130 align:middle line:90%
And the average makes over 3--

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>> $290,000 a year.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.029 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a lot of money.

00:50:04.029 --> 00:50:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a lot of money
to be unsatisfied about.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's not
enough apparently.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Guess it's not enough.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:16.137 align:middle line:84%
So from there, basically I
was totally trusting in God

00:50:16.137 --> 00:50:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to lead me at that
point, because it's like,

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:20.910 align:middle line:84%
all right, everybody
thinks I'm crazy.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm alone.

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.170 align:middle line:90%
I was very much alone.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So once you made the decision
to avoid chemo and to overdose

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:32.100 align:middle line:84%
on nutrition, as you put
it, you told your family.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.990 align:middle line:90%
What was their reaction like?

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:37.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they weren't
comfortable with it.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:41.820 align:middle line:84%
They thought I was being
stubborn and hardheaded and

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.800 align:middle line:90%
foolish.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.907 align:middle line:84%
My mom was a big
supporter of me.

00:50:45.907 --> 00:50:47.490 align:middle line:84%
My mom's always been
into health food.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:49.920 align:middle line:84%
She's always been sort
of a health junkie,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.734 align:middle line:84%
and so she was a huge, huge
ally for me at that time.

00:50:54.734 --> 00:50:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And I love my wife,
we're still married.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.140 align:middle line:84%
We've been together 18
years, but she was terrified.

00:50:59.140 --> 00:50:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Congratulations.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:00.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:51:00.775 --> 00:51:01.900 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know what to do.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.050 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know how to
help me, and she really

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:06.425 align:middle line:84%
thought I was making a mistake,
and a lot of other people

00:51:06.425 --> 00:51:07.270 align:middle line:90%
did too.

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But I had to trust that
God was leading me,

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:11.460 align:middle line:84%
that he had answered
my prayer, and if so,

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:16.680 align:middle line:84%
that I could trust that that
was the route that would lead me

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:20.010 align:middle line:90%
ultimately to health.

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had very little support,
and I was very much alone

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:25.890 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But what's neat is my
mom had a bunch of books

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:30.690 align:middle line:84%
about alternative
cancer therapy,

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:32.520 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of books
about health and stuff

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.850 align:middle line:84%
written by Paul Bragg, and
all kinds of these just

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:38.310 align:middle line:84%
great health books
that she had collected

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:40.570 align:middle line:84%
over the years for
no real reason.

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I started
reading and researching

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and found out about different
authors and books and health

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:48.370 align:middle line:84%
leaders and experts, and I would
mention them to her she'd say,

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:90%
oh, I have that book.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm like you've got this
library of books for me.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:56.204 align:middle line:90%
There was no other reason.

00:51:56.204 --> 00:51:58.620 align:middle line:84%
She was like saving them up
for me, and didn't realize it.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> She was collecting them
for you over the years,

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know what the
purpose was until now?

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and it was
stuff obviously--

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:07.420 align:middle line:84%
she was interested in them,
but she had saved them all.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that was amazing I
just knew God was in control.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I knew he was working.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And so what did
my diet look like?

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:19.230 align:middle line:84%
It was very simple, and I think
a hardcore nutritional approach

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:22.670 align:middle line:84%
to cancer needs to be
very simple because there

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:24.450 align:middle line:90%
are a lot of options out there.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:28.207 align:middle line:84%
It can get very complicated,
and a lot of people have--

00:52:28.207 --> 00:52:30.040 align:middle line:84%
they're seeing so many
different directions,

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.530 align:middle line:84%
they don't even know where to
go, and they get paralyzed.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized, OK, what
is the most fundamental

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.910 align:middle line:84%
foundational part of my healing
approach, and that's food.

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get as much
nutrition in my body

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.960 align:middle line:84%
as I can from the earth,
and so I started juicing,

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and I drank about 64 ounces
of vegetable juice every day,

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:53.820 align:middle line:90%
mostly carrot juice.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I ate giant salads full
of cruciferous and allium

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:57.210 align:middle line:90%
vegetables.

00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:middle line:84%
That's broccoli, cauliflower,
kale, cabbage, onions, garlic,

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.290 align:middle line:84%
peppers, just spinach,
all that good stuff.

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:06.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds good.

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Just the amazing giant salad.

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:10.750 align:middle line:84%
We shared one at
Jason's Deli recently.

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Just a giant salad full of
like all this really amazing

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.610 align:middle line:84%
food from the earth that
was put here for us,

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:18.769 align:middle line:90%
and I ate that twice a day.

00:53:18.769 --> 00:53:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
make fruit smoothies

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:22.800 align:middle line:84%
with a fresh
coconut and berries,

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.300 align:middle line:84%
two cups of blueberries,
blackberries, raspberries,

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.280 align:middle line:90%
strawberries.

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Berries are very potent
anti-cancer fruits,

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.800 align:middle line:90%
and that was it.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.440 align:middle line:84%
That was the daily diet,
and it was every day,

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.480 align:middle line:90%
and I did that for 90 days.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.300 align:middle line:84%
There was a 100% raw
food for 90 days.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.359 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
a naturopath, and he

00:53:41.359 --> 00:53:43.650 align:middle line:84%
checked my blood work and my
urine and my hair samples,

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:44.940 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of stuff.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:46.764 align:middle line:84%
And he helped me
modify the diet.

00:53:46.764 --> 00:53:48.180 align:middle line:84%
He had me on
different supplements

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.610 align:middle line:84%
that he thought would help
boost my immune system,

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:54.875 align:middle line:84%
help deal with any
parasites, or help detoxify.

00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Just sort of
address those things

00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:58.890 align:middle line:84%
that are common to a
lot of cancer patients.

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is the product
of a sick body.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.540 align:middle line:84%
You're sick-- you have
cancer, because you're sick.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Not the other way around.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So cancer is
really the symptom?

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Cancer is the
symptom of a sick body.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot cut a tumor off
or shrink a tumor or poison

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:22.212 align:middle line:84%
a tumor and expect to stay
well and stay healthy,

00:54:22.212 --> 00:54:24.170 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
addressing the real problem.

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:26.240 align:middle line:84%
You're only addressing
the symptom.

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's like cutting off your
nose to get rid of a cold.

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:32.840 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't solve the
real underlying problem.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:39.600 align:middle line:90%


00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2008, when I was 26, we
had been married for almost

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.170 align:middle line:90%
three months.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with nodular
lymphocyte predominant

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Stage 2.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I had a mass in my armpit
and another in my neck.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.630 align:middle line:90%


00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:03.140 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, it was definitely a
time where I was very afraid,

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:09.770 align:middle line:10%
and after they gave us our
initial protocol that they were

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:14.660 align:middle line:10%
going to suggest, which was six
rounds of chemo and radiation

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:20.450 align:middle line:10%
to follow that, and they removed
the lymph node, the largest

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:23.000 align:middle line:10%
one, which is about the size
of a lemon, from my armpit.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.990 align:middle line:84%
You did not have a
peace about that.

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:31.960 align:middle line:84%
You want to tell that
part of the story?

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, she went in and she
got the lymph node removed,

00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:39.500 align:middle line:90%
and it came back.

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:43.760 align:middle line:84%
After it went to several
different hospitals,

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.342 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
quite figure out what--

00:55:46.342 --> 00:55:48.800 align:middle line:84%
they knew it was cancer, but
they couldn't pinpoint exactly

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.620 align:middle line:84%
what kind of cancer
it was, and so

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.920 align:middle line:84%
after about three weeks of
waiting, and then hoping

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.070 align:middle line:84%
that it was something else,
somehow something else.

00:55:57.070 --> 00:55:57.870 align:middle line:90%
It came back--

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.440 align:middle line:90%


00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a very rare cancer,
and they weren't quite sure how

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.950 align:middle line:84%
to treat it, because one
doctor said the extreme chemo,

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:12.050 align:middle line:84%
another doctor said, well,
we might be able to give you

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:14.720 align:middle line:84%
a monoclonal antibody
called ritoxin,

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and see how you do first.

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And then if it doesn't
respond, then maybe

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.560 align:middle line:84%
we'll go towards the R
top chemo, which was what

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.930 align:middle line:90%
the first doctor suggested.

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And see, of course,
being a newlywed family

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and facing cancer, you're up
for the most nontoxic route

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:29.930 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So for us, we were keeping
our fingers crossed

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.250 align:middle line:84%
that there was some
sort of clinical trial

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:36.590 align:middle line:84%
or some other option
that we could pursue.

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:42.986 align:middle line:84%
And after it came back
positive for stage 2A?

00:56:42.986 --> 00:56:44.930 align:middle line:90%
B?

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:46.270 align:middle line:90%
I can't even remember now.

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> A.

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So we were given the
tour of the hospital,

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:55.250 align:middle line:84%
we were in getting the
sort of the amenities

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:57.230 align:middle line:90%
of the chemotherapy suite--

00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> The wig shop.

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:00.770 align:middle line:90%
This was all very quick.

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The plush recliners,
and the view of the forest.

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The upper level, sort of
penthouse view of the nice

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:10.546 align:middle line:90%
forests of Atlanta.

00:57:10.546 --> 00:57:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you're walking
through that chemo room,

00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and there's these people
receiving their chemotherapy,

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.820 align:middle line:84%
you don't see the forest and the
plush chairs and the personal

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.620 align:middle line:90%
television.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You're having this sort
of out of body experience.

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you see these
sick, sick, sick people.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And people that just almost
look like a shell or a ghost

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.950 align:middle line:84%
of themselves, and your
mind is just beside itself.

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the midst
of all the chaos,

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.840 align:middle line:84%
as we were going
through this room,

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.822 align:middle line:84%
and again, this is only
what, our third appointment?

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, something like that.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.660 align:middle line:90%


00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>> She was in front of me, and
we were both getting the tour,

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:52.277 align:middle line:84%
and I just remember sitting
there just having this crazy,

00:57:52.277 --> 00:57:54.360 align:middle line:84%
this cannot be happening
to us, what are we going?

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:55.980 align:middle line:84%
All this sort of
panicky thoughts,

00:57:55.980 --> 00:57:58.675 align:middle line:90%
like one moment at a time.

00:57:58.675 --> 00:57:59.550 align:middle line:90%
One breath at a time.

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> This is right after they had
told us about the 30% to 70%

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.792 align:middle line:84%
chance of infertility
because of the R top.

00:58:04.792 --> 00:58:05.625 align:middle line:90%
>> That's important.

00:58:05.625 --> 00:58:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is in a very,
very harsh chemotherapy.

00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, our oncologist,
his residency, was it?

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> At MD Anderson.

00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Wasn't it MD Anderson?

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:16.824 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
called residency.

00:58:16.824 --> 00:58:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were
the ones to say--

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he had not had a lot
of experience with this type

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:24.690 align:middle line:84%
of cancer, so he referred to his
colleagues back at MD Anderson,

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and so the best recommendation
from one of the best cancer

00:58:29.790 --> 00:58:34.530 align:middle line:84%
hospitals in the world came
back, chemo, radiation,

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:37.460 align:middle line:90%
surgery.

00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And because of that, they
gave us that 30% to 70% chance

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.030 align:middle line:84%
giant window of infertility,
he actually referred us--

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:45.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Your nails are going to--

00:58:45.422 --> 00:58:47.880 align:middle line:84%
your stomach is going to have
these issues, and by the way,

00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.190 align:middle line:84%
your ovaries will shut
down, but don't worry--

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:52.410 align:middle line:90%
>> They may or may not.

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Your fertility may
or may not return,

00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to refer us
to a fertility specialist

00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:00.390 align:middle line:84%
to get eggs frozen or embryos
frozen, which we were like--

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:01.802 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were
getting all this,

00:59:01.802 --> 00:59:03.510 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to make
all these decisions.

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:04.464 align:middle line:90%
We're newlyweds.

00:59:04.464 --> 00:59:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the midst
of all of that,

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:10.360 align:middle line:84%
we were immediately whisked away
to the chemotherapy suite tour,

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.290 align:middle line:90%
and I just remember this--

00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:15.810 align:middle line:84%
the best I can describe it
is, it's almost like a voice,

00:59:15.810 --> 00:59:19.770 align:middle line:84%
but it was Steven
Furtick describes it

00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:22.730 align:middle line:84%
as, if you've ever
heard the voice of God,

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:24.830 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't sound like
a voice, and that I

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:27.330 align:middle line:84%
know sounds totally crazy
when somebody hears that,

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:30.840 align:middle line:90%
but this is the truth.

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It was an unshakable impression
that came through my left ear

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:40.950 align:middle line:84%
perpendicular to the
thoughts I was having,

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:42.990 align:middle line:84%
this is what my mind
was doing, and then

00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:47.040 align:middle line:84%
the most calm, simplistic
statement came into my head

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:53.070 align:middle line:84%
from this sort of 90
degrees offset, and said,

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:54.780 align:middle line:90%
this is not for you.

00:59:54.780 --> 01:00:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We came home and
after calling relatives--

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I cried the most over
and the only thing

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:06.090 align:middle line:84%
I lost sleep about through
this whole ordeal was I

01:00:06.090 --> 01:00:09.210 align:middle line:84%
felt like I was mourning
the children I never had.

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:12.865 align:middle line:84%
And I can't explain it,
except for those words.

01:00:12.865 --> 01:00:14.490 align:middle line:84%
There were these
children that I hadn't

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.870 align:middle line:84%
had yet that I was, in my heart,
I knew I was supposed to have,

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:21.420 align:middle line:84%
but I had this huge
barrier, and this huge wall.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And I kept-- everytime,
I'd say let's just go, make

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.330 align:middle line:90%
the appointment.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:26.038 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, we
had the appointment

01:00:26.038 --> 01:00:30.570 align:middle line:10%
to get the port
put in, and I was

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:32.220 align:middle line:10%
more afraid of the
treatment than I

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.260 align:middle line:10%
was of the actual cancer.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember I found a video
online while researching

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
clinical trials, and of course,
I started at MD Anderson,

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
because they are supposed
to be the best, right?

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So I found a video of the
director of clinical trials,

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.190 align:middle line:90%
or the head--

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.059 align:middle line:90%
the guy who's over.

01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was
the director or head

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:52.891 align:middle line:84%
researcher or what, but
he was in charge of that.

01:00:52.891 --> 01:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
His name was Dr.
Anas Younes, and he

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:58.332 align:middle line:84%
was on video stating at the
end of one of these videos

01:00:58.332 --> 01:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
about MD Anderson
and their trials,

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.665 align:middle line:84%
he was at the end of it
talking in his office

01:01:01.665 --> 01:01:07.260 align:middle line:84%
about how he believes strongly
in clinical trials because he

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
believes in 10 years from
now, we're going to--

01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and this was in like 2006
they made this video,

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:13.826 align:middle line:84%
but 10 years from
now, we're going

01:01:13.826 --> 01:01:16.530 align:middle line:84%
to regard chemotherapy as a
barbaric form of treatment.

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Periodically, she would just
have these emotional outbursts

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:21.482 align:middle line:84%
where she would just want to
do the chemo and want to--

01:01:21.482 --> 01:01:22.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Just get it out of me.

01:01:22.523 --> 01:01:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Just get it out of me.

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:24.480 align:middle line:90%
Just get it out.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.630 align:middle line:90%
I just want it out of me.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:26.940 align:middle line:90%
It's like a scene from aliens.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I just didn't
know any better.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
just this one place.

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Cancer's only here.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>> This cancer's inside of her.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.621 align:middle line:90%
Just going to get it out.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, just get it out of me.

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That was not--

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.624 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not the reality.

01:01:35.624 --> 01:01:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not reality.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:43.747 align:middle line:84%
It's not an option, and being
highly sensitive as it is,

01:01:43.747 --> 01:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Courtney's the sweetest
person in the world,

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and so now she's
got this cancer.

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Her emotions are running
high, I'm like buckling down.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
She's going more into
the emotional state,

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going more into
the I'm going to be the--

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Protector.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Protector.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And save her.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and just do my part to
logically make sure this does--

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So I just remember those
were some really hard times,

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:07.740 align:middle line:84%
and family didn't
understand, and we

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:10.567 align:middle line:84%
were trying to come up quickly
with answers to the questions

01:02:10.567 --> 01:02:11.400 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't know.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:11.735 align:middle line:90%


01:02:11.735 --> 01:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are you not already
going through treatment?

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
It's been three weeks, or it's
been four weeks, or it's been--

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
eventually became six weeks,
and on and on from there.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The real turning
point for me was

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:28.080 align:middle line:84%
one day I got home and
Bill Henderson's book

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
arrived at the
door, and I actually

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.910 align:middle line:90%
started fishing through it.

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Cancer Free,
Your Guide to Gentle Nontoxic

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Healing."

01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:37.950 align:middle line:90%
It just made sense to me.

01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:40.680 align:middle line:84%
It was just like a meant
to be kind of thing,

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.250 align:middle line:90%
because it was simply written.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It was in simple terms, and
he also lays out a protocol.

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And I actually read through it
in probably two or three days,

01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and I decided that I
was going to give it--

01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.872 align:middle line:90%
I think I decided three months.

01:02:59.872 --> 01:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I'll give this three months,
and I'm going to try it,

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to go hardcore.

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone knows me,
I go hardcore on things

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
that I put my mind to
and I accomplish it.

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's running,
or natural childbirth,

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
or a cancer treatment,
whether it's eating.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was a huge change
for me, because Diet Coke

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
and Cheez-its, I'm not joking.

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.570 align:middle line:90%
I didn't eat salads.

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:24.100 align:middle line:90%
I didn't eat vegetables.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.104 align:middle line:84%
Bill recommended a completely
organic raw vegan diet

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
with the Budwig protocol,
which is the cottage

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
cheese, flaxseed oil, and quite
a few supplements, betaglucan

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and vitamin C and
green tea extract

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.890 align:middle line:90%
and a complete multi-vitamin.

01:03:38.890 --> 01:03:42.311 align:middle line:84%
That was more pills than I ever
took in probably my whole life.

01:03:42.311 --> 01:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It just seemed like
every day, I was

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
taken I think 26 supplements
in the morning and 16 at lunch

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:49.440 align:middle line:90%
and 26 at night.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It was just crazy how
much I ended up taking.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And we were
going to a local--

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Essiac tea.

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, Essiac tea.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And we were going
to a local practice

01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:03.820 align:middle line:84%
here that is has almost like
an alternative or integrated

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:07.300 align:middle line:84%
approach to treatments
for different things,

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:12.056 align:middle line:84%
including cancer, and we were
seeing a doctor there who spent

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
an hour and a half with us.

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the
lobby of that office

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:20.230 align:middle line:84%
that we found a "Natural
Awakenings" magazine, which

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
led us to a raw and
living foods institute

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
here in Atlanta called The
Living Foods institute.

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And we went there and did
a 12-day detox program,

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.720 align:middle line:90%
and learned a lot.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Met a lot of people who
were on a similar belief.

01:04:34.886 --> 01:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Met a lot of people, and
it was one of those blessings

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:40.060 align:middle line:90%
along the way for us.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And in the aisles
of Whole Foods,

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.410 align:middle line:84%
where we had begun
shopping exclusively

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:47.680 align:middle line:84%
for nutrient dense foods and
organic foods and so forth,

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.260 align:middle line:84%
we would meet people whose
stories would just come out

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
as we were talking to them
in the aisle about having

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
their brother, their cousin,
that cured themself of stomach

01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
cancer or whatever form
of cancer, et cetera.

01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
like God kept just

01:05:00.850 --> 01:05:03.190 align:middle line:84%
giving us these
reassurances along the way

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
that we were doing
the right thing,

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.360 align:middle line:90%
and that we were going to be OK.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> About four months after
I started my protocol,

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
my anti-cancer protocol, I
found out I was pregnant,

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and I felt honestly a little
irresponsible because--

01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:20.800 align:middle line:90%


01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a big deal.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:23.841 align:middle line:84%
>> Cancer and pregnancy
don't really blend.

01:05:23.841 --> 01:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We'd just sort of gotten our
minds wrapped around this whole

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
situation with cancer, and now
we found out were pregnant.

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those things
of having peace in the chaos.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
just like, OK, here

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:44.020 align:middle line:84%
is this situation we were
told we wouldn't get to be in

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.060 align:middle line:90%
or to enjoy and now here it is.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.550 align:middle line:90%


01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And so after the
morning sickness,

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.300 align:middle line:84%
that was very
challenging, passed,

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.413 align:middle line:84%
I really saved 100%
on my protocol--

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>> With the addition
of some crackers.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.190 align:middle line:84%
>> With the addition
of lots of saltines.

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
I lived for about
three or four weeks

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:11.501 align:middle line:84%
on organic saltines,
almond butter, and apples,

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.500 align:middle line:84%
because I just couldn't
hold anything else down.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But on May 4th, it was
exactly six months--

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed
on November-- or I

01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:22.030 align:middle line:84%
started my alternative
protocol on November 4th,

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and on May 4th, I
found out that I

01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:27.040 align:middle line:84%
was in clinical remission
from the cancer.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And five months later
or six months later,

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
our daughter was born
perfectly healthy,

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and eats better than any
child I know, because that's

01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:38.860 align:middle line:84%
all she's known is vegetables
and more vegetables

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.780 align:middle line:90%
and juice and smoothies.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And here we are
five years later,

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.000 align:middle line:84%
we've actually had
another daughter.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
She's a year old now,
so we're very blessed,

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to shout to
the rooftops that this should

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
definitely be part
of anybody's--

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
just to consider and
to research into.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
There are other options besides
chemotherapy and radiation.

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go or
you find that peace,

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.510 align:middle line:90%
and don't act out of fear.

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:16.160 align:middle line:90%


01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm here in New York City
at Mangia Organics restaurant

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:22.010 align:middle line:90%
with my friend Jason Vale.

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Jason, it is a pleasure to
finally meet you face to face.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:25.910 align:middle line:10%
We've done interviews.

01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:28.040 align:middle line:10%
I think you'll be
me to be honest.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.025 align:middle line:10%
>> Your wrist has
got to be like that.

01:07:30.025 --> 01:07:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>> He's the arm
wrestling champion.

01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'm not going
to arm wrestle you,

01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:35.060 align:middle line:84%
because you'll
probably flip me over.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> You're blushing.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm embarrassed, man,
because you probably would

01:07:37.775 --> 01:07:38.804 align:middle line:90%
knock me off.

01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, Jason
and I have never

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:43.700 align:middle line:84%
met before, but when interviewed
on the radio several times,

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so excited
to interview tonight

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:47.450 align:middle line:84%
because this is
the reason that I

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
got involved with
alternative cancer research

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
almost 20 years ago when my
dad was diagnosed with cancer.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that I did
was to do some research

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and I found Jason's video.

01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
He was on a show called "Extra,"
and they interviewed him

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.722 align:middle line:84%
on the show about
the protocol you

01:08:01.722 --> 01:08:02.930 align:middle line:90%
used to cure your own cancer.

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do is just
get your story tonight, man.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Talk about being diagnosed
and the treatments

01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that you used, and then
eventually the time that you

01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:10.910 align:middle line:90%
spent in jail.

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So, Jason, take it
away, my friend.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Please, interject whenever
you want to keep me on track

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.580 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.910 align:middle line:90%
But when I was 18 years old--

01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
actually, no, when I was
15 years old, honest truth.

01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.654 align:middle line:90%
I felt a pain in my back.

01:08:26.654 --> 01:08:28.029 align:middle line:84%
Later on when we
did research, we

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:29.945 align:middle line:84%
saw that everybody that
had my type of cancer,

01:08:29.945 --> 01:08:32.000 align:middle line:84%
which was called
the Askin's tumor,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.875 align:middle line:90%
it started at 15 years old.

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Like there was only like
15 people diagnosed.

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:38.550 align:middle line:84%
So at 15, I remember,
I had smoked pot.

01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:39.350 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:41.516 align:middle line:84%
But this is a New York thing
at the handball courts.

01:08:41.516 --> 01:08:43.069 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
going home and being

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
real sensitive to my body, and
I felt something in my neck.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I actually said, I'll
never forget the word.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, Lord, if
this is a tumor,

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.800 align:middle line:84%
please don't let it come out
now, because my life, 15,

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
you're in ninth grade, it's
like your life is like--

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.020 align:middle line:90%
you feel great.

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.460 align:middle line:90%
You're the best.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And then nothing happened,
and at 18 years old,

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.275 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I got
really sick at 18 years old.

01:09:04.275 --> 01:09:05.649 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was
in a lot of pain.

01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:07.815 align:middle line:84%
I was playing hanbdall,
that was my thing, handball.

01:09:07.815 --> 01:09:10.439 align:middle line:84%
Everyday, eight hours a day,
six hours a day, excuse me.

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And hitting that ball,
I'd come home at night,

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:15.800 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't lay down anymore.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I had to actually sit
up when I was sleeping.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.452 align:middle line:84%
Or my mother would just my
back, and that was the only

01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:21.660 align:middle line:90%
that that gave me any relief.

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.769 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know what it was,
and I was coughing some.

01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:25.569 align:middle line:90%
I

01:09:25.569 --> 01:09:26.369 align:middle line:90%
Went to camp.

01:09:26.369 --> 01:09:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I actually had to leave camp
from like upstate New York,

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I had to leave in
the middle of--

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the sleepaway camp.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:38.979 align:middle line:84%
And I had a x-ray done, and
they said you have pneumonia.

01:09:38.979 --> 01:09:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if you know,
but when you have pneumonia,

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.934 align:middle line:84%
your whole lung is white,
and that's what it.

01:09:45.934 --> 01:09:47.850 align:middle line:90%
It was white.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a tumor in
your lung, the tumor is white.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So they don't see
this huge tumor, which

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.140 align:middle line:90%
was actually a grapefruit size.

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So about two months later,
I still have pneumonia,

01:09:57.110 --> 01:10:03.537 align:middle line:84%
and the doctor, my personal
doctor, Mr. Rabinowitz, said,

01:10:03.537 --> 01:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
listen, I'm going to put him
in for exploratory surgery,

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:07.550 align:middle line:90%
because this is not going away.

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
I went in for
exploratory surgery,

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.590 align:middle line:84%
they thought I might
have had emphyhema,

01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:13.357 align:middle line:84%
emphyhema is like
a pus pocket that's

01:10:13.357 --> 01:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
om the outside of the lung,
which caused pneumonia

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.419 align:middle line:84%
to stay an extra few
months, and they have

01:10:17.419 --> 01:10:18.710 align:middle line:90%
to kind of go and get that out.

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And you got a chest tube, and
all that stuff, so any way,

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:23.330 align:middle line:90%
they operated on me.

01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up 8 hours
later, because it

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.690 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a normal operation.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:30.230 align:middle line:84%
When they went in,
they found a tumor

01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:32.640 align:middle line:84%
the size of a grapefruit,
a connecting tumor

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.827 align:middle line:90%
the size of a lemon next to it.

01:10:34.827 --> 01:10:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up,
they told me that,

01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't realize
the seriousness of it

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:42.200 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't really
realize anything.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.839 align:middle line:84%
And my mother and father, they
have to get a pathology report,

01:10:46.839 --> 01:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to know in
a week or two if it's cancer

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.930 align:middle line:90%
or not.

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't even thinking
along those lines yet.

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that I'm
sitting still in the hospital,

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and they came back with the
diagnosis that it was cancer.

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:00.864 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very,
very rare cancer.

01:11:00.864 --> 01:11:02.030 align:middle line:90%
It was a very deadly cancer.

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had died
from it in one year.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Less than 20 people in
the world had that cancer.

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:06.990 align:middle line:90%


01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Had a diagnosis.

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.060 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
There's probably much more than
that, but not on the books.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the hospital,
they were really nervous.

01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.480 align:middle line:84%
My mother my father, like I said
on the "Inside Edition, Extra"

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.370 align:middle line:84%
show, they were at
the foot of the bed,

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and they were like
just about crying.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.345 align:middle line:84%
I felt very confident,
and I was brought up--

01:11:28.345 --> 01:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
not that I was
brought up so much

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in the church, which
I was, but I really

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:34.250 align:middle line:90%
had a deep relationship.

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I was praying every day.

01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Halloween, we didn't
go trick or treating.

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:41.660 align:middle line:84%
We actually had a 24 hour prayer
meeting night with the kids.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:45.699 align:middle line:84%
And so I just told them,
listen, there's reason for this.

01:11:45.699 --> 01:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
I told my mother
and my father, and I

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.220 align:middle line:90%
believe it's going to be OK.

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So over that year, after I
got out of the hospital at 18,

01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:55.474 align:middle line:84%
my father took me to
the medical library

01:11:55.474 --> 01:11:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's a good thing
he did, because we

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.846 align:middle line:84%
saw that everybody that
had this type of tumor,

01:11:59.846 --> 01:12:01.535 align:middle line:90%
did either chemo or radiation.

01:12:01.535 --> 01:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Never the chemo and
radiation, but they

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.390 align:middle line:84%
did either chemo or
radiation, and they still

01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:06.980 align:middle line:90%
died within like six months.

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:09.870 align:middle line:84%
One person lived
like eight years.

01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Other than that, everybody
had died right away,

01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and they all had the
tumor originally at 15,

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.250 align:middle line:90%
16 when it came out originally.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Now there's more cases of
it, but back then that's

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:20.797 align:middle line:90%
all that was there.

01:12:20.797 --> 01:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I'm not going
to do chemo or radiation.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:25.830 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I'm going to do
this, because everybody died.

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So I just went right back,
got my hockey equipment out,

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and just went right back
to playing hockey again,

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and literally 12 months
later to the day about,

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:37.020 align:middle line:90%
I was in tremendous pain again.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I went and got a CAT
scan, and by that time,

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I knew how to read
CAT scans because--

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
not that I knew how to
read it so much, except I

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.530 align:middle line:84%
knew that in this spot
if there's any white,

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:47.385 align:middle line:90%
you have a tumor.

01:12:47.385 --> 01:12:47.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not good.

01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I knew that.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.634 align:middle line:84%
So I went in the other room
after they did the CAT scan,

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
and normally, they
don't let you--

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:57.192 align:middle line:84%
the technicians, they don't
give you any diagnosis.

01:12:57.192 --> 01:12:58.150 align:middle line:90%
They're not allowed to.

01:12:58.150 --> 01:12:58.560 align:middle line:90%
They get in trouble.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.850 align:middle line:84%
They don't really let
you look at the stuff,

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:01.050 align:middle line:90%
but they let me look.

01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:01.490 align:middle line:90%
I begged them.

01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:02.448 align:middle line:90%
I said, listen, please.

01:13:02.448 --> 01:13:04.284 align:middle line:84%
This is my life,
my body, and I want

01:13:04.284 --> 01:13:05.450 align:middle line:90%
to know before I get a call.

01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to get a call
from the hospital saying,

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.320 align:middle line:90%
oh, we have news.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Please.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.100 align:middle line:90%
So anyway.

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was there.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I saw it.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.133 align:middle line:84%
Same length tumor, same
like the other time.

01:13:14.133 --> 01:13:15.250 align:middle line:90%
It was just as big.

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Within a year?

01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:16.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Within a year.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960 align:middle line:90%
It was big, it was huge.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.918 align:middle line:90%
It was very aggressive.

01:13:18.918 --> 01:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like just
starting out or anything.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And by this time you
were how old, 18 or so?

01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm 19 now.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.610 align:middle line:90%
>> 19.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I already have the pit once.

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.710 align:middle line:90%
They did the thoracotomy on me.

01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:31.840 align:middle line:84%
They took it out,
and now it came back.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And this time, I remember
I was getting pretty sick.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I was at home.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.180 align:middle line:84%
I was actually laying on
my mother and father's bed.

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
They were sleeping on the
couch, and I couldn't walk.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:47.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it, but the
tumor had a tumor and then,

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.950 align:middle line:84%
remember before I said
there was a lemon piece?

01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a tumor
and then like this trail

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:54.015 align:middle line:90%
that went over to my spine.

01:13:54.015 --> 01:13:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It ate all my spine,
and it was just

01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:58.210 align:middle line:90%
about to eat my spinal column.

01:13:58.210 --> 01:13:59.340 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't hardly walk.

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.381 align:middle line:90%
I was having a hard time.

01:14:00.381 --> 01:14:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I was
stepping before I

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:04.876 align:middle line:84%
hit the ground, and my
mother said, don't worry,

01:14:04.876 --> 01:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
we have an
appointment next week.

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
My father immediately
called the hospital,

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.240 align:middle line:90%
and said we have to come in now.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Because of my
father, I can walk.

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.807 align:middle line:84%
My mother was listening
to what they said.

01:14:16.807 --> 01:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
My father just
steamrolled right over,

01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:20.664 align:middle line:84%
and said we have to get
him to the hospital now.

01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:21.580 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we did.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:22.954 align:middle line:84%
We went to the
hospital, and they

01:14:22.954 --> 01:14:24.746 align:middle line:84%
said, listen, we're
not going to do it now,

01:14:24.746 --> 01:14:26.745 align:middle line:84%
because it's like 12
o'clock at night, whatever,

01:14:26.745 --> 01:14:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to have a
fresh team in the morning,

01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to operate
on you in the morning.

01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:35.900 align:middle line:84%
So morning comes,
and all I remember

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
from that day is that
they laid me down

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.795 align:middle line:84%
on the bed, Dr.
Karsgrove, Dr. Beatty,

01:14:41.795 --> 01:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
this was Sloan-Kettering and
Beth Israel, and Dr. Bergland.

01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:47.486 align:middle line:84%
He was the nerve
doctor that was going

01:14:47.486 --> 01:14:49.360 align:middle line:84%
to take over when they
got to the cancer that

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.640 align:middle line:90%
was near the spine.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Beatty was
the chest doctor.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
He was going to take
it out from there.

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Karsgrove turned out
to be a friend to this day,

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm a good friend to his.

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
He was like an intern at the
time, a resident, whatever.

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So they told me, OK, count
back from 10, and by the time

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.410 align:middle line:84%
you get to 1, you're
going to be asleep.

01:15:10.410 --> 01:15:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So I remember saying let
me play a trick on them,

01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey, 10,
9, 8, and I went

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
like this, and the whole
team you heard them

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.670 align:middle line:84%
just starting to get
their stuff together,

01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and about three seconds
later, I went, just kidding.

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
To this day, they all
say that that really

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
brightened the whole attitude
of the operating room.

01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware, and another
second, I was out cold.

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:39.840 align:middle line:84%
They told me afterwards,
that really gave them

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.750 align:middle line:90%
a good outlook.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:42.791 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't like
seeing an 18-year-old kid

01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:47.970 align:middle line:84%
with a deadly uncurable
cancer in his body.

01:15:47.970 --> 01:15:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they did
an amazing operation,

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and at that
time, I said to them,

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:54.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know better.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.200 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.547 align:middle line:84%
I still don't know to
this day what did what.

01:15:58.547 --> 01:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But I do know, I
said to them, listen,

01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:02.060 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to do any of
this chemo or radiation,

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
everybody died with
their chemo, everybody

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:05.150 align:middle line:90%
died withe their radiation.

01:16:05.150 --> 01:16:05.951 align:middle line:90%
And I was strong.

01:16:05.951 --> 01:16:07.741 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was strong as
an ox, even though I

01:16:07.741 --> 01:16:09.120 align:middle line:90%
had the cancer the year before.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I said let me do the
chemo and the radiation,

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
so they gave me the most
poison you can possibly

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
take in the world without
dying, and I almost did die.

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
That's when I stopped
doing the chemo.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.406 align:middle line:84%
Five years later, they found
something in my-- might

01:16:21.406 --> 01:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
have been six years, they
found something in my kidney.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
size of it was 3.5

01:16:29.190 --> 01:16:30.590 align:middle line:90%
when they found it originally.

01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I think I was going in for a
scan every like year or so.

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:36.539 align:middle line:84%
First it was every six months,
then it was every year.

01:16:36.539 --> 01:16:37.955 align:middle line:84%
And then they found
something that

01:16:37.955 --> 01:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
was 3.5 centimeters
in my kidney,

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.174 align:middle line:84%
and they said it parallels
renal cell carcinoma.

01:16:43.174 --> 01:16:44.715 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't want
to get a biopsy,

01:16:44.715 --> 01:16:47.460 align:middle line:84%
because if you get a biopsy
of it, you gotta open it up--

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Spread it.

01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:49.130 align:middle line:90%
Spread the cancer.

01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Spread it.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:51.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean, doctors say that.

01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Do other people say that?

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Biopsies.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Many doctors that we've
interviewed said the same

01:16:55.505 --> 01:16:55.780 align:middle line:90%
thing.

01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.170 align:middle line:84%
The needle aspiration, when
they pull the needle out,

01:16:58.170 --> 01:16:58.970 align:middle line:90%
it can pull--

01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:00.731 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:17:00.731 --> 01:17:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Some doctors believe that,
some doctors actually

01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:03.770 align:middle line:90%
don't believe it.

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:07.110 align:middle line:84%
But so over the years, I could
never get someone that would--

01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
then I started wanting
to get a biopsy.

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted to know
for sure if it was cancer.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.705 align:middle line:84%
Because at this point, is when
I found about the apricot seeds.

01:17:13.705 --> 01:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like the
tumor kept shrinking.

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Every time we went to
the doctors, we saw it--

01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:21.360 align:middle line:84%
the first time I went, it only
went down from 3.5 to 3.2,

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.880 align:middle line:90%
and I was discouraged.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But kidney cancers can
be very slow growing,

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.210 align:middle line:90%
or slow shrinking also.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't let it
discourage me much,

01:17:30.370 --> 01:17:33.350 align:middle line:84%
but every time I went, it was
going down a little bit more,

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:37.827 align:middle line:90%
3.5 2.8, 2.5, 2.0.

01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> All of while you were
eating the apricot seeds?

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:41.201 align:middle line:90%
>> While eating the seeds, yes.

01:17:41.201 --> 01:17:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was like 26 or
27, I was arm wrestling.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to become
New York state champion,

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and I was US champion
at one point.

01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I was the world
champion at one point.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But before I was the world
champion, the show "Extra,"

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.850 align:middle line:84%
they called me up, and they
wanted to do an interview,

01:17:57.850 --> 01:17:58.924 align:middle line:90%
and I said, sure.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll do an interview,
because they

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
saw that this guy is very good
arm wrestler also had cancer,

01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:09.070 align:middle line:90%
and beat the worst cancer.

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's good fodder for TV.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
They came over, we did the
interview, and the next thing

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:18.256 align:middle line:84%
you know, they were calling
me up saying, listen, Jason,

01:18:18.256 --> 01:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
we have hundreds and hundreds
of people calling the show.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
your phone number,

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:23.400 align:middle line:84%
they want to know how they
can get in touch with you,

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.490 align:middle line:90%
talk to you, blah, blah, blah.

01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:26.239 align:middle line:84%
Is it OK if we give
your phone number out?

01:18:26.239 --> 01:18:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I said, sure, get
my phone number out.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
So immediately, people
started calling me,

01:18:30.690 --> 01:18:32.919 align:middle line:84%
and I put together
a business package.

01:18:32.919 --> 01:18:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I found where to get the
seeds, which I currently

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
find like a place that had
find 5 or 10 pounds at a time.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Like the video says,
"World without Cancer,"

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.350 align:middle line:84%
about this whole thing
that's going on--

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:42.331 align:middle line:90%
>> I still remember it.

01:18:42.331 --> 01:18:44.580 align:middle line:84%
It was a videotape that I
got, "World Without Cancer."

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:45.323 align:middle line:90%
>> You wanted it?

01:18:45.323 --> 01:18:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:49.810 align:middle line:84%
All the people, the health
food stores in the past,

01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:51.760 align:middle line:84%
you know the FDA would
break the windows,

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.430 align:middle line:84%
shut the stores down because
they had these seeds.

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:56.782 align:middle line:10%
So to this day, a lot
of health food stores--

01:18:56.782 --> 01:18:58.990 align:middle line:10%
or to that day, when I'm
talking about when I was 36.

01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:00.095 align:middle line:10%
I'm 46 now.

01:19:00.095 --> 01:19:02.470 align:middle line:10%
They didn't carry them, so I
couldn't find them anywhere.

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
If I did find some, it was like
an underground Chinese health

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.020 align:middle line:84%
food in the city that had
like five pounds in the back

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:08.820 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:09.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So anyway, I got the
seeds, and I made some--

01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I got a duplicating machine,
and I put the seeds--

01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:20.279 align:middle line:84%
for like $50, I sold
the seeds and a DVD.

01:19:20.279 --> 01:19:21.695 align:middle line:84%
It was probably
cheaper than that.

01:19:21.695 --> 01:19:24.490 align:middle line:90%
The seeds were only like $15.

01:19:24.490 --> 01:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I put it together, and
I got a credit card account,

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and threw up a quick web
site, and I just started

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:33.430 align:middle line:90%
selling tons of these things.

01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell
these persons, now,

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
listen, I don't want to
be-- if this isn't true,

01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be touting
something that's not true.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Call me back if there's
any success stories.

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I started getting calls
immediately of people saying,

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.680 align:middle line:84%
listen, I had a
tumor on my skin.

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.570 align:middle line:90%
It shrunk down.

01:19:49.570 --> 01:19:51.486 align:middle line:84%
Or I had a tumor on my
arm, and it got bigger.

01:19:51.486 --> 01:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
It swelled up and
then it shrunk down.

01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:55.441 align:middle line:90%
It started itching.

01:19:55.441 --> 01:19:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I got every story in the book,
and I asked the people, look,

01:19:57.940 --> 01:19:59.770 align:middle line:84%
can I put your phone
number at the website?

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:01.603 align:middle line:84%
Can I put your email
address on the website,

01:20:01.603 --> 01:20:03.250 align:middle line:84%
because people
don't believe this.

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:05.540 align:middle line:90%
So they said, OK.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So the FTC sends me a letter,
and they spelled my name wrong.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.587 align:middle line:84%
So I should have stuck with
them, but I said, listen,

01:20:12.587 --> 01:20:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know who
you're talking about.

01:20:14.170 --> 01:20:16.410 align:middle line:90%
There's no name at this address.

01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:20.987 align:middle line:84%
So we went back and forth, and
they sent the letter saying,

01:20:20.987 --> 01:20:22.986 align:middle line:84%
you got proof of this
happening, proof about it?

01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Show me the proof.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So saying that you're making
unapproved claims for curing?

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> When they kicked
it over to the FDA,

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and the FDA started saying
that, so at that point,

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
they had my right
name, right address.

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I just had a
lawyer, Mr. Dilling,

01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if he's
alive to this this day,

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
but Mr. Dilling
was in the middle

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of this fight 40 years ago when
this whole thing was going on.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, listen, we just
have to change the labeling,

01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:55.612 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, which I did, and
then the FDA said, no good.

01:20:55.612 --> 01:20:56.820 align:middle line:90%
And then we changed it again.

01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:58.880 align:middle line:84%
The FDA kept saying no
good, no good, no good.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.160 align:middle line:84%
To everything we did,
they kept saying no good.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.212 align:middle line:84%
Then I realized
that there's nothing

01:21:03.212 --> 01:21:04.420 align:middle line:90%
we can do to make this right.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a stacked deck.

01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:09.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It sure was, and that's when
they got a temporary injunction

01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:14.260 align:middle line:84%
against me, and the
injunction was not to sell--

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:18.865 align:middle line:84%
the whole crux of it was, they
said you can't sell seeds--

01:21:18.865 --> 01:21:21.610 align:middle line:84%
At first, they said you
can't sell them as a cure.

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.870 align:middle line:84%
You can't sell them
according to the FDA law.

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Which only means I can't
sell them as a cure.

01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Doesn't mean I
can't sell them period.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Because then I can't
own a grocery store.

01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't say that
they cure anything.

01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:34.840 align:middle line:84%
In the end of them
adjusting and marking things

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
out and redacting things
from the injunction,

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
it read a lot more to say,
you can't sell seeds period.

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:47.327 align:middle line:84%
This is when I said, you can't
tell me I can't sell seeds.

01:21:47.327 --> 01:21:48.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell me I
can't sell apples,

01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:50.660 align:middle line:84%
because that has the
same thing in it.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And they stuck to that, and the
judge, it was a stacked trial.

01:21:56.690 --> 01:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they had a permanent
injunction against me,

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.980 align:middle line:90%
and they said, I violated both.

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But I was saying, listen, you've
got to prove that I sold them

01:22:06.810 --> 01:22:08.649 align:middle line:90%
as a cure, which I stopped.

01:22:08.649 --> 01:22:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do that anymore.

01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:11.559 align:middle line:90%
I told people--

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I gave the FDA
warning at the bottom,

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and I also told people it
was third party information.

01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I just never told people
it's going to cure you.

01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I would never say that to
people, even if it does.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:27.960 align:middle line:90%
So I had a trial basically.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.700 align:middle line:84%
During the initial
hearing, I left.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I actually was on my way
with a bunch of friends,

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
we were all dressed
up, and I just--

01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:35.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not kidding.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.210 align:middle line:90%
This sounds weird.

01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:38.460 align:middle line:90%
A flock of birds--

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.800 align:middle line:84%
like I was headed this
way, a flock of birds

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.710 align:middle line:84%
came like right over
the car going this way.

01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm sorry, I'm
not superstitious like that,

01:22:47.370 --> 01:22:49.147 align:middle line:90%
but I was like, I am not going.

01:22:49.147 --> 01:22:50.730 align:middle line:84%
I was like, this has
got to be a sign.

01:22:50.730 --> 01:22:51.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going.

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I left.

01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.801 align:middle line:84%
I went to my other
pal for three months.

01:22:54.801 --> 01:22:57.300 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for me, and
I was talking to the marshals,

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.460 align:middle line:90%
and finally, I turned myself in.

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:03.179 align:middle line:84%
And it was a million
dollar bail they gave me.

01:23:03.179 --> 01:23:04.053 align:middle line:90%
>> A million dollars?

01:23:04.053 --> 01:23:04.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:23:04.853 --> 01:23:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>> $883,000.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.310 align:middle line:90%
I almost won the trial.

01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:10.949 align:middle line:84%
I actually was pro-se,
where my lawyer

01:23:10.949 --> 01:23:12.990 align:middle line:84%
who was telling me, oh,
I'll get you eight years.

01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:15.210 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean, you'll
get me eight years?

01:23:15.210 --> 01:23:16.392 align:middle line:90%
This is contempt of court.

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Contempt of court is like
a six month thing the most,

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.950 align:middle line:90%
if you're guilty.

01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:22.080 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even guilty
and they're saying.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So it was a trial, but there
was no statutory maximum

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.210 align:middle line:90%
and no middle.

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:29.177 align:middle line:90%
So it was a very--

01:23:29.177 --> 01:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, they were saying
you could get 20 years,

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and I said, listen, if
I'm going to go to prison.

01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:36.480 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be I'm
doing my own trial then.

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.839 align:middle line:84%
So I kicked them
out, and the judge

01:23:38.839 --> 01:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't let them
completely get off.

01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:42.730 align:middle line:84%
the judge made them
sit at the table.

01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget
the one question

01:23:44.210 --> 01:23:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I asked that the lawyer
jumped up on my side,

01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and said, don't
ask that question.

01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:50.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was going to ask--

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:57.630 align:middle line:84%
the FDA agent was on the witness
stand, and I was redirecting,

01:23:57.630 --> 01:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing my cross
examination, excuse me.

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And the question was, did you
have like 40 or 50 complaints

01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:06.900 align:middle line:90%
about me?

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And the lawyer got
up, and said, hold on.

01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Time out.

01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:12.115 align:middle line:84%
We're talking, don't
ask that question.

01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I said, listen, I'm asking this
question because I was going

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:17.640 align:middle line:84%
to come down to the end
saying, did you ever get

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.074 align:middle line:90%
a complaint against me?

01:24:19.074 --> 01:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
So I made him sit
down, and I said

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
did you have 30
or 40 complaints?

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:22.540 align:middle line:90%
He said, no.

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Did you have 20 to 30?

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Did you have 10?

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Did you have 5?

01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever have 1 complaint
about me with the seeds

01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:32.010 align:middle line:90%
about me defrauding people?

01:24:32.010 --> 01:24:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And he had to say no, and
i have those transcripts

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:36.770 align:middle line:90%
at the website actually.

01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:40.900 align:middle line:84%
We had him actually admit
no, so why was I on trial?

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:41.700 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Nobody was injured.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:45.195 align:middle line:84%
There has to be an injured
party for there to be a trial.

01:24:45.195 --> 01:24:47.140 align:middle line:84%
This shouldn't even
be a civil thing.

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it was a
big kangaroo court.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.690 align:middle line:90%
It was a big farce.

01:24:51.690 --> 01:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
At that point, he said right
away, you're in contempt.

01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:58.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to show me
why you should not

01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:00.840 align:middle line:84%
be held in contempt by the
end of this day or else

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:03.060 align:middle line:84%
they were going to detain
me anyway that day.

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.492 align:middle line:90%
I was guilty that day.

01:25:06.492 --> 01:25:07.360 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.160 align:middle line:90%
They held me from that day.

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come out for
five years from that day.

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Five years?

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Five years.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:12.700 align:middle line:90%
4 years, 11 months.

01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> County jail?

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.110 align:middle line:90%
Where'd you go?

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.925 align:middle line:90%
>> I went to NBC, I think.

01:25:16.925 --> 01:25:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It was not county,
this was federal.

01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Federal prison?

01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh,yeah.

01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So you did five years,
and you then you got it.

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Was it 2008 you
got out of prison?

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.270 align:middle line:90%
>> 2008.

01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:26.175 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:25:26.175 --> 01:25:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Jason, I want to thank
you for sharing your story with

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.090 align:middle line:84%
us tonight, and I just want
to thank you personally.

01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
This mini series, "The
Truth About Cancer,"

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.170 align:middle line:84%
would not be happening
it wasn't for you.

01:25:37.170 --> 01:25:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Because you were
the first person

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
that woke me up to natural
cancer treatments back in 1996.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.110 align:middle line:90%
A long time ago.

01:25:47.110 --> 01:25:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Six?

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> 18 years ago.

01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:50.080 align:middle line:90%
>> 1996 it was?

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.235 align:middle line:90%
>> It was 1996 that I saw--

01:25:51.235 --> 01:25:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It started in '94.

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I think in '94 is maybe
when you filmed the show.

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.700 align:middle line:84%
'96 was when my dad
died, and that's

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:57.846 align:middle line:90%
when I first saw the video.

01:25:57.846 --> 01:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
thank you personally,

01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:02.297 align:middle line:84%
and this wouldn't have
even happened without you.

01:26:02.297 --> 01:26:03.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody mentions you.

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So many people that called up
my company, they all say, Ty.

01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wish there
was a way I could--

01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I owe you a lot too,
because a lot of people--

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
they owe you a lot too, because
a lot of people read your book.

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:16.150 align:middle line:84%
The way you marketed it,
a lot of people read it,

01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:18.120 align:middle line:90%
and they got better.

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.120 align:middle line:90%
They got better.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.031 align:middle line:84%
They lived an extra 5, 10
years, which all counts.

01:26:22.031 --> 01:26:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, with quality of life.

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But, hey, we're all
in the same fight.

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We're all here to
spread the truth

01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:27.488 align:middle line:84%
and to spread
knowledge about this,

01:26:27.488 --> 01:26:29.290 align:middle line:84%
so it's my honor to
interview tonight, man.

01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, bro.

01:26:30.090 --> 01:26:32.298 align:middle line:84%
>> And we'll arm wrestle in
a second, but off camera.

01:26:32.298 --> 01:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, you know, I
don't know about you,

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
but I'm a little bit happy
and I'm sad at the same time.

01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to miss
this every night,

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:44.790 align:middle line:84%
but I'm happy that
we've been able to share

01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:45.910 align:middle line:90%
this information with you.

01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And we've been able to
share these cancer survivor

01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:49.772 align:middle line:84%
and thriver
testimonials with you.

01:26:49.772 --> 01:26:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, one of the things
that's interesting about this

01:26:52.230 --> 01:26:54.180 align:middle line:84%
is that you heard
in the last episode

01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.520 align:middle line:84%
about the medical doctors
that treated their own cancer,

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.640 align:middle line:84%
but what we heard tonight are
actual cancer patients that

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.690 align:middle line:90%
aren't doctors.

01:27:00.690 --> 01:27:02.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't have that
medical education.

01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But they were
diagnosed with cancer,

01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:07.046 align:middle line:84%
and then, potentially they
went in for treatment,

01:27:07.046 --> 01:27:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and the oncologist said you've
got to do chemo, radiation

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and surgery and just something
about that didn't resonate

01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
with them, and they listened
to that inner voice that said,

01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:16.830 align:middle line:90%
this is not the way for me.

01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:18.564 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really
encouraging to me.

01:27:18.564 --> 01:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
impressive to me

01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that these people that are
not doctors, that probably

01:27:22.290 --> 01:27:24.780 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of pressure
from family and friends

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
to go the traditional route
of chemo, radiation, surgery,

01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:28.807 align:middle line:84%
but they opted for
something else.

01:27:28.807 --> 01:27:30.390 align:middle line:84%
That's just impressive
to me that they

01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
had that intestinal
fortitude to do that,

01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and to step outside the box, and
to do what they felt was right.

01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:38.763 align:middle line:84%
And they're alive today, so that
you could hear their stories.

01:27:38.763 --> 01:27:39.700 align:middle line:90%
So what a great show.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.033 align:middle line:90%
It's been a great series, folks.

01:27:41.033 --> 01:27:42.772 align:middle line:84%
I really am so
thankful for all of you

01:27:42.772 --> 01:27:44.730 align:middle line:84%
out there that have been
watching and listening

01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:46.250 align:middle line:90%
and supporting our cause.

01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:47.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, over the
last 11 days, we've

01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:51.810 align:middle line:84%
learned about the history of
the American Medical Association

01:27:51.810 --> 01:27:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and the suppressed treatments,
and genetically modified foods,

01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and toxins in vaccines, all
these things that compromise

01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:59.820 align:middle line:84%
our immune system,
which is our first line

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.145 align:middle line:90%
of defense against disease.

01:28:01.145 --> 01:28:02.520 align:middle line:84%
We've learned
about foods that we

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.520 align:middle line:84%
can eat to fortify that
immune system, and which

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.750 align:middle line:84%
foods to stay away from,
and which foods to eat.

01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:07.920 align:middle line:84%
We've learned about
the treatments

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.836 align:middle line:84%
for cancer, the natural
treatments for cancer.

01:28:09.836 --> 01:28:11.972 align:middle line:84%
We've learned about how
to detoxify the body.

01:28:11.972 --> 01:28:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I tell you what, at
this point, if you've

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
been paying attention
over the last 11 days,

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:17.790 align:middle line:84%
you probably got
a better education

01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:20.900 align:middle line:84%
on how your body works,
how to achieve true health,

01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:22.780 align:middle line:84%
than 99% of the
people out there,

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:24.826 align:middle line:84%
including a lot of
medical doctors.

01:28:24.826 --> 01:28:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for tuning
in to the "The Quest,

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:27.990 align:middle line:90%
The Cure Continues."

01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:30.060 align:middle line:84%
I really hope that
you've benefited from it.

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I hope that you've shared it
with your friends and family,

01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that you live a
healthy and long life because

01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:34.860 align:middle line:90%
of it.

01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It's been our privilege to
spend this time with you

01:28:37.170 --> 01:28:40.000 align:middle line:84%
over these last couple of weeks,
and we wish you all the best.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.104 align:middle line:84%
May god bless each
and every one of you.

01:28:45.492 --> 01:28:52.760 align:middle line:90%


01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> The beautiful thing is
when they're at the point,

01:28:56.250 --> 01:28:59.800 align:middle line:84%
they're losing their life,
and they turn around,

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:03.480 align:middle line:84%
they get better, and all of
a sudden they either have

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:08.200 align:middle line:84%
their life back, or they even
have a better life afterwards.

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.000 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.330 align:middle line:84%
This whole natural medicine
thing is pretty cool.

01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:15.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's like being the
coach of the winning team,

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.162 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:29:17.162 --> 01:29:19.590 align:middle line:90%
They won the championship.

01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:21.620 align:middle line:90%
That's what it feels like.

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's really--

01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how else
to describe that.

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:27.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's what that feels like.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.560 align:middle line:90%


01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.210 align:middle line:90%
You won.

01:29:32.210 --> 01:29:36.240 align:middle line:84%
They won, but through
them, you won, you know?

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:37.040 align:middle line:90%
You were the coach.

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.000 align:middle line:90%
The team won.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.190 align:middle line:90%


01:29:42.190 --> 01:29:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I have patients that were given
as little as six weeks left.

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Hospice had been called in.

01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:55.610 align:middle line:84%
They were getting all
their affairs in order.

01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Really bad situations,
and they have responded,

01:29:59.390 --> 01:30:01.100 align:middle line:90%
have turned around.

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Many of these cases, here
we are 10 years later,

01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:07.870 align:middle line:90%
and they've won.

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is a thing in
the past for them.

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:11.760 align:middle line:90%
They're better.

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.810 align:middle line:90%
They've maintained their health.

01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:16.180 align:middle line:90%
They're in good health.

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:19.210 align:middle line:84%
They keep falling the
healthy principles

01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that they have to follow
in order to be healthy,

01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and some of these people
are starting families.

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of these people
are able to spend time

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.890 align:middle line:90%
with their grandchildren.

01:30:32.890 --> 01:30:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Other people are
rebirthed their businesses

01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and they're flourishing,
and they're doing very well.

01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And for me, every
one of them, it's

01:30:47.410 --> 01:30:49.970 align:middle line:84%
like my team won
the championship.

01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:53.820 align:middle line:90%


01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:56.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the most awesome,
awesome, awesome feeling

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:00.010 align:middle line:84%
when somebody and
you actually get

01:31:00.010 --> 01:31:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to participate and be
the guide to help someone

01:31:03.850 --> 01:31:07.470 align:middle line:84%
go from a death
sentence to living

01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:middle line:84%
a whole life, a healthy
life, a good life.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.226 align:middle line:90%


01:31:14.226 --> 01:31:16.350 align:middle line:84%
I can't think of anything
more rewarding that that.

01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:18.860 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Humanly speaking, you
look at this and think,

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:23.330 align:middle line:90%
what is the hope in this?

01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:24.550 align:middle line:90%
You've lost so many people.

01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:26.810 align:middle line:10%
Not only the mother
and the father

01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:29.720 align:middle line:10%
and all these grandparents,
cousin, uncle, all these people

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.330 align:middle line:10%
in a pretty short span of time.

01:31:32.330 --> 01:31:34.700 align:middle line:10%
Six months after we were
married, one after the other,

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.170 align:middle line:10%
what is the hope?

01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:38.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, the first one
was Ty's father,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.510 align:middle line:10%
and when he was in the
hospital, he never complained.

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:42.770 align:middle line:90%
He knew where his hope was.

01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:45.920 align:middle line:84%
He knew where he was going,
and he was a good man.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.410 align:middle line:84%
A good man, just like
when you look at Ty,

01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:49.910 align:middle line:90%
that's who his father was.

01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:52.190 align:middle line:90%
Just a good, good man.

01:31:52.190 --> 01:31:56.060 align:middle line:10%
Well, God was really working
in my heart as well as

01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:01.310 align:middle line:10%
Ty's during the time that his
father was ill, showing us

01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:04.940 align:middle line:10%
that the things that
we were pursuing,

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:09.180 align:middle line:10%
that so many people in the
world pursue, are transient.

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:11.000 align:middle line:90%
They're temporary.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.680 align:middle line:90%
And one day, they'll be gone.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:20.300 align:middle line:10%
Just gone, and we saw that
Ty's father was living for what

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:23.150 align:middle line:10%
really mattered, for eternity.

01:32:23.150 --> 01:32:24.680 align:middle line:10%
And I was sharing these things.

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:26.930 align:middle line:10%
There was so much more, but
I was sharing these things

01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:28.340 align:middle line:10%
with Ty's father.

01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:34.540 align:middle line:10%
He's a big, tall, strong
man, beautiful smile.

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.880 align:middle line:84%
We're walking
around the hospital,

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.150 align:middle line:84%
he's getting his exercise
hooked up to all these machines.

01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and he looks down at
me after I tell him

01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:45.370 align:middle line:84%
how God is really
using him in my life

01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:47.910 align:middle line:90%
and in my heart for good.

01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:51.000 align:middle line:10%
And he just smiled that
brilliant smile he has,

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.530 align:middle line:10%
that you see In Ty, and said,
if that's all that God does

01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:59.178 align:middle line:10%
is work in your
heart with my cancer,

01:32:59.178 --> 01:33:03.660 align:middle line:10%
then it's all worth it for you.

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:08.080 align:middle line:10%
If he could only see
today all of the lives

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.390 align:middle line:10%
that have been spared,
all of the souls

01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:13.510 align:middle line:10%
that are still here
enjoying their families,

01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:16.800 align:middle line:10%
and their families
enjoying them,

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.490 align:middle line:10%
he just couldn't believe it.

01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he knows in heaven.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:22.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:24.617 align:middle line:10%
But he said it was
worth it for me,

01:33:24.617 --> 01:33:27.200 align:middle line:10%
and look at all the lives that
we have been able to touch just

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.420 align:middle line:10%
simply by bringing
this information

01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:30.480 align:middle line:10%
into the mainstream.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.750 align:middle line:10%
It's criminal that
this information has

01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:38.630 align:middle line:10%
been hidden from the
mainstream media,

01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:43.040 align:middle line:10%
the information flow
has been blocked.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:47.060 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why we feel
it is a matter of life

01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:48.620 align:middle line:10%
and death, this message.

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:52.550 align:middle line:84%
The truth about cancer
has got to be known.

01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:56.360 align:middle line:84%
There are people out
there today that are alive

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.735 align:middle line:84%
and cancer free because
of this information.

01:33:58.735 --> 01:34:00.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's a joy.

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:05.570 align:middle line:10%
It's the purpose for which God
placed us here on this Earth,

01:34:05.570 --> 01:34:09.900 align:middle line:10%
and Ty's parents, those precious
souls, we'll see them again.

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:10.700 align:middle line:10%
We know that.

01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:13.034 align:middle line:90%


01:34:13.034 --> 01:34:14.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of other
families enjoying

01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.400 align:middle line:84%
their family members, their
fathers or their mothers,

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.680 align:middle line:90%
because of this information.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So when we hear about
cancers, hear the word cancer,

01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:23.040 align:middle line:90%
that's what we think.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.360 align:middle line:90%
We just live to help people.

01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:28.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just a
passion that we both have,

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's a joy.

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:32.960 align:middle line:84%
We desire to help
others not to have

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.930 align:middle line:84%
to suffer as we saw
his father suffer,

01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and as we had to suffer
when we said goodbye.

01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:43.172 align:middle line:84%
That was very difficult, and
our lives were forever changed.

01:34:43.172 --> 01:34:47.093 align:middle line:10%
>> Why is that?

01:34:47.093 --> 01:34:49.342 align:middle line:10%
>> Because they were so
loving, and these children are

01:34:49.342 --> 01:34:50.142 align:middle line:10%
so sweet.

01:34:50.142 --> 01:34:57.150 align:middle line:90%


01:34:57.150 --> 01:35:00.351 align:middle line:10%
We take turns sometimes we say,
oh, if they we're only here.

01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:02.850 align:middle line:84%
If they we're only here, they
would be beating down our door

01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:03.891 align:middle line:90%
to get to these children.

01:35:03.891 --> 01:35:08.980 align:middle line:90%


01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:11.650 align:middle line:10%
That's still difficult.
We still both

01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:15.068 align:middle line:10%
have a difficult time with that.

01:35:15.068 --> 01:35:20.950 align:middle line:10%
And we have to remind each
other that there is purpose.

01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:25.300 align:middle line:10%
There is a reason, and we
get to tell the children

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.390 align:middle line:10%
the wonderful stories
that I'm telling you now

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:34.410 align:middle line:10%
about their amazing
grandparents.

01:35:34.410 --> 01:35:36.512 align:middle line:10%
And they miss them.

01:35:36.512 --> 01:35:38.220 align:middle line:10%
They say all the time
how they miss them,

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:40.270 align:middle line:10%
as if they know them.

01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:43.662 align:middle line:10%
So that is a consolation
to be able to give them

01:35:43.662 --> 01:35:45.120 align:middle line:10%
these beautiful
stories, to have it

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:51.820 align:middle line:10%
written in a book and many
articles and interviews.

01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
They do have a connection,
so that's a consolation.

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a
consolation that others

01:35:57.510 --> 01:36:01.440 align:middle line:90%
get to have grandparents.

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.620 align:middle line:90%
That's a blessing.

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:07.950 align:middle line:10%
You know not having our parents,
grandparents for our children,

01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:09.540 align:middle line:10%
and we get into moments.

01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Like today, the amazing filming,
the beautiful pictures they

01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:17.680 align:middle line:84%
you got of Ty with the children
in our family, of course,

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:21.930 align:middle line:84%
we think, wow, if Grammy
could only see this.

01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Ty's parents.

01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:26.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not here, and who knows
what they can see in heaven.

01:36:26.610 --> 01:36:27.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:30.630 align:middle line:84%
We like to think that there
may be some glimpses, something

01:36:30.630 --> 01:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that-- they'll probably
know more than we do.

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.410 align:middle line:10%
But we don't know.

01:36:34.410 --> 01:36:37.410 align:middle line:10%
We don't have that
physical connection,

01:36:37.410 --> 01:36:39.160 align:middle line:10%
but, yes, there are
families out there

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.060 align:middle line:10%
that because of this
information have

01:36:42.060 --> 01:36:45.500 align:middle line:10%
been able to see their
grandchildren grow up,

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.650 align:middle line:10%
or will be able to see
their grandchildren grow up,

01:36:47.650 --> 01:36:51.640 align:middle line:10%
or their children,
or their parents,

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:53.530 align:middle line:10%
whatever the case may be.

01:36:53.530 --> 01:36:55.666 align:middle line:84%
For us, it was parents
and grandparents.

01:36:55.666 --> 01:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
"The Quest for
the Cure," and now

01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.370 align:middle line:84%
of "The Cure for the Cure
Continues," is reaching so

01:37:00.370 --> 01:37:01.330 align:middle line:90%
many people.

01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So many people are able to
wake up to a beautiful truth

01:37:04.210 --> 01:37:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that cancer does not have
to be a death sentence.

01:37:07.210 --> 01:37:10.390 align:middle line:90%
So all of our suffering--

01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's worth it.

01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Dad told me.

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:31.288 align:middle line:90%
