00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back, everyone,
to "The Quest for the Cures

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Continues."

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
I hope you enjoyed
last night's episode,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.713 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that you came away
empowered with information

00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and also convinced that
not everything that we hear

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.751 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I hope that you understand now
that we have been potentially

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:84%
lied to about certain things,
and certain treatments

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:84%
and certain information
has potentially

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.634 align:middle line:90%
been withheld from you.

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:47.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's
pretty much without dispute

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:84%
is that the immune
system plays a big role

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.857 align:middle line:90%
in the prevention of disease.

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
the immune system

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is really your first line of
defense against pathogens,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.830 align:middle line:84%
against the bad guys that come
in and try to invade your body

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.955 align:middle line:90%
and make you sick.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered
why, let's say, you've

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
got some kiddos and
they're in school,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.820 align:middle line:84%
and somebody comes to
school in their class

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:90%
and they're sick with the flu.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, maybe half
the class is out with the flu,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.390 align:middle line:84%
but the other half is at
school and they never get sick.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.782 align:middle line:90%
What was the difference?

00:01:15.782 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
What was the difference
between those children?

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Were they exposed to
different flu bugs?

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.570 align:middle line:84%
They're exposed to
the same flu bug,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
but the kids that
didn't get sick

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
had an immune system
that was functioning

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.710 align:middle line:90%
the way it should have been.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And those that got sick, for
some reason, that immune system

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.402 align:middle line:90%
was compromised.

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Tonight's going to be
a powerful episode.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.276 align:middle line:84%
You are going to understand
the immune system better

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:84%
than 99% of the people
out there after you

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.930 align:middle line:90%
listen to this information.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to teach you
what the immune system is,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
what it does, and
what substances

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.525 align:middle line:84%
might compromise that immune
system and make you sick.

00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I hope you enjoy
the information,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and I hope you learn
from the information

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
share with you tonight.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.542 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the show.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Our first guest tonight
is Dr. Rashid Buttar.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.190 align:middle line:84%
He's a friend of
mine, and he practices

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.961 align:middle line:90%
medicine in North Carolina.

00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
He's got some valuable insight
into the immune system,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:84%
but I think this first
quote from Dr. Buttar

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.416 align:middle line:90%
is going to blow your socks off.

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So cancer,
first and foremost,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is a problem with
the immune system.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.762 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have cancer if you
have an intact immune system.

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
If you have cancer, you don't
have an intact immune system.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.178 align:middle line:84%
If people say, oh no, my
immune system is fine,

00:02:23.178 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:90%
then you can't have cancer.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:10%
You can't have two, OK?

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Those two things
can't live together.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
If it's an immune system
that's compromised,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.609 align:middle line:90%
you could have cancer.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have a cancer, you
have to, by definition,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.224 align:middle line:84%
have a compromised
immune system.

00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I was privileged to speak
at the Cancer Control Society

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Convention in August,
2014, in Los Angeles.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And while I was there,
I was able to interview

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
three medical doctors
about this same issue--

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.900 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a listen.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.810 align:middle line:10%
>> But the first thing I do
when I get a new patient is,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:10%
one of the things that I
do is, I begin to unimpede

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:10%
their immune system.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:10%
Because every cancer
patient, their immune system

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:10%
has missed the cancer.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:10%
So it has missed it.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:10%
And, so, you have to
unimpede their immune system,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:10%
and then you have to
stimulate it back into action.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Because, at the end
of the day, they

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
will not survive if their
immune system is not

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:90%
really stimulated.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the many fallacies
of standard cancer care

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.592 align:middle line:84%
is that they just want
to kill cancer cells.

00:03:31.592 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's nice, but
why did you get cancer?

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:90%
What was the cause?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>> They never asked
that question.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:10%
I tell my patients--

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:10%
I encourage them to continue
to see their oncologist

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:10%
to give them feedback so
that as they get well,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.367 align:middle line:10%
they will have a witness borne
to them that other things work.

00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, they know good and
well that what they're doing

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:90%
is not working.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.060 align:middle line:10%
But I say two things
that you'll be amazed at.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:10%
They'll never ask what caused
this and deal with that

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:10%
or try to deal
with it in any way.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just-- let's
kill cancer cells.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
And then number two,
as you get well,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.579 align:middle line:84%
they will never
ask you, what did

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
you do, because they
don't want that knowledge,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
because then
they're responsible.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's two things that
the doctors will never

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
ask the patient
who is getting well

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:84%
from taking herbals
or nutritionals

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
or alternative
medical treatment.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.599 align:middle line:84%
But you have to unimpede
the immune system.

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
stimulate it back in action.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Because, at the end of the
day, without your immune system

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.845 align:middle line:90%
working, you will not live.

00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:10%
>> With all our patients,
whether it's cancer or any kind

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:10%
of chronic disease, it's always
about lowering inflammation

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.500 align:middle line:10%
and improving and increasing
immune system response.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.320 align:middle line:10%
Because your immune system
has to fight, fix, and repair

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.660 align:middle line:10%
against anything, right?

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.024 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just suppression,
it's about strengthening.

00:05:01.024 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But the nice thing about
the natural therapies

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
is that it turns on and
off genes, accordingly.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just turning
off genes always,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.159 align:middle line:84%
there's also up regulation
and down regulation.

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.699 align:middle line:84%
So, curcumin, I mentioned when
I showed you that slide today,

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and it shows certain
genes are now turned on,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
that our body already has this
natural mechanism of fighting

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:90%
cancer, for example.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.406 align:middle line:84%
And we want to keep
stimulating that.

00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens is,
as we get older,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
through other things of
environment, lifestyle, stress,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.270 align:middle line:84%
diet, those genes and
those transcription factors

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.232 align:middle line:90%
and those proteins turn off.

00:05:30.232 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So we are all born
with it, we just

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.937 align:middle line:90%
want to keep stimulating it.

00:05:32.937 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And the nice thing is that
these natural therapies

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.629 align:middle line:84%
can turn on the things that we
want to turn on and turn off

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:90%
the things we want to turn off.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.503 align:middle line:84%
>> The immune system
and inflammation,

00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:90%
how are they related to cancer?

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well-- It would be
logical to argue that,

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
in an intact immune system,
there would be no room

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:90%
for cancer.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.702 align:middle line:10%
And the immune system, which is
kind of an indefinable entity,

00:06:05.702 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:10%
it's not like it's right over
here or it's right over here.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the immune system,
it wraps around the GI tract.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a nebulous, almost
a vaporous process.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to say, in anatomy
and physiology and dissection,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:90%
here is the immune system.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, if
it's functioning well,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
its job is to enhance health
and promote detoxification

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And inflammation is one
of the main instruments

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
that the immune system
uses to regulate health.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
we find in cancer,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.150 align:middle line:84%
which is quite interesting,
is that, typically,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
the guy that says, I haven't
been sick a day in my life,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, we have to
worry about cancer here.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the kid that
gets a lot of fevers

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and has an immune system
which is always up and running

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and not apathetic,
that's a good sign.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to get a
good prognosis for health,

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
it's someone who's been
able to have a challenge,

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
up-regulate the immune
system, and have a big fever,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.980 align:middle line:84%
burn through it,
and come out better.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Very similar to something
that Dr. Rashid Buttar told me.

00:07:12.527 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:84%
He said, the people
that I worry about

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.460 align:middle line:84%
are the people that
have never gotten sick.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Because of the
same exact reason.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.068 align:middle line:84%
These are principles
that go back--

00:07:20.068 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd like to say
I invented them all,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
but they were long before
any of us were alive.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
This is what people's
grandmothers know.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Which is why, in the old
days, when kids had the mumps,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.965 align:middle line:90%
you'd go have mumps parties.

00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the mumps parties.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Chickenpox parties.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I was able to interview Dr.
David Brownstein in Detroit,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Michigan, about this topic.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's hear what he has to say.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I assume you drove a car out
to my house today to do this

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.000 align:middle line:90%
interview.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
our horses broke down.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:90%
So, yes we did.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:10%
>> So I also assume that
when you take that car back

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:10%
to the airport, you're going
to put gas in that car.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:10%
The car needs a certain kind
of gas to run optimally.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.382 align:middle line:90%
And, let's say a gas station--

00:07:57.382 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:84%
maybe your own personal car
would be a better analogy

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:84%
for this-- but if there was
a gas station that said $0.10

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.814 align:middle line:84%
a gallon in gas, and you pull
up there and you say, hey,

00:08:04.814 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do a deal here.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.856 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cost me
less to fill up my car.

00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:09.438 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at it, and it's mud.

00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to put that
mud in your gas tank?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
No, because you know it's
going to wreck your car.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, I say the same thing.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We need to put the
right fuel in our bodies

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
so our immune system
functions optimally.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:10%
We have a great design in the
human body to fight infection,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:10%
to stay healthy into old
age, to keep brain function

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:10%
into old age.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we treat the body
right, the immune system

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:90%
can work just fine.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.866 align:middle line:84%
And treating that body right
is doing the basics like what

00:08:34.866 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about--

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.539 align:middle line:84%
supplying it with
the right nutrients,

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
maintaining hydration,
keeping iodine levels up,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining adequate
amounts of salt intake.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:10%
And the immune system
can do its job,

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:10%
surveil for foreign
substances and foreign bodies

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:10%
and get rid of that, and
it can keep cancer at bay.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:84%
When the immune
system gets disrupted,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that's when bad
things start happening to us.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.068 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting to get
the full picture here.

00:08:59.068 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:84%
We just heard from
five medical doctors

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
that all talked about
the fact that cancer

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
is a result of a
compromised immune system.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
When I visited Las Vegas, I
interviewed Dr. Keith Scott

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Mumby who had some
valuable information

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.670 align:middle line:84%
to share about
the immune system.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Talk about white blood
cells, the immune system,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and inflammation, as it
all relates to cancer.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, a part
of the question, Ty, is--

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
What is the basic
model for cancer?

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
There's the stem cell model and
the metabolic model and so on.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
But, certainly, at the core,
if not the cause, many people,

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm one of them, see
cancer as basically a disease

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.181 align:middle line:90%
of the immune system.

00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:41.556 align:middle line:84%
Especially in our
modern world, I

00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:42.972 align:middle line:84%
don't think there's
any way you're

00:09:42.972 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
going to stop cells firing off
and going wrong and turning

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:90%
into rogue cells.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:90%
There's just too many toxins.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.845 align:middle line:84%
But a good immune system will
pick them up very quickly

00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:90%
and eliminate them.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So in a very strong
sense, cancer

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.381 align:middle line:84%
is a disease of
the immune system.

00:09:57.381 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So you want to do
everything in your power

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.221 align:middle line:90%
to help the immune system.

00:10:00.221 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:10%
That means, you
know, the right kind

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:10%
of nutrients that will help it.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:10%
It also means
removing the stresses

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:10%
that would stop it working.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
They're all
inflammatory in nature.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned food,
inflammatory foods,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.580 align:middle line:84%
but there's chemicals,
pesticides, pollutants,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:84%
you know, bisfenol, all of these
things, loads of those too.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And then don't forget
heavy metal toxicity.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Mercury and lead
and these things

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
not only have their
poisonous parts,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.780 align:middle line:84%
but they're highly
inflammatory too.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to
unburden the immune system.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
say that emotions

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:90%
can be pretty inflammatory too.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.572 align:middle line:84%
The immune system gets burdened
even if a person is upset, sad,

00:10:40.572 --> 00:10:41.530 align:middle line:90%
depressed, or whatever.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would like a minute to
talk about that with cancer.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a very
crucial element in cancer.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But, really, anything--
that's what I'm saying--

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.460 align:middle line:84%
anything that's inflammatory
is bad for cancer.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, we can get
a good handle on it.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:84%
There are ways, like you
can take your antioxidants,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
you phytonutrients, omega 3s
are brilliant anti-inflammatory.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But removing the triggers,
like the inflammatory foods

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and heavy metals, is a
better strategy anyway.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
we should all do.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.795 align:middle line:84%
And it's back to my saying,
any good health measure

00:11:11.795 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:90%
is an anti-cancer measure.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that quote.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.427 align:middle line:84%
"Any good health measure
is an anti-cancer measure."

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a fully
functioning immune system,

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.485 align:middle line:90%
you cannot have cancer.

00:11:21.485 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's one of
the main things that

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.737 align:middle line:84%
compromises the immune system
other than the conventional

00:11:25.737 --> 00:11:27.070 align:middle line:90%
treatments, chemo and radiation?

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Which, yes, they do
compromise the immune system.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.650 align:middle line:84%
They devastate
the immune system.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But what's one other
thing, a common thing

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that people eat on
an everyday basis?

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Sugar.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to nutritionist
KC Craichy discuss

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.510 align:middle line:90%
this very important subject.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So sugar, we talk about
it, it's a big problem.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's a big problem.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, sugar is wonderful.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.236 align:middle line:90%
Everybody likes sugar.

00:11:45.236 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I like sugar, but I choose
not to thrive on sugar.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.550 align:middle line:10%
See, sugar should have been
in our fun foods-- building

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:10%
blocks, fuel, and fun.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.490 align:middle line:10%
Fun foods.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:10%
Every now and then
you have sugar.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:10%
But, sugar, 100 grams
of carbohydrates--

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:10%
I saw a study that was
either 100 grams or 200 grams

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:10%
recently where it said
that if you had a pizza

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.820 align:middle line:10%
meal, for instance,
or a pasta meal,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:10%
within 15 minutes of eating that
meal, your leukocytic index--

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.800 align:middle line:10%
which is basically, essentially,
a white blood cell-- how many

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.490 align:middle line:10%
bad guys can it eat in an hour?

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
The study was suggesting
it should be about 16

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:90%
per white blood cell in an hour.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.790 align:middle line:84%
But within eating this
carbohydrate meal,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:29.350 align:middle line:84%
within 15 minutes, you've
dropped from 16 to 1.9

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and hold that for hours.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have 10% capacity
that you're use to.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> 10% capacity.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And, basically, these
patients are often

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
in an immune-compromised
state to start with.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of the treatments
they are getting

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.042 align:middle line:84%
are taking their immunity
down to almost nothing.

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
throwing sugar in on top

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:84%
of that, which directly
feeds the problem,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:84%
but it also directly takes
a whack at the immunity.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.285 align:middle line:84%
It's a terrible cycle that
people need to consider.

00:12:55.285 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:84%
One century ago,
sugar was a delicacy.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.272 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have-- maybe Mom
would make an apple pie

00:13:03.272 --> 00:13:05.230 align:middle line:84%
or you'd go to the store
and get a little treat

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.188 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:13:06.188 --> 00:13:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Five pounds a year,
it's estimated,

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
would be the intake of
sugar per year, per person,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:90%
on the average.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Today, it's a whopping 150 plus
pounds per person, per year,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:90%
on the average.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And somebody is
eating our sugar.

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:90%
So the average is pretty high.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The point is, people are eating
their weight in sugar a year.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.690 align:middle line:84%
>> 150 pounds of sugar
per person, per year?

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:26.837 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that's incredible.

00:13:26.837 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to a few more
physicians talk about the way

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that sugar compromises
the immune system

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.042 align:middle line:84%
and also actually
fuels cancer cells.

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Talk about, briefly,
the connection

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.435 align:middle line:90%
between sugar and cancer cells.

00:13:38.435 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There's certain common
characteristics that all cancer

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:90%
cells have.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.050 align:middle line:84%
One of those characteristics
is that cancer

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.910 align:middle line:84%
is an obligate
glucose metabolizer,

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.470 align:middle line:84%
meaning that it
has an obligation

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to metabolize glucose.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:10%
It only survives on sugar.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:10%
Other types of
components that would

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:10%
be commonalities in
all cancer, cancer

00:13:54.430 --> 00:14:00.980 align:middle line:10%
is a highly anaerobic scenario.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Cancer likes an
anaerobic scenario.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Cancer does not
like oxygen. Oxygen

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:90%
works as a drug against cancer.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Another component would be,
cancer is an acidic process.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So in an alkaline environment,
cancer does not do well.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
common characteristics

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:90%
that cancer has.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
One of those is that it is an
obligate glucose metabolizer.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you can reduce the
amount of simple sugars,

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
you are effectively going
to be reducing the food

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.530 align:middle line:90%
supply to the cancer.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Patrick Quillin, who
wrote "Beating Cancer

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.613 align:middle line:84%
with Nutrition," a very good
friend of mine, in his book

00:14:33.613 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
says that 42% to 46%
of cancer patients

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
die of cachexia,
of malnutrition.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
How many oncologists are
addressing malnutrition?

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:90%
In fact, what do they do?

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:84%
They give people
Ensure, which is sugar.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.573 align:middle line:84%
You know that cancer is an
obligate glucose metabolizer.

00:14:48.573 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:90%
It needs sugar to survive.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of
the techniques is

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.604 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the amount of sugar so
that it can't feed the cancer.

00:14:53.604 --> 00:14:56.556 align:middle line:84%
But they're actually
giving gasoline to the fire

00:14:56.556 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and then expecting
to put out the fire.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't put out a
fire with gasoline.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to get the opinion
of Dr. Patrick Quillin,

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:84%
a nutritional expert who wrote
a book called "Beating Cancer

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.860 align:middle line:84%
with Nutrition," about the
effects of sugar on cancer

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.610 align:middle line:84%
cells and their
insidious relationship.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Cancer is a sugar feeder.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:10%
Cancer is what's called an
obligate glucose metabolizer,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:10%
meaning that there is a
dramatic uptake of glucose

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:10%
in the cells of tumor cells.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
If you can lower gut
and blood glucose,

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.414 align:middle line:84%
you can help to
slow down cancer.

00:15:27.414 --> 00:15:29.455 align:middle line:10%
>> Normal cells go through
what we call oxidative

00:15:29.455 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:10%
phosphorylation, which means
you take oxygen, you take sugar,

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:37.360 align:middle line:10%
and you make 32 molecules of
this ATP which is our energy

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.417 align:middle line:10%
currency, right?

00:15:38.417 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:10%
>> You said oxidative
phosphorylation?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Oxidative phosphorylation.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:10%
So we take oxygen, and
through this process

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:10%
we add a phosphorous
to this ATP,

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:10%
and that's our energy currency.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:90%
That's how we move about.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:90%
And the more ATP, the better.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.334 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a cell that is
able to undergo oxidative

00:15:57.334 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
phosphorolation-- and,
again, you're able to do that

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:84%
because a set of
genes is turned on--

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.490 align:middle line:84%
you have to go through what is
called the Krebs cycle, then

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.170 align:middle line:90%
that's a happy state.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
If you have to move to
this anaerobic, what

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.180 align:middle line:84%
we call anaerobic metabolism,
for every molecule of glucose

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:19.720 align:middle line:90%
you can't get 32 ATP anymore.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
You can only get two
molecules of ATP, right?

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And anaerobic means--

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Anaerobic means you
don't have to have oxygen.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> That means that I can
survive without oxygen, right,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:84%
which makes me able to survive
in a more toxic environment,

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
but it makes my energy
level a lot more restricted.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
So then that's why
cancer cells are

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:84%
so ravenous about having to
absorb sugar, because they can

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:90%
only make two ATP per molecule.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Because cancer
cells love sugar.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You hear that
phrase all the time,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and that explains why
that phrase came about.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:10%
And one of the tests that
we use to diagnose cancer

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.780 align:middle line:10%
is a PET scan.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:10%
So with a PET scan,
we take radiated sugar

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:10%
and we inject it in you.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:84%
Because cancer cells take up
sugar so much more efficiently

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
than normal cells, they will
take up that radiated sugar.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.624 align:middle line:84%
And then we're able
to see on the PET

00:17:14.624 --> 00:17:16.599 align:middle line:84%
scan were the sugar
is, which that tells us

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.360 align:middle line:90%
where the cancer is, right?

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.160 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're very aware
of the dependence

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
on cancer cells for
prodigious amounts of sugar,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's why cancer
patients die of starvation

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is because the cancer
cells will suck up

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:90%
all the sugar from human cells.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Sugar is a fuel
for cancer cells.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:10%
So, basically,
cancer cells, they

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:10%
have an altered metabolism,
an altered physiology,

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:10%
and they're not able to produce
energy from aerobic metabolism.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:10%
And so the mitochondria
itself is damaged.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So they depend on anaerobic
metabolism, so without oxygen,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.160 align:middle line:84%
which is basically
breaking down sugar.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So they utilize sugar,
and they produce

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.000 align:middle line:84%
a lot of waste products,
particularly one

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:84%
that we're probably all
familiar with, lactic acid.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And so they produce a
high amount of acids,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and they consume a tremendous
amount of energy in our system

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:90%
through sugar.

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, basically, when
we take the sugar out,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
we're taking out the
preferred fuel source

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:21.020 align:middle line:84%
for the cancer cells, so they
become weakened in that state.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to when we're fueling
our body with a lot of sugar,

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:84%
not only does it cause the
free radical damage, which

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is what actually damages the
mitochondria to begin with

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.506 align:middle line:84%
and creates this whole
process, but at the same time,

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
we're also providing
the preferred fuel

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.930 align:middle line:84%
source for more cancer cell
development in our body.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:84%
See, what most people
realize is, all of us

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:41.560 align:middle line:90%
have cancer cells.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.359 align:middle line:84%
We're all developing
them every single day.

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Typically, our immune
system would hunt them down

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:90%
and regulate them.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:84%
However, when we've got
immune deficiencies, which

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.770 align:middle line:84%
is another problem
with sugar, it

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.450 align:middle line:84%
weakens our body's
innate immune system.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when that happens,
now these cancer cells

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.710 align:middle line:84%
will start to grow without
being checked, being

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
kept in check, by our body's
natural immune response.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So we just continue
to dump in the sugar.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:10%
Again, we're weakening
our immune system,

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:10%
and we're strengthening
the cancer cells.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:10%
We're actually giving them
an advantage in our body.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.526 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, you can
feed one or the other.

00:19:15.526 --> 00:19:17.650 align:middle line:84%
You can feed your immune
system and strengthen that

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.012 align:middle line:84%
or you can feed the cancer
and strengthen that.

00:19:20.012 --> 00:19:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And, I think, if we all
have this understanding

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.375 align:middle line:84%
and this knowledge
and really knew that,

00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
obviously, we would want
to feed our immune system.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.791 align:middle line:84%
>> While I was at the Cancer
Control Society Convention

00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:30.670 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles
earlier this year,

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I was able to speak with
Bob Wright of the American

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.126 align:middle line:90%
Anti-Cancer Institute.

00:19:34.126 --> 00:19:35.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Another thing
that sugar does,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:10%
and most people
don't know about is,

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:10%
the average amount of sugar in
one can of let's say Coca-Cola,

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:10%
it's probably 9 or 10
teaspoons of sugar in there.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:10%
That's enough sugar to
effectively shut down

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:10%
a minimum of 50% of your
immune system for four hours.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.560 align:middle line:90%
One 12-ounce Coke.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're a cancer patient,
can you afford that?

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Since the immune system is the
only thing that can heal you,

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.895 align:middle line:90%
we simply can't afford that.

00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You've got to avoid
all the sugar.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:10%
If you take a Diet
Pepsi or Coke,

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:10%
it ranges from 2.5 to 2.7 pH.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:10%
Very acidic.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:10%
And acid, if you're
a cancer patient,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.530 align:middle line:10%
is one of your main
problems to begin with,

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:10%
acid and inflammation.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And we know, from Dr. Weeks,
we've known this before,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:10%
that inflammation causes
metastases of cancer as well.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
But it would take you
32 12-ounce glasses

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.560 align:middle line:84%
of 9.5 pH water to
neutralize that one

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:90%
12-ounce can of Coca-Cola.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're
acidic, and that's

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.720 align:middle line:90%
why we're struggling today.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's see what
Suzanne Somers--

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:84%
one of America's most
beloved personalities--

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and Burton Goldberg-- who is
actually highlighted in her

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
bestselling book "Knockout"--
have to say about this issue.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:10%
>> When I get tempted, because
I've got this ice cream shop

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.360 align:middle line:10%
down the corner that I--

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:10%
I love ice cream.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I love ice cream
and I love cake.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Who doesn't?

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Who doesn't?

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
I then envision the little
bad guys in my GI tract going,

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.214 align:middle line:90%
come on, you can have some.

00:21:02.214 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Come on, give me some.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.426 align:middle line:90%
Because all they want is sugar.

00:21:04.426 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:90%
They need sugar.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:90%
They thrive on sugar.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.810 align:middle line:90%
They have to have sugar.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:90%
And I say to them, no.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I am going to
starve you to death.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
My job is to stamp
you out, so I'm never

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:20.866 align:middle line:90%
giving you your Happy Meal.

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But how can the
oncologist's office--

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen it where
you go into their office

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:84%
and they have candy
bowls with candy

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.794 align:middle line:84%
there, because cancer patients
on chemotherapy are so weak

00:21:32.794 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and they need a
little pick me up.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I have looked at
that at different times

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:90%
in oncologist's office going--

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>> What are they thinking?

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you thinking?

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:10%
>> The oncologists use sugar to
carry the radiologic molecule

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:10%
into the cancer cell to show
up on the X-ray, the PET scan.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
The oncologist knows
that sugar feeds cancer,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:84%
because that's why he uses
it, as a Trojan horse.

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you finish your chemo,
in a conventional setting,

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
they give you cookies
and ice cream or candy.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
That is tantamount to
putting gasoline on a fire.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
That means these oncologists
are guilty of crimes

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.730 align:middle line:90%
against humanity.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.650 align:middle line:90%
They are killing their patients.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow!

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.517 align:middle line:84%
Passionate words from
a very passionate man.

00:22:37.517 --> 00:22:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all starting
to get the picture here

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
about how sugar
feeds cancer cells

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and it compromises
our immune system.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:90%
But that lends the question--

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.892 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is
the immune system?

00:22:47.892 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't think
of a better person

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to answer that question than
immunologist AJ Lanigan.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I'm old enough
to remember "Tricky Dick"

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.125 align:middle line:84%
Nixon saying, we're going to
have a cure for cancer in 10

00:22:59.125 --> 00:22:59.925 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:22:59.925 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, he
wasn't a math major.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:90%
So where is it?

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Is there, in fact,
even a cure for cancer?

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm not smart enough
to tell you that there is,

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and I don't make no
claim that I have one.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.860 align:middle line:10%
But I do know this.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:10%
To overcome cancer, to
stop it before it begins,

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:25.160 align:middle line:10%
or to reverse it once
you've contracted it,

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm pretty much convinced
the immune system is going

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.750 align:middle line:10%
to have to be a major player.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system is
really the only thing

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:84%
that stands between you and
all those things in you,

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
on you, and around you trying
to get you all the time.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Cancer included.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.210 align:middle line:84%
The largest number of
immune cells in your body

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:90%
are known as neutrophils.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:84%
When you go get your blood work,
just standard old blood work,

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
NEU is the abbreviation
for neutrophils.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.360 align:middle line:84%
On any given day, they'll
account for anywhere

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.820 align:middle line:84%
from 50% to 70% of your
total immune army, which

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:84%
are basically your
white blood cells.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Ty, they can't see cancer.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
They can't see it
on your best day.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.670 align:middle line:10%
The majority of your immune
system cannot see cancer.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:21.320 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the very narrow
margin would be made up

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:10%
of natural killer cells, and
they're constantly surveilling

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:10%
all the cells in your body.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:90%
Healthy cell-- smiley face.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.836 align:middle line:90%
Healthy cell-- smiley face.

00:24:35.836 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Hm, this cell doesn't
have a smiley face.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:90%
Badda-bing, badda-boom.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the job of
natural killer cells.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:84%
There may be virus
hiding inside that cell.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.270 align:middle line:90%
That cell could be mutating.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:84%
It could be mutating
and be benign,

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
it could be mutating
and turning cancerous.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.050 align:middle line:90%
No smiley face.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
You got some cytotoxic
T lymphocytes--

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.830 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about them
being ninja cells.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>> What does cytotoxic mean?

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Cytotoxic means,
think of cyto--

00:25:08.845 --> 00:25:11.100 align:middle line:90%
cytoplasm.

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the guts of the cell.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:90%
That's the innards.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So if something
is cytotoxic, that

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:21.370 align:middle line:84%
means that when it hits a
cell, it basically blows it

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:90%
up and lets the guts come out.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So cells, for example,
your NK cells.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Their job is to keep
ramming into that cell that

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.210 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a smiley face.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.830 align:middle line:10%
And every time it rams into
it, it releases chemicals

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:10%
into the lining of that target
cell until it finally bursts

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:10%
open, or lyses, L-Y-S-E.
It will lyse that cell wall

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.530 align:middle line:10%
and the juice comes out.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:90%
The cytoplasm.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.407 align:middle line:84%
The same thing happens with
cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

00:25:55.407 --> 00:25:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Question for you, then.

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
On these, you've
got T lymphocytes,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.950 align:middle line:84%
you've got neutrophils, you've
got NK cells, natural killer

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:90%
cells.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.350 align:middle line:84%
The neutrophils
and the NK cells,

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.819 align:middle line:84%
are they lymphocytes
or are they leukocytes?

00:26:09.819 --> 00:26:11.110 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference between--

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Let me try to give you
a picture for that.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Think of the immune
system as having two arms.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And let's call one of these arms
"specific" and the other arm

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.910 align:middle line:90%
is "nonspecific."

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when I talk in
terms of nonspecific,

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about neutrophils,
macrophages-- or macrophages,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:84%
depending on which side of
the Atlantic you're educated--

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.500 align:middle line:90%
eosinophils.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And these cells are
basically frontline,

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and they deal with
simply one question--

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Are you self, S-E-L-F?

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.480 align:middle line:10%
And if the question
is not yes, then

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:10%
basically their
job is to kick butt

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:10%
and get rid of whatever it is.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:10%
Now, on the other side, the
specific immune response

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.760 align:middle line:10%
is going to be
things like B cells.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, B cells are lymphocytes.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
B cells, and all the
other cells, by the way,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.342 align:middle line:90%
are borne from the bone marrow.

00:27:21.342 --> 00:27:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, AJ really explained
the immune system in such a way

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.610 align:middle line:84%
that even a child
can understand it.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But he mentioned the fact that
most of the immune system,

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.850 align:middle line:84%
the majority of immune
system, I think he said,

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.800 align:middle line:90%
cannot even see cancer cells.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.471 align:middle line:90%
What did he mean by that?

00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I was in LA earlier this year
speaking at the Cancer Control

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Society Convention, and I sat
down with Dr. Tony Jimenez,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and he shed some light
on this information.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.300 align:middle line:10%
>> As physicians, and as
practitioners or advisors

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:10%
or counselors, we
always tell patients,

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.710 align:middle line:10%
and people in general, let's
enhance your immune system

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.470 align:middle line:10%
if you have cancer, because
we know that the immune system

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.454 align:middle line:10%
takes care of a cold to cancer
and everything in between.

00:27:57.454 --> 00:27:58.370 align:middle line:10%
So that's the thought.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.830 align:middle line:10%
Let's optimize
the immune system,

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:05.270 align:middle line:10%
and we've gone a long way in
addressing a cancer situation.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But let's think
about it this way.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:84%
We know that in one cubic
centimeter of a tumor,

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.390 align:middle line:84%
there is approximately
1 billion cancer cells.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's billion, with a B.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> 65% of those cells, at
any one time, were dormant.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.020 align:middle line:90%
35% of those cells are active.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:84%
So they're in the synthesis
phase of the cell cycle,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:90%
not in the resting phase.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Remember mitosis in
101 Biology, right?

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.180 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
talking about.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So, of all those
cells, 99% of the cells

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:84%
are what's called
non-cancer stem cells.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>> 1%, about, are
cancer stem cells.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So when someone has
chemo or radiation,

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:84%
they are not only suppressing
the immune system,

00:28:55.850 --> 00:29:00.170 align:middle line:84%
but they're making the cancer
stem cells more active and more

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.250 align:middle line:90%
aggressive.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the boogers
you've got to worry about.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Those are the boogers
you have to worry about.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Because they survive
in the bloodstream.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:84%
They're immortal, if you
don't do something about them,

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.520 align:middle line:84%
not like the
non-cancer stem cells

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.020 align:middle line:90%
that the chemo is affecting.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:84%
So, wow, someone has
80% reduction in tumor

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.240 align:middle line:90%
or now you're in remission.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>> You got rid of
the good cells,

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and the bad cells you
just strengthened.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And the non-cancer stem
cells are not necessarily

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:31.190 align:middle line:84%
good cells, Ty,
but they're cells

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.080 align:middle line:90%
that have a finite lifespan.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And they make the
bulk of the tumor.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> You see?

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So then the tumor decreases
because the chemo and radiation

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.450 align:middle line:84%
can affect the
non-cancer stem cell.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So the patient has a PET scan,
MRI, CAT scan, bone scan,

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.300 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, and they
have a false impression,

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.290 align:middle line:84%
by their physician, that now
they can't see the tumor.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So you're in remission,
but the cancer

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.720 align:middle line:84%
stem cells were never
addressed with the chemo,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and never will with the
chemo and radiation.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.410 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to your question.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>> No, this is
fantastic information.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So the cancer stem cells
are cells that survive

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.860 align:middle line:90%
in the bloodstream.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They are like five
star generals.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:14.660 align:middle line:84%
They've been tested
and in battle,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to metastasize.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
See, non-cancer stem
cells cannot metastasize.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.350 align:middle line:10%
Only cancer stem cells can.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.910 align:middle line:10%
So when we want to address
the immune system in cancer,

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:31.940 align:middle line:10%
the problem is, the immune
system cannot recognize cancer

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.270 align:middle line:10%
stem cells.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a
protein on the cell

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.560 align:middle line:84%
surface that shields
them, or cloaks them,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.670 align:middle line:90%
from the immune system.

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Robert Rowen,
a good friend of ours,

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the
January, 2014, newsletter,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.540 align:middle line:84%
"Second Opinion," he wrote
an article on cancer stem

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.860 align:middle line:84%
cell's ability to cloak, or
hide themselves from the immune

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:55.850 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:58.490 align:middle line:10%
So a cancer patient may
have the best immune system

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.490 align:middle line:10%
according to white blood
cells, T cells, lymphocytes,

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:07.100 align:middle line:10%
natural killer cells, but is
that immune system recognizing

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.010 align:middle line:10%
and able to penetrate
a cancer stem cell?

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.300 align:middle line:10%
That's the question.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.959 align:middle line:10%
>> And what you're saying is
that these cancer stem cells

00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:16.250 align:middle line:10%
have some kind of a cloaking
to where the immune system

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:10%
can't see them.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's well describe in
conventional scientific medical

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:90%
literature.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:84%
This is not an
alternative thought.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:84%
This is dually
scientifically proven.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Dr. Jimenez,
the immune system cannot see

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.910 align:middle line:84%
the cancer stem cells, which
he calls the five star generals

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.160 align:middle line:90%
that are directing the invasion.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So what can we do
to make these cells

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.800 align:middle line:90%
visible to our immune system?

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.960 align:middle line:10%
>> There are substances that
have been shown to attack

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.400 align:middle line:10%
cancer stem cells,
scientifically, like metformin,

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.820 align:middle line:10%
ellagic acid, green tea extract.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.650 align:middle line:84%
But the list is very small
because, first of all,

00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:00.860 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult to extract
cancer stem cells from a human

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and keep them alive in the
lab for them to be studied.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.460 align:middle line:84%
There's only a few
labs that do that,

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and this is a very, very
expensive process, right,

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.090 align:middle line:84%
in the millions of dollars
to study cancer stem cells.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> All the more reason
to eat fresh berries,

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:84%
like raspberries and
blackberries and strawberries,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and to keep drinking
your green tea,

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:84%
since they all contain high
amounts of ellagic acid.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And as Dr. Jimenez
just mentioned,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:84%
ellagic acid targets
cancer stem cells,

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:84%
which are otherwise invisible
to the immune system.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's listen to
what AJ Lanigan has

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.560 align:middle line:84%
to say about the amazing way
that the T helper lymphocytes

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.440 align:middle line:84%
communicate with and regulate
the other immune cells.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, the macrophages,
the neutrophils,

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the natural killers, how
do they regulate them?

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Through what we call cytokines.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Chemical messengers.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.400 align:middle line:10%
Think of them as chemical
e-mails or faxes.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:10%
And so that's very important.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:10%
Not just the cells, but
also cellular communication.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.750 align:middle line:84%
All of this working,
by the way, Ty,

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.420 align:middle line:90%
we don't give one thought to it.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
There is more wisdom
in one of these cells

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.950 align:middle line:84%
than there has been in all the
libraries that have ever been,

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.290 align:middle line:90%
are now, or ever will be.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.530 align:middle line:90%
I think that's pretty cool.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you can
imagine the immune cell

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:84%
as a guy or gal in the army,
and they're dropped out there

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.410 align:middle line:90%
in Timbuktu.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:90%
And the enemy is firing.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And the enemy is advancing,
and they're doing their job,

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.600 align:middle line:84%
fighting back and
shooting and so forth.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And all of sudden, here
comes the garbage truck

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and dumps all this
rotten garbage

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.880 align:middle line:90%
in the foxhole with you.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:10%
Well, are you going to
fight and shoot or are you

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.340 align:middle line:10%
going to tote garbage?

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:58.130 align:middle line:10%
So if you can get that
figured in your mind, then

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:10%
it helps you to understand.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
This is why I don't need
to consume so much sugar.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
This is why I don't need
to consume, or be around,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:12.370 align:middle line:84%
all these things that we've come
to learn aren't good for you.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.080 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just, well,
my mama told me so.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
burdens that we're

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:22.199 align:middle line:84%
putting on the immune system
prevent it from digging in

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and fighting the fight
and protecting you.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.010 align:middle line:84%
If your immune system's got to
make its living toting garbage,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to live very long.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're going
to be constantly besieged

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:90%
with disease and pestilence.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the
way you want to live,

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:84%
keep doing what
you've been doing.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.525 align:middle line:90%
So are you sick?

00:34:44.525 --> 00:34:47.150 align:middle line:84%
If you are, you probably need to
look at what you've been doing

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and maybe change some habits.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.226 align:middle line:84%
Didn't Einstein say that
the definition of insanity

00:34:51.226 --> 00:34:52.808 align:middle line:84%
was doing the same
thing over and over

00:34:52.808 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:90%
and expecting different results?

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.989 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to Dr. Véronique
Desaulniers, Dr. V.,

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:58.640 align:middle line:84%
as she explains
the immune system,

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:90%
our first line of defense.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The immune
system is powerful.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.640 align:middle line:10%
It's the first line
of defense that we

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:10.550 align:middle line:10%
have against bacteria, viruses,
pathogens, and cancer cells.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And what a lot of
people don't realize

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.420 align:middle line:84%
is that the immune
system is powerful.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.230 align:middle line:84%
It has over hundreds of
functions in the body.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And there are billions,
billions of immune cells

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.480 align:middle line:90%
at your disposal every day.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I think of
our immune system,

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.800 align:middle line:84%
I think of a "Star
Wars" galactic battle

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.080 align:middle line:84%
going on because the
immune system really

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.120 align:middle line:90%
does some incredible things.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the immune
cells will shoot out

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.300 align:middle line:84%
specific particles
that will blast open

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:90%
a virus in a cancer cell.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Other immune cells will secrete
specific chemical poisons

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.510 align:middle line:90%
to cause those pathogens to die.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Other immune cells will send out
these long, sticky, gooey pods

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and engulf the pathogen
and the cancer cell

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and recycle it and
use its body parts.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.417 align:middle line:84%
So the immune system
is very powerful.

00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And the important thing to
know about your immune system

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is that 80% of
your immune system

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.480 align:middle line:84%
is in the mucosal lining
of your intestinal tract.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So, if you don't have a
healthy intestinal tract,

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.600 align:middle line:84%
if you're feeding your body
a lot of junk, you know,

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the typical S-A-D foods, SAD
food, standard American Diet

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:21.450 align:middle line:84%
food, your immune system
is going to be compromised.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>> No doctor has ever
healed anyone of anything

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:10%
in the history of the world.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.760 align:middle line:84%
The human immune system
heals, and that's

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:90%
the only thing that heals.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.890 align:middle line:10%
True, doctors sometimes can
alleviate symptoms enough so

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.290 align:middle line:10%
the body can go back
and heal itself.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the doctor gets the
credit for the healing.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm all right with that.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But we need to stop
dealing with symptoms

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and start dealing
with causation.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Bob Wright just said
something very interesting.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Doctors don't heal, the
immune system heals.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on down the road to
Amarillo, Texas, to talk to Dr.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Roby Mitchell and
get his perspective.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>> With a weakened
immune system,

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.690 align:middle line:84%
then that allows cancer
cells to grow better, right?

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:90%
So they do work together.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that's another
reason why one

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:11.230 align:middle line:84%
of the protocols for many
physicians that treat cancer

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.311 align:middle line:84%
is to bring down
the fungal load.

00:37:13.311 --> 00:37:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Because if you bring
down the fungal load,

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.830 align:middle line:84%
then the immune system
gets stronger, right?

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.850 align:middle line:10%
The one thing that does
kill cancer, cure cancer,

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:24.100 align:middle line:10%
is your immune system.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.070 align:middle line:10%
Chemotherapy, radiation,
these things--

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.920 align:middle line:10%
if you go to the
Cancer 101 book,

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.770 align:middle line:10%
it will tell you that
they can't cure cancer.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The cell kinetics
are just against it.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.550 align:middle line:90%
That will never happen.

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the same effect
as when we give antibiotics.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Antibiotics can't cure anything.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.410 align:middle line:84%
They can bring down the
number, the cell count,

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:49.220 align:middle line:84%
such that then your immune
system can take over,

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's your immune system
that does the curing.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand that
the thing that cures cancer

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.880 align:middle line:90%
is your immune system.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:06.070 align:middle line:84%
If we stay with the
bacterial overgrowth analogy,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I might need to give
a bit of an antibiotic

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.100 align:middle line:84%
to get the number down so
that your immune system is

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
just not overwhelmed, but
then bring that number down,

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.560 align:middle line:84%
and then your immune
system can take over.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.490 align:middle line:84%
There may be a role for
chemotherapy, radiation

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:22.760 align:middle line:90%
therapy, in that sense.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.415 align:middle line:90%


00:38:26.415 --> 00:38:31.310 align:middle line:10%
The overwhelming majority of
physicians who treat cancer

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.840 align:middle line:10%
with those therapies,
depend solely

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:10%
on the radiation or the chemo.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And the consequence of that
is a weakened immune system.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So the very system that you're
depending on to cure cancer,

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:90%
we kill that off, right?

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's why so many
people with cancer,

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.250 align:middle line:84%
they die of the treatment
rather than the cancer.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone has cancer
cells in their body.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:84%
The only permanent cure to
cancer is your immune system.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And nutrition gives
your immune system

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:07.330 align:middle line:84%
the firepower it needs
to keep you well.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:84%
So, without nutrition, you're
fighting with no weapons.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.680 align:middle line:10%
Without your immune system,
you're fighting with no army.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.300 align:middle line:10%
Chemotherapy destroys your army.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.610 align:middle line:10%
It destroys your immune system.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, it causes
secondary cancers in the body,

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.030 align:middle line:84%
it makes existing cancer
stem cells more aggressive,

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and it causes a host of
lifelong, potentially lifelong,

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.070 align:middle line:84%
damages to the body, from
brain damage, to hearing loss,

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.370 align:middle line:84%
to neuropathy-- the loss of the
use of your hands and feet--

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.550 align:middle line:90%
to kidney and bladder damage.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:43.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, bone damage,
heart damage, lung damage.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just total collateral
damage from chemotherapy.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.850 align:middle line:10%
>> So a lot of times you can
give chemotherapy and the tumor

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.340 align:middle line:10%
goes away, but you also
destroy the immune system.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Then the cancer comes
back with a vengeance.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.480 align:middle line:84%
That's how you
get rid of cancer,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.340 align:middle line:84%
through your immune
system, through systems

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:01.910 align:middle line:84%
that are already within
you that have failed.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:07.065 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
get them to work again.

00:40:07.065 --> 00:40:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And that difference has
made a tremendous difference

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:11.419 align:middle line:90%
in the results.

00:40:11.419 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Radiation is bad
for any healthy person.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:13.480 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:10%
Because it suppresses the immune
system and causes [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.520 align:middle line:10%
to form so that cells mutate and
then you end up getting cancer.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So now somebody has
cancer, what do you do?

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:84%
You put them into
that very same thing

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:84%
that you know is
going to cause cancer.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, radiation is supposed
to kill the cancer, that's

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.090 align:middle line:90%
the philosophy.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But you're also going
to cause more mutation

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.220 align:middle line:84%
to the healthy cells and cause
a worsening of the effects.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:31.761 align:middle line:84%
It's like pouring
gasoline on a fire.

00:40:31.761 --> 00:40:35.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Where is the disconnect
mentally that we have been

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:84%
brainwashed into believing
that we can cure cancer with

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.460 align:middle line:90%
substances that cause cancer?

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.180 align:middle line:90%
No, exactly.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.180 align:middle line:10%
We live in a culture that has
allowed itself to be dominated

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.500 align:middle line:10%
by truly insane ideas.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> For example,
radiotherapy for cancer.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, if radiation is so
good at treating cancer,

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.930 align:middle line:84%
then we should turn Fukushima
into a global cancer treatment

00:40:58.930 --> 00:40:59.730 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The cancer industry is
really driven by greed and money

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:90%
because there is a cure.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:10%
People are healing
from cancer every day

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.200 align:middle line:10%
without the use of toxic drugs.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.810 align:middle line:10%
There are literally
thousands and thousands

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.900 align:middle line:10%
of published studies that
prove the effectiveness

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.460 align:middle line:10%
of natural medicine.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But you can't patent a plant,
and you can't patent an herb.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, there is no money and
no financial gain in teaching

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.590 align:middle line:90%
people about these things.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, the sad thing
is that millions of people

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.800 align:middle line:84%
are being sacrificed, and
they're dying horrific deaths,

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and having horrific symptoms as
a result of these treatments.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And, oftentimes, they die as a
result of the cancer treatment

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.570 align:middle line:84%
itself and not so
much the cancer.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.370 align:middle line:90%
That's sad.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:50.060 align:middle line:84%
That actually happened to
my parents, specifically,

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:50.860 align:middle line:90%
my father.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.860 align:middle line:90%
He was diagnosed with cancer.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.410 align:middle line:84%
He was dead 25 days later,
and he died from the surgery.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So I know that to be true
from a personal perspective.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Chemo destroys
the immune system.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Radiation destroys
the immune system.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like adding
gasoline to the fire.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dr. V. just
mentioned the fact

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that there is a cancer
industry, in her own words.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get more information
about this cancer industry,

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:16.930 align:middle line:84%
so I headed back to Detroit to
talk to Dr. David Brownstein.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard you mention
the cancer medical complex.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.200 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean when
you talk about the cancer

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:23.109 align:middle line:90%
medical complex?

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:25.650 align:middle line:10%
>> So I have written about this,
and I say the cancer medical

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:10%
complex is this whole monolith
that's been set up to make

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.880 align:middle line:10%
money on cancer.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.970 align:middle line:10%
And so let's take
the woman who is--

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.760 align:middle line:10%
a young woman who has been
feeling a breast lump,

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.020 align:middle line:10%
goes to her doctor.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.480 align:middle line:84%
She goes for a mammogram,
they pick up something.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.020 align:middle line:84%
She's going to go for a
biopsy, they pick up something.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, she's going to
go for an excision.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, she's got cancer.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.110 align:middle line:84%
She's going to get
chemo and radiation.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It's this whole system
set up to treat cancer,

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and it's a multi-trillion
dollar industry right now.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is,
people aren't living

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.450 align:middle line:90%
longer from these therapies.

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:58.900 align:middle line:84%
There's very few cancers
that we've done well with.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.610 align:middle line:84%
We've done well with some
of the blood cancers,

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.350 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
leukemias and lymphomas,

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.000 align:middle line:90%
and testicular cancer.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.710 align:middle line:84%
The rest of them,
the mortality rate

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.952 align:middle line:84%
has not changed much over
the last 70 to 80 years.

00:43:10.952 --> 00:43:13.410 align:middle line:84%
We have one in seven women with
breast cancer in the United

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:17.010 align:middle line:84%
States, one in three men
with prostate cancer.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:20.580 align:middle line:84%
We've got lung cancer
and colon cancer, more

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:21.870 align:middle line:90%
than we know what to do with.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And, really, the
conventional therapies

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.790 align:middle line:84%
for most types of
cancer are pretty bad.

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:10%
You know, if you look at the
cancer statistics from 1930,

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:35.300 align:middle line:10%
which are being kept
until the present day,

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.210 align:middle line:10%
our mortality rate is
really unchanged for most

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.660 align:middle line:10%
of the hard tumors, which is
breast, lung, prostate, colon.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.340 align:middle line:10%
And it's really
sad because we're

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.446 align:middle line:10%
spending these billions
and trillions of dollars

00:43:46.446 --> 00:43:47.820 align:middle line:10%
on therapies that
aren't working.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.190 align:middle line:10%
We really need to go back
to work to figure out--

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:52.240 align:middle line:10%
What's the underlying
cause of these illnesses?

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.406 align:middle line:10%
And I can tell you, the
underlying cause of cancer--

00:43:54.406 --> 00:43:55.620 align:middle line:10%
it's multi-factorial.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.960 align:middle line:10%
There's not one single
cause for everybody.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.620 align:middle line:10%
But I think that toxicity is
part of the problem with it.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Poor nutrition is part of it.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Poor diet is part of it.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Dehydration is part of it.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:10.262 align:middle line:84%
Lack of iodine is
a big part of it.

00:44:10.262 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole bunch
of things going on,

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and either we start to treat
these underlying causes that

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.536 align:middle line:84%
are, I think, part
of the underlying

00:44:17.536 --> 00:44:19.410 align:middle line:84%
cause of the problem of
cancer, or we're just

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:22.020 align:middle line:84%
going to continue going on
with so many people suffering

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:22.820 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Brownstein mentioned
getting to the root causes

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.940 align:middle line:84%
instead of just treating
symptoms of disease.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at hormones and
the immune system in cancer.

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Is there a connection
between the three?

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.381 align:middle line:10%
>> If your hormones
are not working,

00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:36.630 align:middle line:10%
your immune system can't work.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:37.713 align:middle line:10%
For example, your thyroid.

00:44:37.713 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:10%
The thyroid is the
battery to your body.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So the thyroid, if
it's not functioning,

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.770 align:middle line:90%
it cannot take care of you.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It drives the metabolism of
every single cell in your body.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately,
a lot more people

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:53.770 align:middle line:84%
are low thyroid today
because of wheat--

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:56.340 align:middle line:84%
wheat is very allergenic
to the thyroid--

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and because of radiation
from the most recent

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Japanese nuclear power plant.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So a lot more
people are becoming

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:90%
low thyroid because of that.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Then, if you've got any kind
of other hormonal imbalances--

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.922 align:middle line:84%
For example, when do
guys get prostate cancer?

00:45:14.922 --> 00:45:16.380 align:middle line:84%
They don't get
prostate cancer when

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.090 align:middle line:84%
they're 25 when all their
hormones are in great shape.

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.400 align:middle line:84%
They get prostate
cancer after 50

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.400 align:middle line:84%
because that's when the
hormones start changing.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the difference
between the hormones in females

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and males.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to get to a
question concerning the effect

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:31.930 align:middle line:90%
of estrogens on cancers.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:34.710 align:middle line:10%
>> There's no difference
in the molecular aspect

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.290 align:middle line:10%
of the hormones that
are in men and women.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Women have
testosterone, men have

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:43.680 align:middle line:10%
estrogen. Both have progesterone
and corticosteroids and all

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.550 align:middle line:10%
these.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.400 align:middle line:90%
What's different is the amount.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So women have a higher
amount of estrogens.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Men have a higher
amount of testosterone.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Women have a higher amount
of estrogen receptors.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And men have a higher amount
of testosterone receptors.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And so that's key, that
marriage between the receptor

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.890 align:middle line:90%
and the hormone.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Such that, I can give a woman
testosterone injections.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.130 align:middle line:84%
She will never get
as big as a man

00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:16.860 align:middle line:84%
because she doesn't have the
receptors that a man has.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.260 align:middle line:90%
We can put estrogen into a man.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
turn him into a woman,

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.810 align:middle line:84%
right, because he doesn't
have the receptors

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.700 align:middle line:90%
for those estrogens.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But we all produce the same
exact molecules, as far

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:35.880 align:middle line:84%
as estrogens and testosterone
and DHA and progesterone

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:90%
and these other hormones.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.590 align:middle line:84%
It's important
that we understand,

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:84%
for these estrogens,
the human ones

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:84%
anyway that, again, one of the
pharmacologic characteristics

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of estrogens is that
they make cells multiply.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
important in pregnancy

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.290 align:middle line:84%
because that fetus
has to grow so much.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And so during pregnancy,
estrogen levels go way up

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and, again, we get
exponential growth of a fetus.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Other cells, if they get exposed
to higher levels of estrogen,

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:12.960 align:middle line:90%
then they can grow faster also.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So in breast cancer, in prostate
cancer, or other cancers,

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.670 align:middle line:84%
if estrogen levels
are elevated, or if we

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.689 align:middle line:84%
are exposed to a more
potent estrogen--

00:47:22.689 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:84%
so this is where we're getting
into environmental estrogens--

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:28.010 align:middle line:84%
then that cancer
can grow faster.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily that
endogenous estrogens cause

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.670 align:middle line:84%
cancer, but they can
certainly-- like insulin,

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:37.800 align:middle line:84%
that's the other
cancer-promoting hormone--

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.200 align:middle line:84%
they can make the
fire burn hotter.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:42.800 align:middle line:90%
Great analogy.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's like more
gasoline on the fire

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.310 align:middle line:84%
when you have a higher level of
estrogen than you should have.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Which, lots of articles
today that we're reading about

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.990 align:middle line:84%
the effect of what they
call xenoestrogens,

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:56.824 align:middle line:84%
which are fake estrogens
in the environment.

00:47:56.824 --> 00:47:57.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:47:57.623 --> 00:48:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So can you talk about that
a little bit in relationship

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:00.900 align:middle line:90%
to cancer?

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the reasons why we

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.550 align:middle line:84%
see such a proliferation
of cancer in the West,

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:07.770 align:middle line:90%
and have seen it in the West.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing it more in
Third World countries now.

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:16.050 align:middle line:84%
But because of our exposure
to environmental and

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:19.230 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical
estrogens, that has

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.660 align:middle line:84%
the effect of throwing
more gasoline on the fire.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.340 align:middle line:10%
So some of the
insecticides, pesticides,

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.630 align:middle line:10%
fungicides that we use, they
have an estrogen effect.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.550 align:middle line:10%
These are what we
call xenoestrogens,

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:34.710 align:middle line:10%
xeno meaning foreign.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:38.400 align:middle line:90%
So, again, long-term exposure.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So we have to think about
estrogen exposure in lifetime

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.860 align:middle line:84%
exposure as we do with
radiation exposure.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
radiation technologist,

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:52.110 align:middle line:84%
you were a little badge on you
that gives us a Geiger counter

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:54.345 align:middle line:84%
amount of radiation
that you are getting

00:48:54.345 --> 00:48:55.470 align:middle line:90%
exposed to over a lifetime.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.428 align:middle line:84%
When you get to here,
they say, well, you can't

00:48:57.428 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:90%
be exposed any more radiation.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.450 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with these estrogens.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:03.480 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lifetime
exposure of estrogen

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:07.860 align:middle line:84%
that dictates your risk
for different cancers.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So you are producing
estrogens as a human.

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.620 align:middle line:84%
As a man, you're producing
estrogen. As a woman,

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.180 align:middle line:90%
they're producing estrogens.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Women produce more.

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So if we go adding on top of
that, environmental estrogens,

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.670 align:middle line:84%
then that increases your
lifetime exposure of estrogen.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.570 align:middle line:84%
If you take birth control pills,
that increases your lifetime

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:31.650 align:middle line:84%
exposure of estrogen. If
you take synthetic hormone

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:35.610 align:middle line:84%
replacement after menopause,
that increases your lifetime

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:39.840 align:middle line:84%
exposure of estrogen.
If you stay overweight

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.230 align:middle line:84%
with these fat cells that
are borne of inflammation,

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.830 align:middle line:84%
these growth factors, that
is increasing your lifetime

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.757 align:middle line:90%
exposure of estrogen.

00:49:48.757 --> 00:49:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's really a cumulative
effect when we're talking about

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.530 align:middle line:90%
the exposure to estrogens.

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> As opposed to just a one-off.

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm hearing hormones,
estrogen, testosterone,

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:01.950 align:middle line:90%
thyroid, immune system.

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So, naturally, my
thought goes to fat cells

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:06.450 align:middle line:90%
and cancer and obesity.

00:50:06.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Is there any kind
of relationship

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.130 align:middle line:90%
between obesity and cancer?

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to Dr. Roby
Mitchell, Dr. James Forsyth,

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Patrick Quillin
address this issue.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll just talk about
obesity for a second.

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.970 align:middle line:90%
2/3 of Americans are overweight.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:24.475 align:middle line:84%
Half of them, or 1/3 of
them, are medically obese.

00:50:24.475 --> 00:50:26.880 align:middle line:10%
And you realize that
obesity increases

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.900 align:middle line:10%
the risk for diabetes,
hypertension, a couple

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.250 align:middle line:10%
of different types of cancers--

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:38.100 align:middle line:10%
colon and breast-- gallstones,
Alzheimer's, the list goes on.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And, yet, the more we focus
on obesity, the more nutrition

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.410 align:middle line:84%
supplements that are
available for it,

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.380 align:middle line:84%
it seems the fatter
America gets.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And a big part of that has been
some of the misinformation that

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:50.370 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:52.920 align:middle line:84%
In the '70s and '80s
they said, don't eat fat.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.962 align:middle line:84%
You won't get fat if
you don't eat fat.

00:50:54.962 --> 00:50:56.170 align:middle line:90%
So they said, what can I eat?

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, anything but fat.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So we loaded the
food with sugar.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got more
obesity than ever.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:04.939 align:middle line:10%
>> I always tell patients, every
cancer diet is a weight loss

00:51:04.939 --> 00:51:07.230 align:middle line:10%
diet, because any time you're
cutting out simple sugars

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:11.133 align:middle line:10%
and high glycemic foods,
you're going to lose weight.

00:51:11.133 --> 00:51:12.640 align:middle line:90%
As simple as that.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Any anti-cancer diet is low
in sugar because we don't want

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.820 align:middle line:90%
to fuel the cancer cells, right?

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:22.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Otto Warburg told us in 1932
that cancer cells only thrive

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:24.450 align:middle line:10%
on simple sugars, not
complex carbohydrates,

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:26.910 align:middle line:10%
not fats or proteins.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was right then, but
conventional oncologists

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.470 align:middle line:90%
completely ignored that.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.470 align:middle line:10%
In fact, if you go
into any infusion

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.230 align:middle line:10%
center in any hospital
in the country,

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:39.160 align:middle line:10%
you'll see a big bowl of candy,
usually, and soft drinks.

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:39.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:45.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So they totally ignore the
properties of the cancer cell.

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Roby, would you talk
about the relationship between

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.060 align:middle line:90%
fat cells and cancers.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:52:00.270 align:middle line:10%
>> So fat cells, we have to
delineate normal fat cells from

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:04.680 align:middle line:10%
fat cells that are fat cells
because of the inflammatory

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.720 align:middle line:10%
process, all right?

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So, normal fat cells,
per se, are not

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.420 align:middle line:90%
necessarily carcinogenic.

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Inflammation is carcinogenic.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And what inflammation
is is basically

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.870 align:middle line:84%
a war between your immune
cells and some critter.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:29.470 align:middle line:84%
It can be a virus, it can be a
bacteria, it can be a fungus,

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:31.290 align:middle line:90%
it can be cancer.

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So, if you remember back to
the beginning of the Iraq

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.150 align:middle line:84%
War and that shock
and awe, that's

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:39.660 align:middle line:84%
very analogous to what
happens with the immune system

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:41.910 align:middle line:84%
when it's trying to fight
off a bacteria, virus,

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:44.020 align:middle line:90%
or fungus, to some degree.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So your immune system-- and
it's a very apropos analogy

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to compare the immune
system to the military,

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:54.210 align:middle line:84%
because you do have all
these different soldiers--

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:57.660 align:middle line:84%
T cells, and killer T cells,
and macrophages, and macrosites,

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.630 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, Kupffer
cells in the liver,

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and specialized cells in
each tissue in the body--

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that are sentinels that
are surveying the area.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And, then, if something goes
awry, then they let loose.

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And they have all these
weapons of mass destruction

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.540 align:middle line:90%
to make things happen.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So when your
temperature goes up,

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.070 align:middle line:84%
when you get red, when
you have diarrhea,

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:84%
when you have the sniffles and
the watery eyes and all that,

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.860 align:middle line:84%
so all of that is not
because of the critter.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.360 align:middle line:84%
That's because of
these chemicals

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.240 align:middle line:84%
that your immune system
is able to release.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was an emergency
room doctor before,

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.220 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you that
these chemicals are

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.970 align:middle line:84%
so powerful that they can kill
you very quickly in a process

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.787 align:middle line:90%
that we call anaphylactic shock.

00:53:40.787 --> 00:53:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you go into anaphylactic
shock-- and, again,

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.420 align:middle line:84%
that's a consequence of the
production of these weapons

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of mass destruction
of the immune system--

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.970 align:middle line:84%
you die very quickly if you're
not in my emergency room,

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:51.780 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.110 align:middle line:10%
So we have to respect
that the immune system has

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.120 align:middle line:10%
some really powerful weapons.

00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:03.270 align:middle line:10%
And, so, in a condition less
benign than anaphylactic shock

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:06.180 align:middle line:10%
where you've got a fever and
red and that type of thing,

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.700 align:middle line:10%
then it's just spitting
out some chemicals

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:12.480 align:middle line:10%
that make the environment
not so hospitable.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Not so hospitable
for the bacteria,

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.300 align:middle line:84%
but also not so hospitable
for human cells either.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what creates
that toxic situation

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.180 align:middle line:84%
that, over a long
period of time,

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:27.576 align:middle line:84%
the human cell will try
to protect itself from.

00:54:27.576 --> 00:54:28.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the things,
the chemicals,

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that is produced during
this inflammatory process

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.150 align:middle line:90%
are called growth factors.

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So growth factors have
an estrogenic effect,

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.067 align:middle line:84%
and estrogens, in general,
make cells go into what?

00:54:40.067 --> 00:54:41.900 align:middle line:84%
The hyperplasia that
we talked about before.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.910 align:middle line:84%
So making one cell faster
than normal, change to two,

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.850 align:middle line:90%
change to four, change to eight.

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Again, exponential
growth, right?

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So those fat cells
that are borne

00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:54.780 align:middle line:84%
of an inflammatory
situation, those then

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.340 align:middle line:84%
are linked to the
formation of cancer.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is a direct
relationship between fat cells

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.880 align:middle line:90%
and cancer.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Wow, that's fascinating
information.

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dr. Robert Scott Bell
is a gastrointestinal health

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:06.787 align:middle line:90%
specialist.

00:55:06.787 --> 00:55:08.620 align:middle line:84%
He understands the
immune system and the way

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.114 align:middle line:84%
that it's generated
in our gut, and so I

00:55:11.114 --> 00:55:13.780 align:middle line:84%
thought it was very important to
talk to him about this subject.

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:16.330 align:middle line:84%
A recurring theme that I'm
hearing from doctors that I've

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:20.916 align:middle line:84%
interviewed is cancer can't
exist if the immune system is

00:55:20.916 --> 00:55:21.790 align:middle line:90%
functioning properly.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> So talk about that.

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the toxins
impact the liver.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.820 align:middle line:10%
The liver is your main
organ for detoxification

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:29.380 align:middle line:10%
to bind and
eliminate and excrete

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.510 align:middle line:10%
through the colon as
solid waste or sending

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:33.610 align:middle line:10%
to the kidneys as
a liquid waste.

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:35.530 align:middle line:84%
If the liver is not
doing its job, of course,

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:38.104 align:middle line:84%
what gets to the
kidneys is often a form

00:55:38.104 --> 00:55:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that the kidneys can't
handle very well.

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:42.391 align:middle line:84%
And the toxins then
circulate through the system.

00:55:42.391 --> 00:55:44.890 align:middle line:84%
The body tries to find a way
to tuck it away somewhere else.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, a big way that we
interact with these toxins

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.620 align:middle line:84%
is through the gastrointestinal
tract, the alimentary canal.

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And these toxins are going
to impact on the microflora.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The microflora is the
seat of the immune system,

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.690 align:middle line:84%
along with the liver, but in
the intestines are 70% or so

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:00.710 align:middle line:90%
of the immune system is there.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we impact
our healthy flora,

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:05.440 align:middle line:84%
the good gut ecology,
we impact, negatively,

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.602 align:middle line:84%
our ability to have
a normal interaction

00:56:07.602 --> 00:56:08.560 align:middle line:90%
with the outside world.

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Because, technically, that
gastrointestinal tract,

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:13.820 align:middle line:84%
that alimentary canal,
from your mouth--

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.010 align:middle line:90%
and we get astrological.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:17.134 align:middle line:84%
I love to do this-- out
through the planet Uranus--

00:56:17.134 --> 00:56:18.500 align:middle line:90%
you get it?--

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.740 align:middle line:84%
you have this tube
that's technically

00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:22.870 align:middle line:84%
outside of your body,
even though it's in.

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:24.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the outside
environment carried through,

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and there's that barrier,
that epithelial barrier.

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:30.874 align:middle line:84%
That epithelial integrity
is critical to protect you

00:56:30.874 --> 00:56:32.290 align:middle line:84%
from things that
shouldn't get it,

00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:35.350 align:middle line:84%
including these toxic poisons,
or even metabolic waste.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And when that
barrier is corrupted

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.030 align:middle line:84%
via toxins, additives,
preservatives, colorings,

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:42.050 align:middle line:84%
flavorings,
pesticides, herbicides,

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:45.130 align:middle line:90%
fungicides, plastifiers, GMOs--

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:47.990 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified
ingredients-- and heavy metals,

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:51.220 align:middle line:84%
especially, like mercury,
you pierce that barrier.

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.230 align:middle line:84%
You impact, you
create inflammation,

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:54.940 align:middle line:90%
and now you have leaky gut.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.040 align:middle line:10%
And the bacteria
themselves are no longer

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:00.120 align:middle line:10%
in a hospitable environment,
so you have dysbiotic organisms

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:00.920 align:middle line:10%
growing.

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.890 align:middle line:84%
You have candida yeast
albicans overgrowth

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:04.510 align:middle line:90%
and different forms of candida.

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
things that go wrong,

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:08.230 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing that
we survive at all.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:10.174 align:middle line:84%
But that's a testament
to the creator,

00:57:10.174 --> 00:57:11.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, that
we've being created

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.669 align:middle line:84%
to withstand so much
assault. But we have a limit,

00:57:14.669 --> 00:57:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and that limit, of course,
is when the toxins overwhelm

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.209 align:middle line:90%
our ability to deal with them.

00:57:18.209 --> 00:57:20.410 align:middle line:84%
The accumulation can no
longer be held in check.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Then we have that dysregulation,
and these cells proliferate,

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and our immune system no longer
has the strength and integrity

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:28.570 align:middle line:84%
to be that barrier,
to fight it off,

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.160 align:middle line:84%
to keep it in check, because
of all these other things that

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:31.960 align:middle line:90%
occur--

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.680 align:middle line:84%
the liver toxins, the
intestinal toxins, et cetera.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:38.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is where the
immune system is corrupted.

00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:40.450 align:middle line:84%
The gut, primarily,
along with the liver.

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I always
start my focal point

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:44.230 align:middle line:84%
of healing for
anybody by working

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.760 align:middle line:90%
with the liver and the gut.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.666 align:middle line:84%
And then we are not even,
necessarily, chasing a symptom,

00:57:48.666 --> 00:57:50.290 align:middle line:84%
chasing a disease,
but we're correcting

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:54.100 align:middle line:84%
the terrain, the milieu or the
environment, at its source.

00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:58.090 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1908, Elie Metchnikoff
won a Nobel Prize in medicine

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.040 align:middle line:10%
for his work with
the immune system.

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.740 align:middle line:10%
He's considered the father
of modern immunology.

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.890 align:middle line:10%
And has worked with the
bacteria that makes yogurt.

00:58:05.890 --> 00:58:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said, death
begins in the colon.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And for many
patients, that's true.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And so what do we do?

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:18.220 align:middle line:84%
We give them narcotics,
that causes a slowing

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.430 align:middle line:90%
down of nerve impulses.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:21.029 align:middle line:84%
That's good, it
shuts down the pain.

00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It slows down the nerve
impulses that go to the muscles

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.530 align:middle line:84%
too, which now
causes constipation.

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:28.810 align:middle line:84%
If the patient had a
problem with dysbiosis,

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:31.540 align:middle line:84%
or a lack of proper
organisms in the gut,

00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.340 align:middle line:90%
it's going to get worse now.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So, I guess, modern
medicine needs to look,

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.562 align:middle line:84%
instead of this being
just a business--

00:58:38.562 --> 00:58:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's OK to make
money at health care,

00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:41.830 align:middle line:84%
as long as you're
helping people--

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:43.960 align:middle line:84%
but instead of it
just being a business,

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.370 align:middle line:84%
let's make it a business that
looks at underlying causes.

00:58:47.370 --> 00:58:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And instead of Mrs. Jones
the new diabetic saying,

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:52.930 align:middle line:90%
20 years worth of annuities.

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.590 align:middle line:84%
She's worth a
quarter of a million.

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:58.423 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can get
her out of diabetes.

00:58:58.423 --> 00:59:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if we can change
the underlying causes.

00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.887 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with cancer.

00:59:02.887 --> 00:59:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting perspective
from Dr. Quillin.

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.150 align:middle line:84%
He says that we need to get
to the underlying causes,

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:10.390 align:middle line:84%
and not just treat the symptoms,
when we're dealing with cancer.

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:12.490 align:middle line:84%
When I was recently
in Washington, DC,

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:14.770 align:middle line:84%
I was able to connect
with Dr. Sherri Tenpenny,

00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:16.540 align:middle line:90%
an expert on vaccines.

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Here's what she had to say.

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.920 align:middle line:90%
So, health it is not--

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.040 align:middle line:84%
health is an
inside-out phenomenon.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my phrase.

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:25.630 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what I
say all the time.

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:26.370 align:middle line:10%
>> That's where I got it.

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:27.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh.

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.835 align:middle line:10%
>> I read from your lectures.

00:59:28.835 --> 00:59:29.635 align:middle line:10%
>> That's good.

00:59:29.635 --> 00:59:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So health is an
inside-out phenomenon,

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.341 align:middle line:90%
which I've heard you say.

00:59:32.341 --> 00:59:35.235 align:middle line:84%
So, could you explain
what you mean by that?

00:59:35.235 --> 00:59:38.575 align:middle line:84%
Is bad health the result
of a lack of needles?

00:59:38.575 --> 00:59:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-- no.

00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And the opposite side of
that is, health does not

00:59:44.410 --> 00:59:46.380 align:middle line:90%
come through a needle.

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.250 align:middle line:90%
It just can't.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:49.210 align:middle line:84%
We just can't, in any
way, think that we're

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:52.045 align:middle line:84%
going to inject something into
a little baby, or an adult,

00:59:52.045 --> 00:59:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that in any way is going to
positively impact their health.

00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So health is an
inside-out phenomenon.

00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.710 align:middle line:84%
You have an intact immune
system, good nutrition,

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:03.950 align:middle line:84%
adequate organs of
detoxification-- liver, kidney,

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:05.050 align:middle line:90%
colon, skin.

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:06.970 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
come out easily.

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.290 align:middle line:84%
You've got all the appropriate
nutrients in there--

01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:11.800 align:middle line:84%
your B vitamins,
vitamin D, vitamin C--

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.732 align:middle line:84%
all the appropriate
things that you need,

01:00:13.732 --> 01:00:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that you could be
swimming in bugs.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:16.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sitting in
this room right here,

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.550 align:middle line:84%
how many bugs do you
think are in the air

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:21.432 align:middle line:84%
in this massive hotel,
in the carpeting.

01:00:21.432 --> 01:00:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you live on a farm, and
you're going out and petting

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:26.380 align:middle line:84%
animals and all of
that, you are not

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.780 align:middle line:84%
succumbing to all of these
viruses and bacteria that

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.900 align:middle line:84%
are around you if you are
healthy from the inside out,

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and your immune system does
what God intended it to do

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and what we were
humanly designed to be.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.350 align:middle line:90%


01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:42.460 align:middle line:84%
A fascinating quote
by Dr. Tenpenny there.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.966 align:middle line:84%
Health is an
inside-out phenomenon.

01:00:44.966 --> 01:00:46.090 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to agree with her.

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be
healthy on the inside.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.770 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, health is not going
to be expressed on the outside.

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So how do we stay
healthy on the inside?

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:53.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.720 align:middle line:84%
While we were filming
this episode, actually--

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm good friends with all
of the production team

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that's with me here
in the studio--

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
one of them asked me, he said,
Ty, how many of your relatives

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.981 align:middle line:84%
that died of cancer
do you think died

01:01:03.981 --> 01:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%
from environmental toxicity?

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.250 align:middle line:84%
How many of them
was caused by that,

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:09.670 align:middle line:90%
by environmental toxicity?

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I told him, I think
probably all of them,

01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:14.130 align:middle line:84%
all seven close family
members that I've lost

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
were due to
environmental toxicity.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is in line with the
American Cancer Society's web

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:19.150 align:middle line:90%
site.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
If you go there,
there's a document

01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:23.440 align:middle line:84%
called Cancer Facts and
Figures that you can download.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And in that document it says
that up to 95% of all cancers

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.230 align:middle line:84%
are caused by
environmental toxins.

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So it seems pretty important
to learn about toxicity, to me,

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and in light of the fact that
most people that die of cancer

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
die because the cancer
got a hold of their body

01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:39.154 align:middle line:90%
because their body was toxic.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So tomorrow night we're
going to learn about toxins.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.778 align:middle line:84%
We are going to learn about
these environmental toxins that

01:01:43.778 --> 01:01:45.200 align:middle line:90%
invade your body--

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
whether it be through vaccines,
or genetically modified foods,

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
or pesticides on your food,
fluoride in the water,

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
whatever the toxin
source may be--

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that compromised
that immune system

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.939 align:middle line:84%
that we learned about
tonight and make your body

01:01:56.939 --> 01:01:58.270 align:middle line:90%
more susceptible to cancer.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
This is incredibly
valuable information.

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to miss
tomorrow night's episode.

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:04.150 align:middle line:84%
It could literally
save your life.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I hope enjoyed
this episode, and I

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:06.610 align:middle line:90%
hope you have a great evening.

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:07.620 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:18.260 align:middle line:90%


01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:19.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I'm here with Wayne.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.950 align:middle line:10%
And Wayne is going
to give us his story

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:24.830 align:middle line:10%
of being diagnosed with cancer
and tell us what he did.

01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:29.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, Ty, my story
started in 2010.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.510 align:middle line:10%
I was diagnosed with
prostate cancer.

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:37.402 align:middle line:84%
And, like everybody
else, I wasn't sure

01:02:37.402 --> 01:02:38.360 align:middle line:90%
what I was going to do.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I did know I wasn't going to do
anything on the medical side.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I had gone to an oncologist
who did a physical on me

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and ordered a biopsy,
which I declined.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I ended up doing,
I flew to California

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to a wellness center, took a
week of education on health

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and tried to get my head
around what was going on,

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.080 align:middle line:90%
why I had this cancer.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And they taught me a lot about
diet and some of the things

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that was going on my
body, the imbalances.

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I had them order or an
MRI and an MRS for me

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
so I could get a
handle on the cancer,

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:15.350 align:middle line:90%
making sure it was contained.

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:19.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a stage 2 cancer, and it
was contained in my prostate.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.670 align:middle line:84%
I come back home,
and I searched out

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
two people I had
heard that had dealt

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.870 align:middle line:90%
with their cancer on their own.

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And through some information I
got from one of the two people,

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:34.010 align:middle line:90%
I got Bill Henderson's name.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:36.710 align:middle line:84%
I got his book, and
I contacted Bill--

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
after I read his book--
if he would be a coach

01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:40.880 align:middle line:90%
and direct me through this.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And I followed the protocols
of Bill, which is basically,

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:46.380 align:middle line:90%
I dealt with my dental issues.

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I completely changed my diet.

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I didn't
do, till a couple of years

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
later, was deal with
the emotional issues.

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But the other two issues
were enough to look

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.810 align:middle line:90%
after the cancer for myself.

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was about eight months
after, I was cancer-free.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And since that time,
that was in late 2011,

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:12.380 align:middle line:84%
I have been working
with a number of people

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
up in my area that have
done exactly the same thing.

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people with
more advanced stage cancers

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.840 align:middle line:84%
than I had have
done the same thing.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I've had people
with stage 3 and up

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to stage 4 cancer
that, within a year,

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.310 align:middle line:84%
have done exactly
the same thing.

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So I would tell people,
educate yourself.

01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:39.050 align:middle line:10%
Take the time to find out what
you need to do for yourself.

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:40.940 align:middle line:10%
You always get
pushed, like I did,

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.760 align:middle line:10%
that you've got to do
something right away.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.340 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people, tell
your doctor, I need a time out.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.020 align:middle line:90%
I want to educate myself.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And then make a decision
that you feel is right.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
So, all the best.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.730 align:middle line:90%
