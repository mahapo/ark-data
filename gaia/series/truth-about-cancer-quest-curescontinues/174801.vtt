00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "The Quest
for the Cures Continues."

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.114 align:middle line:84%
My name is Ty Bollinger, and
I'm going to be your host.

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:30.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that
you've tuned in tonight

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:84%
because this program,
this docuseries,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.725 align:middle line:90%
for the next 11 days is for you.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're just
trying to prevent cancer,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
whether you have a loved
one or a child with cancer,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.851 align:middle line:84%
or whether you've been
personally diagnosed

00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:84%
with cancer, you deserve to
know all of your options.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
If you remember
back in the spring,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
we aired "The Quest
for the Cures"

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
in which I traveled
across the country

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
interviewing doctors and
researchers and cancer patients

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:84%
to find out exactly what
they are doing to treat

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:90%
their cancer, naturally.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Because of your support,
we've continued our journey

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
and traveled to Houston, Frisco,
LA, Washington, DC, Detroit,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
all across the USA and
interviewed another 22 doctors

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:90%
and scientists.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
We now have 51 of the
most renowned doctors,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.465 align:middle line:84%
scientists, and survivors
who are breaking

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
their code of
silence and will be

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:84%
sharing with you,
these next 11 days,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.734 align:middle line:84%
about natural
treatments for cancer.

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And we've learned
more information

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
about these natural treatments
that mitigate cancer.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.980 align:middle line:84%
According to the World
Health Organization,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
one in two men and
one in three women

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
alive today will face
a cancer diagnosis.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I lost my entire
family to cancer.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
In 1996, my father,
Graham Bollinger,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:84%
was diagnosed with
stomach cancer.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
He was 52 years old, and he died
in 25 days from the surgery.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.540 align:middle line:84%
After that, my grandfather,
my uncle, my cousin,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.600 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother, another
grandfather, and then

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:84%
eventually my mother,
in 2004, died of cancer.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm doing what I'm
doing because of them.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.450 align:middle line:84%
My passion is to share
this information with you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:84%
so that you can be able to make
an informed decision if you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:90%
face that cancer diagnosis.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:90%

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.620 align:middle line:84%
The time came where I
had to leave my family,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and it was such a blessing
because they completely

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:90%
supported me in this mission.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't my mission,
it was our mission.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.894 align:middle line:84%
It was my wife's, it
was my children's.

00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:21.147 align:middle line:90%
We all shared this mission.

00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And, so, while it was painful
to be separated from them,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
it was something that
was necessary in order

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish this goal.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.444 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a
bittersweet time when

00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:84%
I had to say goodbye
to my family,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
but we knew that our goal, that
our purpose was much greater

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.489 align:middle line:90%
than this.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.934 align:middle line:90%

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
When my dad was
diagnosed with cancer,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't understand
how a man that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
was seemingly healthy at 52
years old could die in 25 days

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:90%
after the surgery.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand how
modern medicine could still

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
be operating in what
seemed like the Dark Ages.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they are Dark Ages.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:10%
In medicine, we are beginning
to have Dark Ages unless people

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:10%
will take some action.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it that we're
living in the Dark Ages?

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Could it be because of
medical school curriculum?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I traveled down the
road to Seguin, Texas,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.654 align:middle line:84%
to talk to my college
roommate, Dr. Irvin Sahni.

00:03:26.654 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:10%
>> So talk about med school.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.361 align:middle line:10%
When you went through
medical school,

00:03:29.361 --> 00:03:31.660 align:middle line:10%
how much nutritional
training did you get?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty much none.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:90%
[TAPE REWIND NOISE]

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Pretty much none.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty much none?

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
How can it be that
doctors receive

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:84%
almost no education on
nutrition and diet while

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:90%
in medical school?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Could Dr. Sahni be the
only one with this story?

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:10%
>> In medical school, we have
like 30 minutes of nutrition

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:10%
where they tell us-- don't
give sugar to the diabetic,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:10%
don't give salt to the
hypertensive patient,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:10%
and give a lot of fiber to
those that are constipated.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's it.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.111 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what they taught you?

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:02.302 align:middle line:84%
>> So doctors don't know
anything about nutrition.

00:04:02.302 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> No one's interested in
talking to you about losing

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.840 align:middle line:90%
weight.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
No one's interested in talking
to you about quitting smoking.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.879 align:middle line:90%
We do that a little bit.

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually codes
for quitting smoking.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
There's some little
fine nuances there.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:10%
But the bottom line is,
there's no real incentive

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:10%
to promote true health,
and there is an incentive

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:10%
to write lots of
prescription medications

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:10%
by the way the
system is designed.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> A common theme
that I'm hearing--

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
medical doctors, while
brilliant people,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.709 align:middle line:84%
are just not taught about
nutrition and overall health

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:90%
when they're in medical school.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.480 align:middle line:84%
They're basically taught to
prescribe a pill for every ill.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.707 align:middle line:90%
Why is this so?

00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
In order to get the
answer to that question,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.180 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to go
back in time, about 100 years,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.055 align:middle line:90%
for a history lesson.

00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:49.221 align:middle line:84%
You see, if we're going to
change where we're going,

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:50.750 align:middle line:84%
we need to know
where we've been.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's why history
is so important.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Because, as the old saying goes,
those who don't know history

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:90%
are doomed to repeat it.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I had to talk to
Dr. Robert Scott

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Bell who's a homeopathic
doctor and also a historian.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It was time to begin
our history lesson.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I saw you recently
on "Fox News."

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:84%
You talked about a monopoly
of modern medicine.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And you went into the
history of modern medicine.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> If you could, for
the viewers here,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:84%
go into a brief five-minute
history of modern medicine.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
How did we get to
where we are today?

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, this is an
interesting thing,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:90%
the history that is not taught.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:10%
And part of my interest
in this subject,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:10%
not only because
of my own health

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:10%
challenges, but once
I uncovered the fact

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:10%
that I was lied to about
my health and my body

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:10%
and health and
medicine in general,

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:10%
I began to question just about
everything that I was taught.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And as I uncovered these
different areas of inquiry,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.521 align:middle line:84%
I found out indeed there
is an official story

00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:84%
about these things,
including the official story

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:90%
of modern medicine.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.798 align:middle line:84%
We're raised as if
it's always been here,

00:05:45.798 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:84%
it's always been this
way, and the only doctors

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.240 align:middle line:84%
you could consult
are medical doctors

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.374 align:middle line:84%
that prescribe patent medicines
approved by the Federal Food

00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and Drug Administration--
that are often

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.123 align:middle line:84%
called the Fear and Death
Administration-- because

00:05:57.123 --> 00:05:59.970 align:middle line:84%
of the promotion of products
that are, in fact, the leading

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:90%
cause of death.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.436 align:middle line:84%
Not the third, or
second, but the first,

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
in fact, when you start
taking it all into account.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So looking back at the
history, I became intrigued

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:90%
as to how did we get here?

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And that opened up
a huge can of worms.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a homeopath,
eventually I became,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I learned about many
things in history

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:90%
that we were not taught.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.627 align:middle line:84%
Even, including the fact
that in the Civil War,

00:06:21.627 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
the war between the states--
some describe it as the War

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.126 align:middle line:84%
of Northern Aggression,
depending on your historical

00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:27.140 align:middle line:90%
perspective--

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:84%
you would go, even today, you
would go to a Civil War Museum

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.295 align:middle line:84%
in the south, and
it is fascinating

00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that you will find
in the medical field

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:84%
kits, the little kits that
they have, first aid kits,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.820 align:middle line:84%
they all had homeopathic
medicine in there.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:10%
I was steeped in the tradition,
growing up a lot of my years

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.740 align:middle line:10%
in the south in the Civil
War, never once did we ever

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:10%
acknowledge that
there was anything

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.116 align:middle line:10%
like that in these kits,
much less herbal medicine.

00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a whole
history that was hidden from me.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, eventually I was
introduced to Harris Coulter.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.041 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a series of books
called "Divided Legacy."

00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are books
you could work out with.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.070 align:middle line:84%
You could become
big like you, Ty.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
incredible the history

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
that was hidden from us about
the schism between what we call

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.420 align:middle line:84%
homeopathic and
naturopathic thought

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
forms versus allopathic
thought forms,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
where they poison the body using
mercury and different things.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's where Dr.
Samuel Hahnemann, who

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:84%
was a physician in his
day in the late 18th

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.519 align:middle line:84%
and early 19th
century, determined

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that the medicine that he
was giving his patients

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.344 align:middle line:84%
was more harmful
than the disease.

00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't stomach
that, and that's

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:84%
where he was motivated to
develop a system that became--

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:84%
well, a broad-based
worldwide system

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
called homeopathy, utilizing
small quantities or amounts

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
of naturally
occurring substances

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
from the mineral, animal,
and plant kingdoms.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And, in this way,
there was a growth

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
around the world out of Germany
of this new form of medicine.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, eventually,
there was a schism

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:84%
because there was an
emerging field of what

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
we call patent petrochemical
medicines based

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
on the Rockefeller-type oil
monopoly that had already

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.464 align:middle line:84%
established in the energy
sector that was growing.

00:07:54.464 --> 00:07:56.630 align:middle line:84%
They started finding out,
through organic chemistry,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
that they can alter
these oil-based molecules

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:90%
into all kinds of things.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And they developed
these patented drugs,

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:90%
or drug molecules.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Bell talked about
pharmaceutical drugs

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.826 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that doctors lean
heavily towards prescribing

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:10.050 align:middle line:90%
drugs.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Why is this?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go get the
opinion of another well-known

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:84%
researcher, so I traveled
out to California

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:84%
to speak to a prominent
historian, G. Edward Griffin,

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and get his take on the
history of modern medicine

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.581 align:middle line:84%
and the American
Medical Association.

00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you
mentioned the fact

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:84%
that we've got the
pharmaceutical industry,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
we've got an industry
driven by money.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And we've got doctors that
are really smart people today,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.700 align:middle line:90%
brilliant medical doctors.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:84%
They're using treatments that
really don't seem to work

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as some of
these natural things.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Why is it?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Can you go back into the history
of the Medical Association,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:84%
the American Medical
Association, AMA,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and maybe take us back 100
years and stairstep people

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:84%
to current day and
explain why that is.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Because I've heard you talk
about this in the past,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.386 align:middle line:84%
and your explanation
is fascinating.

00:08:58.386 --> 00:09:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I want the listeners to
be able to hear this.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.426 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you for that.

00:09:01.426 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:10%
It is a fascinating story.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:10%
It's an important story.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:10%
And I suppose we don't have
time to go into all of it,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:10%
but maybe the best way here
is to kind of back into it

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:10%
to start with where we
are and then go back

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:10%
and see how we got there.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Where we are today is that,
just as you described,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.020 align:middle line:90%
these very smart doctors--

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:84%
let's face it, there is a
very selective process there.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
You just don't get
into med school

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.700 align:middle line:84%
unless you've got a pretty good
brain on top of your shoulders

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:32.720 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's the cream of the crop.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:84%
The best students go into these
schools, these medical schools,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.640 align:middle line:84%
but they're not taught
anything about natural cures.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:84%
They're taught only about drugs,
primarily, and drug reactions

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and the chemistry of this
and the chemistry of that.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And they have to become
really pharmacists, in a way.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
They have to become chemists
before they can even

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:90%
make it through pre-med.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that's not necessarily
bad, but it is a bias.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And I have come to
know a lot of doctors

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple of
decades since we've

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:84%
been working in this
field, many doctors who

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.700 align:middle line:84%
came from that
layer of education

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
and who gradually and
sometimes very painfully

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.590 align:middle line:84%
had to break away from that
and go back and re-examine some

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:90%
of these fundamental issues.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And many of them have
made the transition

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and they speak quite
openly about it now.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:84%
For instance, they will say,
when I went to medical school,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
we never learned
anything about vitamins,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:84%
except we had maybe two
hours of instruction

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:84%
on the structures of vitamins
and minerals and so forth.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Two hours compared to
hundreds and hundreds

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
of hours about pharmacies
and chemical reactions

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, there
was one doctor who said,

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, my wife knows
more about nutrition

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:84%
than I did when I
came out of school.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is not
surprising when you

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
realize-- now we start
to go backward in time,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:90%
how did that happen?

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.870 align:middle line:84%
The fact that these great
medical teaching universities

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and teaching
centers are so great

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
is because they've had a
lot of money given to them.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Where did the money come from?

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:90%
Now we're on the trail.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
You know the old
saying, follow the money

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.747 align:middle line:84%
and usually that will
take you right to it.

00:11:17.747 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you follow the money,
you'll find out that most of it

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
came from the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:84%
The pharmaceutical
industry knows

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.615 align:middle line:84%
that if they give large
grants to these universities,

00:11:29.615 --> 00:11:30.740 align:middle line:90%
they have a double benefit.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.870 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they
have the appearance

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.420 align:middle line:90%
of being philanthropists.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
They're doing good
things, and that's always

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.860 align:middle line:90%
good for public relations.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that they're
not doing good things.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:90%
They probably think they are.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But, anyway, that's
one advantage

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.650 align:middle line:84%
to giving tax-exempt
or tax-free deductible

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:90%
donations to universities.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But the other advantage
is far more important.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:10%
Because once you have
financed a research project,

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:10%
you now have a first
right to whatever

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:10%
comes out of that research.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And, consequently, you
can determine in what

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.020 align:middle line:90%
areas the research will go.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I can assure you that if I'm
a big pharmaceutical company

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and I give a $20 million
grant to a research group,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be
very happy if they start

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
to research whether or
not dandelions can be

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:90%
used in the control of cancer.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure they're
going to research a drug

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:84%
that I am working on in
the laboratories right now.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.670 align:middle line:84%
That's where I want
the research to go.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So they realize that they can
take their own research budget

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and transfer it to a university,
or some research laboratory,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.934 align:middle line:84%
and get a tax deduction
for it, knowing full well

00:12:45.934 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:84%
that if that's what
they're researching,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:84%
that's what the
data is going to be.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need
to go any further.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:90%
You can understand.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:84%
When the money is coming
from a source, which

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
has a vested interest
in the outcome,

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
now what's going to
happen is the outcome

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
is going to be what the donor
wants it to be, generally.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.840 align:middle line:90%
So this is the problem.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back
even further in time

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:14.120 align:middle line:84%
to the turn of the last
century when the Rockefeller

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Group and the Carnegie Group
actually came together,

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and they decided that they
would reform medical education

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:24.980 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>> This sounded like
an altruistic plan,

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to reform medical
school education.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But could there be a
more insidious purpose

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:90%
behind the whole thing?

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.185 align:middle line:84%
>> At the time of the late
1800s, the early 1990s,

00:13:36.185 --> 00:13:39.367 align:middle line:84%
the 20th century, medical
schools taught a lot

00:13:39.367 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:90%
of different things.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
There were homeopathic
medical schools,

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.520 align:middle line:84%
there were naturopathic
schools, there

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:84%
were eclectic herbal-type
medicine schools,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and so it was all there.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:90%
There was not one way.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.620 align:middle line:10%
Then what happened was that
the Rockefeller and Carnegie

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:10%
Foundations were interested
in establishing the one way.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.026 align:middle line:10%
How would they do that?

00:13:57.026 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, they would get a hold
of the education system

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and create a medical monopoly
by basically eliminating

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
all competition to
patent petrochemical

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:90%
medical education.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:84%
That's the Flexner Report
of 1910, it became known.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Abraham and Simon Flexner
were hired to do this.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a preordained
commission report.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Not surprisingly, the basis
of the report was that it was

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:10%
far too easy to start
a medical school,

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:10%
and that most schools were
not teaching sound medicine.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:90%
Let me translate this for you.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
These natural health
colleges were not

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.690 align:middle line:84%
pushing enough chemical
drugs manufactured by who?

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Carnegie and Rockefeller.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The AMA, who were evaluating
the various medical colleges,

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
made it their job to target and
shut down the larger respected

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:90%
homeopathic colleges.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:10%
Carnegie and Rockefeller
began to immediately shower

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:10%
hundreds of millions of dollars
on these medical schools

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:10%
that were teaching
drug-intensive medicine.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, by the way, when
they donated the money,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.240 align:middle line:10%
the donors would say, well, now
we've given you a lot of money,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:10%
and we know you're going to
do the right thing with it,

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:10%
but would you object if we
had someone from our staff

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:10%
appointed to your board of
directors just to make sure

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:10%
that our, just to see how
our money is being spent?

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was really a
condition of getting the money,

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
so you know the university
said, well, that would be fine.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that you would
suggest would be,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure, more than adequate.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.530 align:middle line:84%
So they began to load up
the boards of directors

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:84%
of these teaching centers
with people who literally were

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:90%
on the payroll of the donors.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So once that was in
place, the curriculum

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of the universities,
the teaching centers,

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
swung completely
in the direction

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:90%
of pharmaceutical drugs.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And it has remained
that way ever since.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Predictably, those schools
that had the financing,

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.080 align:middle line:10%
churned out the better doctors.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:10%
Oh, wait a minute.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:10%
Or should I say, the
more recognized doctors.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.610 align:middle line:84%
In return for the
financing, the schools

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:84%
were required to continue
teaching course material that

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.510 align:middle line:84%
was exclusively drug-oriented
with no emphasis

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:90%
on natural medicine.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
By 1925, over 10,000 herbalists
were out of business.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.770 align:middle line:84%
By 1940, over
1,500 chiropractors

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.870 align:middle line:84%
would be prosecuted for
practicing quackery.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.000 align:middle line:84%
The 22 homeopathic
medical schools

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:84%
that flourished in the 1900s
dwindled down to just two

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:90%
by 1923.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
By 1950, all the schools
teaching homeopathy

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:90%
were closed.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.570 align:middle line:84%
In the end, if a
physician did not

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
graduate from a
Flexner-approved medical school

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and receive an MD
degree, then he or she

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:90%
could not find a job anywhere.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:10%
This is why, today, MDs
are so heavily biased

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:10%
towards synthetic drug
therapy and know little

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:10%
about nutrition, if anything.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, this whole medical
field has been skewed

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:10%
in the direction of
pharmaceutical drugs which can

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:10%
be patented and produce great
profits for the producers.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the next step is
that means that anything

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:90%
coming from nature is excluded.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.869 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
think, some of us think,

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:27.069 align:middle line:84%
that most of the promised
lies and these very

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
complex substances found in
herbs and plants and trees

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
seeds, some of us

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:84%
feel that it was probably
meant to be that way.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And so you come out of
all of this analysis

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and all of this history
with the realization

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
that the medical
profession is really

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
like a lapdog of the
pharmaceutical industry.

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And most of the doctors have
no idea that that's the case.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
this history.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, what an
awesome history lesson.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Now we're beginning to
connect the dots, aren't we,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.940 align:middle line:90%
about modern medicine?

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a business.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Listen to what Dr. Patrick
Quillin has to say.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to admit that health
care is a business in America.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.170 align:middle line:10%
And while we would all
hope that all hospitals

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:10%
and all clinicians
are working feverishly

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.030 align:middle line:10%
to get the patient
well, in fact,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.900 align:middle line:10%
they're a vested interest in
this business of health care.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a $2.7 trillion a year
medical industrial complex

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:90%
we have in America.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.280 align:middle line:84%
That's one out of seven
health care dollars are spent.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And one might argue
that a lot of that

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
has nothing to do with
health or care or prevention.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
That much of it is symptom
management using drugs

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:90%
and surgery to manage symptoms.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
A patient comes in with a
list of problems and symptoms

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:90%
and pain.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:84%
The doctor has seven minutes
to review the symptoms

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and prescribe a drug and
move on to the next patient.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.040 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, well here's a pill
for your blood pressure,

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.665 align:middle line:10%
and here's a pill
for your cholesterol,

00:18:57.665 --> 00:18:59.560 align:middle line:10%
and here here's a pill
for your back pain.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:10%
And I'll see you in
a month, and we'll

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:10%
see if you're
maintaining your disease.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's what doctors do.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:84%
They maintain a
person's illness.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:90%
They're not making them better.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what are you doing?

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:90%
That is not OK.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to create
optimal health in people.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
That's your job.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Doctor means to teach.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't you
teaching your patients

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.952 align:middle line:90%
how to turn their life around?

00:19:23.952 --> 00:19:26.035 align:middle line:10%
>> So one other thing I
would like to say is that,

00:19:26.035 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:10%
even with our Hippocratic Oath,
which most physicians have

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:10%
never read, the first thing
it says-- first do no harm.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.016 align:middle line:10%
And we have to always
go back in saying, well,

00:19:35.016 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:10%
are we doing harm, number one?

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.725 align:middle line:10%
Number two, is it
also says, just

00:19:37.725 --> 00:19:39.641 align:middle line:10%
further down in the
Hippocratic Oath is that--

00:19:39.641 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:10%
I will not give a
poison, a deadly poison.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:10%
And most of the drugs
that we give, particularly

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.994 align:middle line:10%
in oncological care,
has a black box warning,

00:19:44.994 --> 00:19:48.230 align:middle line:10%
which means that more people
often end up in the black box

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.030 align:middle line:10%
from taking it.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:49.990 align:middle line:10%
So you can take this
sort of treatment

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:10%
and you might get
immediate results,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:10%
but you also can
have another cancer

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:10%
or have a severe reaction or
have a life threatening illness

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:10%
from that treatment.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.900 align:middle line:10%
So just from that in
itself, almost everything

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.880 align:middle line:10%
that we do in oncology,
I go back to my oath

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.215 align:middle line:10%
and say, well, I
look at everything.

00:20:02.215 --> 00:20:03.881 align:middle line:10%
Even if it's herb, I
still challenge it.

00:20:03.881 --> 00:20:05.690 align:middle line:10%
I go, is this going
to cause harm or not?

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.510 align:middle line:10%
And if it does, then we have
to look at other options

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:10%
available.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.520 align:middle line:10%
>> When we graduate
from medical school,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.061 align:middle line:10%
we take the Hippocratic Oath,
which says in part-- above all,

00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:12.880 align:middle line:10%
do no harm.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:10%
And I can tell you, a lot
of conventional therapies

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:10%
are harmful and
toxic to the body,

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.694 align:middle line:10%
and they don't prolong life or
improve the quality of life.

00:20:20.694 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not quite sure how we've
gotten stuck into this rat

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
hole, but I think we've
gotten stuck into it from,

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned, what I've
written about that cancer

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.470 align:middle line:90%
industrial complex.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It's set up to feed itself
with more and more money

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.130 align:middle line:90%
than it needs.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Brownstein mentioned
the cancer industrial complex.

00:20:36.386 --> 00:20:38.260 align:middle line:84%
He also mentioned that
conventional therapies

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
are more harmful to the
body than they are helpful.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Could this be?

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Could it possibly be so?

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
What were cancer
rates 100 years ago?

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any idea?

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk to Burton
Goldberg, also known

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
as The Voice of
Alternative Medicine,

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:84%
who was featured in Suzanne
Summers' book "Knockout."

00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>> When my daddy
was born in 1900,

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.310 align:middle line:84%
one in 33 Americans had cancer
of any kind, shape, or form.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:10%
When I was born in 1926,
cancer was the tenth cause

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:10%
of death in children.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Today, it's the first cause
of death, before accidents.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> What's going on?

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:90%
There's a Holocaust.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not a question
of will I have cancer,

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.177 align:middle line:90%
it's a question of when.

00:21:24.177 --> 00:21:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And the oncologists are
keeping their mouths shut.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:84%
They use the chemo,
they use the radiation,

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and radiation causes cancer.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Mammograms cause
cancer, we know that.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Medical research and
medical journals prove it,

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:90%
and yet they still do it.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, thermography
and ultrasound

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:84%
can be very beneficial
without the violent side

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:90%
effects of annual mammograms.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:90%
And squeezing the breast.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Guess what happens if
there's a tumor there?

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.755 align:middle line:84%
You're squeezing it
through the body.

00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:02.555 align:middle line:90%
It's insanity.

00:22:02.555 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> They spread it.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So the medical
profession, in my opinion,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:84%
is as corrupt as any
third-world nation.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.480 align:middle line:90%
And this country is allowing it.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
it's allowing it is

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
because subsequent to the
Roosevelt administration,

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:27.500 align:middle line:84%
the agencies that were
designed to protect humanity

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
are protecting the
industries they're

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.097 align:middle line:90%
supposed to protect us from.

00:22:31.097 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, did you hear that last
statement from Burton Goldberg?

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
The agencies that are supposed
to be protecting humanity

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
are now protecting
the industries

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.580 align:middle line:84%
that they should be
protecting us from?

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:90%
What about the FDA?

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Are they a member of that group
that Burton's talking about?

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, isn't the FDA supposed
to protect us from food

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:90%
and drugs that are tainted?

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.147 align:middle line:84%
I traveled to Houston, Texas, to
talk to Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski

00:22:52.147 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
who's been heavily persecuted
by the Texas Medical

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Board and the FDA.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:84%
In this next clip, he talks
about how they retroactively

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:84%
changed the law to entrap
him to make it appear that he

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:90%
was actually breaking the law.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:84%
When in reality, the law wasn't
even in place at the time.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:10%
>> They went after us, OK?

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:10%
They began to harass
us, obviously.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.170 align:middle line:10%
And they wanted
to get rid of us.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:10%
Because, obviously,
after they found

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.070 align:middle line:10%
that we have
something which works,

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.710 align:middle line:10%
it became a serious
threat too big pharma.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely, they were
clients of the big pharma.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:10%
Why they would
introduce a law which

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:10%
would say this is only big
pharmaceutical companies

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:10%
with unlimited resources
is allowed to do it.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.280 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, it shows
whom they serve.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:10%
They don't serve
the American people.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.650 align:middle line:10%
They serve big pharma.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps some investigative
reporter can really deal with

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:10%
them and prove their corruption
and clear this up because some

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:10%
things cannot exist.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:10%
They are suffocating
research and they are working

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.620 align:middle line:10%
against medical researchers.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:10%
Because of them, many
people are dying.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.190 align:middle line:10%
And these are the
guys who really

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:10%
should be the guardians of
what is good in medicine.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:10%
So I would call it
the Sovietization

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.220 align:middle line:10%
of the United States.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.540 align:middle line:10%
So they borrowed the
idea from Comrade Stalin

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:10%
how to really restrict
freedom of the people.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sovietization
of the United States?

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Spoken by a man who immigrated
from a communist country?

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the FDA should be
protecting what's good,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I agree with Dr. Burzynski,
but are they really?

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.920 align:middle line:84%
In September, 2014, I was
privileged to attend the Sacred

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.734 align:middle line:84%
Fire of Liberty Gala
in Washington, DC,

00:24:24.734 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and I met up with Jonathan
Emord, who's an attorney.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.940 align:middle line:84%
He's known as the
FDA Dragon Slayer,

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.939 align:middle line:84%
and I got his opinion on
this very important topic.

00:24:31.939 --> 00:24:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, this was an
impromptu interview.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
The sound's not
really all that great.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.551 align:middle line:84%
There was a band playing
in the background,

00:24:36.551 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
so we've closed
captioned it for you.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.700 align:middle line:10%
I recently interviewed Dr.
Stanislaw Burzynski in Houston.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.330 align:middle line:84%
He talked about the way that he
has been attacked by the FDA.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.420 align:middle line:10%
Why is it that the
FDA goes after people

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:10%
that are using natural
treatments for cancer,

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:10%
but they openly admit
on their own website

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:10%
that their approved drugs
kill 100,000 people a year?

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.560 align:middle line:10%
What's the disconnect?

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there's nothing
more disgusting, frankly,

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:05.220 align:middle line:10%
but certainly a gross abuse
of individual liberty to have

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.690 align:middle line:10%
the government stand in
the way of your access,

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:10%
when you're dying, to a
experimental treatment that

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.820 align:middle line:10%
could save your life.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:10%
It really is amazing
to me that in the land

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.146 align:middle line:10%
that was supposed to be
dedicated first and foremost

00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:22.652 align:middle line:10%
to individual liberty,
that you could

00:25:22.652 --> 00:25:26.396 align:middle line:10%
have the government, our own,
standing in the way of people

00:25:26.396 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:10%
who desperately need an
alternative to failed

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.230 align:middle line:10%
conventional treatments.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:10%
And that's what our
government does.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a travesty.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's really, when you
think of the number of people

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:10%
who have died or have suffered
immeasurably because of it, you

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.935 align:middle line:10%
want to hold those
responsible to account,

00:25:43.935 --> 00:25:46.390 align:middle line:10%
and yet they're protected
by sovereign immunity

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:10%
from being prosecuted,
despite the fact that they are

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:10%
very directly
responsible for taking

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.770 align:middle line:10%
the lives of these people,
by denying them the freedom

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:10%
to choose an alternative
that works for them.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Denying the people the right
to choose a treatment that

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:90%
works for them.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.056 align:middle line:84%
This shouldn't be happening
in America today, but it is.

00:26:05.056 --> 00:26:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Right down the
road from my house

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is a food scientist
named Mike Adams.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
He's also known as
The Health Ranger.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what he has to say
about the topic of censorship

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and the FDA's official
position on supplements.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a system of
censorship of nutritional

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:10%
knowledge.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:10%
There is a system that's
trying to extinguish

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.320 align:middle line:10%
indigenous knowledge
of anti-cancer herbs

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:10%
and medicines,
foods and nutrition.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And the predominant messages
that we are told in society

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.572 align:middle line:84%
today is that foods
cannot be medicine,

00:26:37.572 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:90%
that's what they claim.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.879 align:middle line:84%
>> That there's no such
thing as medicinal herbs.

00:26:40.879 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:84%
The FDA's official
position is that there's

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as a
dietary supplement that

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.650 align:middle line:84%
has any effect on preventing
or treating disease.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Their position is that you
are not a complete human

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.530 align:middle line:84%
being unless you have
interventionist chemical

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.120 align:middle line:90%
medicine or vaccines.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You must be injected, you
must be dosed with medications

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.280 align:middle line:90%
to be a complete human being.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
That message is the antithesis
of the natural world.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:84%
It is the antithesis
of natural living

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and holistic medicine,
holistic healing.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:16.390 align:middle line:84%
We, Ty, we are spontaneous
self-healing beings

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
that are programmed,
from that day we're born,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to heal ourselves if we give
our bodies the right nutrients

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:84%
and don't poison ourselves
with dangerous toxins.

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Most of the so-called
success that they

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.550 align:middle line:84%
would claim in
radiotherapy treatments,

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:34.540 align:middle line:84%
or chemotherapy treatments,
is based on shrinking a tumor.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, but most of these tumors
have cancerous stem cells.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So you shrink the other
cells in the tumor,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.990 align:middle line:84%
you physically reduce
the size of the tumor.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a symptomatic
difference.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't kill
the stem cells that

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.009 align:middle line:84%
are going to grow
back and spread

00:27:51.009 --> 00:27:52.300 align:middle line:90%
the cancer throughout the body.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.112 align:middle line:84%
You haven't addressed
the systemic problem.

00:27:54.112 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And what you've
even done is you've

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.640 align:middle line:84%
weakened the immune
system's ability

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:58.790 align:middle line:90%
to deal with other cancers.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Chemotherapy also
damages the brain.

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:10%
It causes chemo brain.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.530 align:middle line:10%
It's a common term.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:10%
Every oncologist knows
this is the case.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.310 align:middle line:10%
It damages the kidneys.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:90%
It damages the liver.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing
is, with chemotherapy,

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
you are creating systemic
damage to the body's ability

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.490 align:middle line:84%
to heal itself and
to remove toxins.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.920 align:middle line:84%
This is why cancer
treatments cause

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:84%
cancer, which feeds
into the profit

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.890 align:middle line:84%
cycle of the cancer industry,
which is a for-profit industry.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.604 align:middle line:84%
The cancer industry
is exploding.

00:28:34.604 --> 00:28:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing I would
say is follow the money, right?

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.940 align:middle line:10%
With any kind of
investigative journalism

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:41.050 align:middle line:10%
they would say the first
thing is to follow the money.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.430 align:middle line:10%
And so you have to
look at, what is

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.721 align:middle line:10%
the biggest industry right now?

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:10%
It's the cancer care industry.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:10%
So when the average
one in two men and one

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:10%
in three women, in their
lifetime, in the US

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.941 align:middle line:10%
now will have cancer,
it's an epidemic.

00:28:51.941 --> 00:28:53.440 align:middle line:10%
So you can watch
television tonight,

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.773 align:middle line:10%
and you can see a commercial
saying, go to the Caribbean

00:28:55.773 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:10%
and then go on a
nice cruise, or go

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.246 align:middle line:10%
to some resort with your child.

00:28:59.246 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:10%
And the next
following commercial

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.050 align:middle line:10%
will be go to this cancer
hospital for your treatment.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.880 align:middle line:10%
And 20 years ago, that would
be absurd, almost shocking

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:10%
or taboo, to talk about
cancer on television.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.990 align:middle line:10%
And now we're offering it as,
oh, well, if you get something,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:10%
you can go to this
place versus that place.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.535 align:middle line:10%
So there's something
that's gone askew.

00:29:14.535 --> 00:29:16.570 align:middle line:10%
And, now, since cancer
is so prevalent,

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:10%
it becomes a common aspect
where people think, well,

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:10%
when I get it, I can
just go to this place

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.410 align:middle line:10%
and check in for a while.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.150 align:middle line:10%
But, unfortunately, most
people don't check out, right?

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.934 align:middle line:10%
And so we have to look at, why
is this occurring so commonly,

00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:10%
and why, in the
rest of the world,

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.450 align:middle line:10%
it's occurring a
lot less frequently?

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Big pharma, the
Flexner Report, FDA raids,

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:90%
censorship of knowledge.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:84%
We're starting to get the
picture that not everything is

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.940 align:middle line:90%
as it appears today.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a
step back, and let's

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.050 align:middle line:90%
begin to ask the question--

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.165 align:middle line:90%
What is cancer.

00:29:45.165 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you ask
the common person

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.040 align:middle line:84%
on the street what
is cancer, they'd

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.210 align:middle line:90%
probably say it's a tumor.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:90%
But is it really?

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So I hit the road for
Amarillo, Texas, to talk to Dr.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.365 align:middle line:90%
Roby Mitchell.

00:29:54.365 --> 00:29:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Then I went to Atlanta
to interview Dr.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Véronique Desaulniers.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And then to New York City to
speak with Dr. Linda Isaacs.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
to Los Angeles

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.700 align:middle line:84%
to speak to G.
Edward Griffin again.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask them
all the same question--

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.360 align:middle line:90%
What is cancer?

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.260 align:middle line:10%
>> So, cancer, when we
look at it deductively--

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:10%
and, of course, the conventional
paradigm in the past was that

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:10%
cancer, or these cells
that have damaged DNA,

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:10%
and it's damaged in such a
way that it incensed them

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:10%
to multiply continuously.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So, normally, a cell
will be one cell,

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.355 align:middle line:84%
and it will multiply
into two, and then

00:30:30.355 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:90%
it will multiply into four.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.500 align:middle line:90%
So this is exponential growth.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, it
will shut off growth

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:90%
and it will just stay.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So your liver grows to a certain
size and it stays that size.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.284 align:middle line:84%
Your brain, your heart,
all these other cells,

00:30:44.284 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:84%
they grow to a certain size
and they stay that size.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So they have a
built-in regulator

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that keeps those
cells from growing

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:90%
more than a particular number.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.984 align:middle line:84%
In cancer cells, that
regulator is turned off,

00:30:56.984 --> 00:30:59.025 align:middle line:84%
and so they just keep
multiplying and multiplying

00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:00.580 align:middle line:90%
and multiplying and multiplying.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And because of their
physiologic make-up,

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that they absorb sugar, and
they absorb sugar better

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.340 align:middle line:84%
than your human cells, then they
suck up everything around them,

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and people with cancer
die of starvation.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> So Dr. V., what is cancer?

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:10%
>> Cancer are basically
rogue cells that are mutant,

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:24.260 align:middle line:10%
have DNA damage, and they're
escaped the guard, so to speak,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.080 align:middle line:10%
of the immune system.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.930 align:middle line:90%
And cancer cells are very smart.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Once they start developing,
they stop communicating

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.880 align:middle line:90%
with other cells around them.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
They create their own blood
flow so they can have lots

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.870 align:middle line:90%
of nutrition given to them.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.500 align:middle line:84%
They even secrete
specific enzymes

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:84%
to put the immune
system to sleep.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And they create a
protein called survivin.

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a funny name.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:90%
It's "survivin" not "surviving."

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:84%
But survivin, which
prevents the cancer cell

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.380 align:middle line:84%
from going through the natural
cycle of death or apoptosis,

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:90%
so cancer cells resist dying.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.710 align:middle line:90%
They continue to multiply.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:05.110 align:middle line:84%
They don't die like
normal cells, which

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.300 align:middle line:84%
is why traditional
treatments are

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.570 align:middle line:84%
so counterproductive and
counterintuitive because cancer

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:90%
cells resist dying.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they're trying to use
stronger poisons and more

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.310 align:middle line:84%
radiation to force
that cell to die,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.790 align:middle line:90%
but they're not getting it.

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me go back
to a basic question.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.380 align:middle line:90%
What is cancer?

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:28.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Cancer is a condition where
some cells in the body are no

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:10%
longer responding to the signals
that tell them when to quit.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:37.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, most cells that
have a purpose for developing,

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.300 align:middle line:84%
they develop to a certain
point and then they stop.

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.150 align:middle line:90%
Cancer cells keep reproducing.

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So they keep growing, and they
can spread to other places.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
called a metastasis.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So cancer cells have escaped the
normal controls for regulation

00:32:55.930 --> 00:33:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and how big a bunch of
cells is supposed to become.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The present orthodox view
is that cancer is a lump

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:05.740 align:middle line:90%
or a bump.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:07.480 align:middle line:90%
That's the cancer.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.460 align:middle line:10%
That's the assumption.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, if that is true,
then to get rid of cancer,

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.610 align:middle line:10%
all you would have to do is get
rid of the lump or the bump.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:17.110 align:middle line:90%
And, hence, we have surgery.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that gets rid of
the lump or the bump.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Or we have chemotherapy, which
poisons the lump or the bump,

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.910 align:middle line:90%
if we got rid of it.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Or we have radiation, which
burns it and got rid of it.

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And you undergo these
three therapies.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And to get rid of the lump or
the bump, the doctor will say,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:90%
it looks like we got it all.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.750 align:middle line:90%
That famous line, we got it all.

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:90%
But did they?

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.360 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Statistics show that in
most cases, it comes back.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get it all
because that was never

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:90%
the cancer in the first place.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're a farmer and you see
all these little black spots

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:84%
on your corn leaves,
and you think,

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:90%
well, those are black spots.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.571 align:middle line:90%
That's the disease.

00:33:57.571 --> 00:34:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And you get the scissors out
and you cut all the black spots

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.217 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:34:01.217 --> 00:34:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, you think, we
got it all, right?

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.290 align:middle line:84%
No, you didn't because
that wasn't the disease.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:84%
What caused those black
spots is still present.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a great analogy
by G. Edward Griffin.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.340 align:middle line:90%
What caused the black spots?

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to cancer.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.199 align:middle line:84%
We need to figure out what
caused the lump or the bump.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at the
cause and not the symptom.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get the opinion
of Dr. Rashid Buttar,

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.760 align:middle line:84%
so I caught a plane
to North Carolina.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Cancer is not the problem.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is a symptom.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.227 align:middle line:10%
If you want to look at
it from a car analogy--

00:34:30.227 --> 00:34:32.560 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why everybody
seems to understand analogies

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.370 align:middle line:10%
when we use cars--

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.040 align:middle line:10%
cancer is a flashing
light on the dashboard.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.305 align:middle line:10%
And the reason chemo and
radiation and surgery

00:34:38.305 --> 00:34:40.429 align:middle line:10%
don't work is because
everybody is taking a hammer,

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:43.804 align:middle line:10%
they're taking a hammer
to that flashing light

00:34:43.804 --> 00:34:44.604 align:middle line:10%
on the dashboard--

00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:45.892 align:middle line:10%
>> The check engine light.

00:34:45.892 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:10%
The check engine light.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:47.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:48.139 align:middle line:10%
The check engine light.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:49.060 align:middle line:10%
The flashing that's
saying that there's

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:10%
a problem with the engine.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:10%
So everybody is
saying, I can fix that,

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.080 align:middle line:10%
and they're hitting
that light, but that's

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.460 align:middle line:10%
not going to fix the engine.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So my question to
patients is very simple.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:84%
If you took your
car to a mechanic,

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.500 align:middle line:84%
and there was a flashing check
engine light on your car,

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanic says,
yeah, I can fix that,

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:12.090 align:middle line:84%
and takes the fuse out and says,
OK, now your problem is solved.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Or, I've got a
knocking in my engine.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, here,
turn up the radio.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.354 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear it now?

00:35:16.354 --> 00:35:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can kind
of still hear it.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Here, put some earmuffs on.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:19.875 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't hear it.

00:35:19.875 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, perfect.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.470 align:middle line:84%
You haven't done
anything to the engine.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:25.679 align:middle line:90%
>> I would fire the mechanic.

00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:26.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly!

00:35:26.478 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's the question
that, when you ask a person,

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:30.640 align:middle line:84%
the logical answer is,
yeah, I'd fire the mechanic.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So then why aren't they
firing the doctors,

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.013 align:middle line:84%
because that's exactly
what the doctors are doing?

00:35:34.013 --> 00:35:34.990 align:middle line:90%
They've got a problem.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.180 align:middle line:84%
They're covering it up with a
drug to cover up the symptoms

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.400 align:middle line:84%
so a person doesn't feel
or experience the negative,

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.890 align:middle line:84%
which is the body's own
mechanism of information

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:44.317 align:middle line:84%
saying, hey, caution,
there's a problem.

00:35:44.317 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's what cancer is.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Cancer is really the symptom.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:50.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Cancer is the
symptom of a sick body.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:55.110 align:middle line:10%
And you cannot cut a tumor off
or shrink a tumor or poison

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:58.252 align:middle line:10%
a tumor and expect to
stay well and stay healthy

00:35:58.252 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:10%
because you're not
addressing the real problem,

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.280 align:middle line:10%
you're only addressing
the symptom.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's like cutting off your
nose to get rid of a cold.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't solve the
real, underlying problem.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Every symptom is the
body doing the right thing

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:13.160 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.280 align:middle line:84%
If, right now, if I
put handcuffs on you

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and locked you up and
came at you with a knife,

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.327 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
your blood pressure?

00:36:19.327 --> 00:36:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Your blood pressure rises.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.243 align:middle line:84%
What happens to your
cortisol during stress?

00:36:22.243 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Your cortisol rises.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.490 align:middle line:90%
What happens to your gut?

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:26.929 align:middle line:84%
You start taking away all the
nutrition out of your body.

00:36:26.929 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
You can't even absorb
nutrition when you're

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.414 align:middle line:90%
in a fight or flight syndrome.

00:36:30.414 --> 00:36:32.080 align:middle line:10%
So all of a sudden,
you're nutritionally

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:10%
deficient, your
immune system is shot,

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.190 align:middle line:10%
your blood pressure is rising.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Now your cholesterol
is being affected.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that a symptom?

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:44.609 align:middle line:84%
Is that your genetics,
or is your body adapting?

00:36:44.609 --> 00:36:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Is that symptom in
your body adapting

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.500 align:middle line:90%
to the stress it's put under?

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.790 align:middle line:90%
It's adapting.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So cancer is a symptom of
something that's gone wrong

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:52.390 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's just a symptom.

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.540 align:middle line:90%
The tumor is not the problem.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But so often now,
in modern oncology,

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.520 align:middle line:84%
we smash the check
engine light of our body.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.020 align:middle line:90%
We cut out the tumor.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:84%
But there's an underlying
problem that's still going on.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:84%
But did you catch
what Dr. Majors said?

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Every symptom is the body
doing the right thing

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.337 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:37:11.337 --> 00:37:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to speak at
the Cancer Control Society

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.386 align:middle line:84%
Convention in Los
Angeles in August.

00:37:15.386 --> 00:37:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And while I was there,
I was fortunate enough

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.390 align:middle line:90%
to speak with Dr. Brad Weeks.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:22.710 align:middle line:84%
He said something almost
identical to Dr. Majors.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:27.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Samuel Hahnemann, who was a
medical doctor who actually was

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.690 align:middle line:10%
so frustrated with the
standard of care in his day,

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:31.780 align:middle line:10%
he gave up his medical practice.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.470 align:middle line:84%
He gave up his MD,
and he went into

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and formed a whole field of
medicine called homeopathy,

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:90%
which is a whole nother topic.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:46.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very fruitful
study about healing.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of his favorite
quotes is that "the symptom

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.970 align:middle line:90%
is a healing gesture."

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:54.190 align:middle line:90%
The body is no dummy.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:59.500 align:middle line:84%
If the body's doing something,
it's probably a wise thing.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It's maybe not a
permanent solution,

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:02.770 align:middle line:90%
it's maybe a stopgap solution.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:04.360 align:middle line:90%
But like a fever.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, if the child
has a fever, guess what?

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.950 align:middle line:84%
The human being can live at
a high temperature or a low

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:84%
temperature, but
certain bacteria can't.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So the fever is a naturally
tremendously beneficial symptom

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.530 align:middle line:84%
which can help the
child get healthy,

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.890 align:middle line:84%
which is why after a fever, our
language says, I feel better.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Nobody says, I had a
fever and I'm feeling

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:90%
like I felt before the fever.

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.990 align:middle line:84%
It's been a cleansing
and detoxifying process.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, too much of a
symptom can be, if not lethal,

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:37.030 align:middle line:90%
certainly terrible.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Helen Keller
is a classic example

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.120 align:middle line:90%
of too much of a fever.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not advocating
for excessive symptoms.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying, if
the symptom happens,

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.390 align:middle line:90%
the body should pay attention.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And, often, it's
the, if you will,

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.657 align:middle line:84%
it's the auto pilot
telling us dummies,

00:38:53.657 --> 00:38:55.240 align:middle line:84%
hey, you're not doing
something right.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:00.880 align:middle line:10%
So cancer can be seen as a
symptom, as a healing gesture.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.285 align:middle line:10%
What I've lectured
on in the past

00:39:02.285 --> 00:39:04.410 align:middle line:10%
is that, where I grew up
in northern New Hampshire,

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.860 align:middle line:10%
there was a town dump.

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we all knew we
could take our trash over

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.160 align:middle line:90%
to farmer Jones's back 40.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And we put stuff there.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And we used to go there as kids
and watch the bears and stuff.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.370 align:middle line:84%
But, the fact of the matter
is, if God reached down

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.490 align:middle line:84%
with a big excavator and
took all the trash out

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:25.300 align:middle line:84%
of farmer Jones's backyard and
we couldn't use it anymore,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.821 align:middle line:84%
we'd go to farmer Smith and
we'd pay him 40 bucks a year

00:39:27.821 --> 00:39:28.820 align:middle line:90%
to dump our trash there.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And because we could take
our trash to these back 40s,

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:84%
we could keep our front
yards pretty clean.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
cancer in a breast,

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that's metaphorical,
it's analogous to a cancer

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.140 align:middle line:90%
being like a dump.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
The body's saying
something's wrong here,

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.130 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to put everything
in Farmer Jones's back 40,

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.120 align:middle line:84%
in the left breast,
and there's a cancer.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:90%
It's never the problem.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It's always a symptom of
other diseases or imbalances.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And, so, if you just lop
off the breast and say,

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Jones, you're
cancer-free, you're

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.450 align:middle line:84%
ignoring the fact that unless
you change your behavior,

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:10.060 align:middle line:84%
the cancer will
manifest somewhere else.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So unless you
change your behavior,

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.650 align:middle line:84%
the cancer is going to come back
and manifest somewhere else.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.320 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the opposite
of what we typically hear.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:84%
We hear, OK, you
have this disease,

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.980 align:middle line:84%
here's this drug and
this drug and this drug.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.376 align:middle line:90%
But let me ask you a question.

00:40:23.376 --> 00:40:25.000 align:middle line:84%
When you take all
these drugs together,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:84%
have they ever been
tested for safety?

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:28.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's listen to KC Craichy.

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Jeffrey Bland gave
a talk this weekend,

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and he's the founder
of Functional Medicine.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:35.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the guy's brilliant.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.870 align:middle line:10%
And he was saying that he has
always been blasted about,

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.720 align:middle line:10%
oh, your stuff's
not double-blind,

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.706 align:middle line:10%
placebo-controlled, and I only
practice scientific medicine.

00:40:44.706 --> 00:40:46.330 align:middle line:10%
And he finally says
he got to the point

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:48.540 align:middle line:10%
where he says to the doctor,
let me ask you this question,

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.039 align:middle line:10%
and you'll be honest
with me, right?

00:40:50.039 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:84%
We'll agree that
I'm a little bit

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.204 align:middle line:84%
on the outskirts of
what you're talking

00:40:53.204 --> 00:40:54.862 align:middle line:90%
about as scientific medicine.

00:40:54.862 --> 00:40:56.070 align:middle line:90%
But let me ask this question.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever
prescribed a patient

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.500 align:middle line:84%
a drug who was already
on four other drugs?

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, of course.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And could you
point me to a study

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:11.164 align:middle line:84%
that showed a patient
population on those five drugs?

00:41:11.164 --> 00:41:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had the study
for this drug and this--

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.204 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not what I said.

00:41:14.204 --> 00:41:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Could you show me a
patient population

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:20.410 align:middle line:84%
that has been studied
on those five drugs?

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
is, of course not.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was told by a
doctor, Dr. Scott Hannen,

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.060 align:middle line:84%
about a study he's sending
me here recently that there's

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.860 align:middle line:84%
a study out that
says that if you are

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.100 align:middle line:84%
on five or more
medications, it is

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.873 align:middle line:84%
impossible to predict the
clinical response of the five

00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:41.673 align:middle line:90%
drugs.

00:41:41.673 --> 00:41:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.436 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so that's why
it's all a guessing game.

00:41:44.436 --> 00:41:47.090 align:middle line:10%
They would give a drug for
this and a drug for that,

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.430 align:middle line:10%
and then you end up giving
drugs for the symptoms caused

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:50.230 align:middle line:10%
by drugs.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.070 align:middle line:84%
It's really, it's
an awful spiral.

00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:54.529 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a place
for some drugs some time,

00:41:54.529 --> 00:41:56.320 align:middle line:84%
but I generally think
of them as a band-aid

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.069 align:middle line:84%
to get people over a hump
before they can figure out

00:41:59.069 --> 00:42:01.360 align:middle line:84%
how to get their body responding
like it's supposed to.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.485 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think the
difficulty in the problem with

00:42:03.485 --> 00:42:05.920 align:middle line:10%
the conventional care that's
been given is that disease

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.770 align:middle line:10%
management model, and the rest
of the world has a concept

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:10.780 align:middle line:10%
of a disease resolution model.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:90%
So we can manage the disease.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I can always put
a band-aid on it.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.144 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes we need band-aids.

00:42:15.144 --> 00:42:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But by the time we
see patients, they're

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:17.790 align:middle line:90%
a lot more like mummies.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:19.623 align:middle line:84%
They were wrapped up
with so many band-aids.

00:42:19.623 --> 00:42:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So we treat the
symptoms very well.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And in Western medicine,
acute care is phenomenal.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.542 align:middle line:90%
America is number one at trauma.

00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you get a gunshot wound,
a car accident, or you break

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.875 align:middle line:84%
a bone, I'm going to go
to the local hospital

00:42:29.875 --> 00:42:31.060 align:middle line:90%
here, absolutely.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.905 align:middle line:10%
But outside that emergency
room, which most people live,

00:42:34.905 --> 00:42:37.030 align:middle line:10%
we have this concept of,
again, disease management.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:90%
So we treat the symptoms.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.929 align:middle line:84%
We treat the symptoms,
and never going at what's

00:42:39.929 --> 00:42:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the underlying cause of
the symptom, the imbalance,

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:90%
or the dysfunction.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.958 align:middle line:84%
I gave a lecture the
other day at a conference,

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and then I got a little
feedback that was a slightly

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.170 align:middle line:90%
negative from the audience.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.378 align:middle line:90%
It was a bunch of physicians.

00:42:51.378 --> 00:42:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
physicians like us physicians,

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.060 align:middle line:90%
we're very much like James Bond.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:56.860 align:middle line:90%
And they go why?

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.235 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
we're good looking,

00:42:58.235 --> 00:43:00.880 align:middle line:84%
it's that we all have
a license to kill.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.250 align:middle line:10%
We have a prescription that
we can give someone they

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.380 align:middle line:10%
either can save their life
and also can kill them.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And we forget that
sometimes, that we

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.270 align:middle line:84%
give things that have
actually detrimental effect.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>> They seem to think that
taking a drug and covering up

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:90%
a symptom is a better option.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.919 align:middle line:84%
You've got a pile of
horse manure here.

00:43:15.919 --> 00:43:16.960 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, the logical thing would be
take the manure out and get rid

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.112 align:middle line:10%
of it, but instead
they put a carpet down.

00:43:22.112 --> 00:43:24.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's still kind of
lumpy, then they flatten it.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can still smell it, and
they spray some air freshener

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:26.560 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.450 align:middle line:84%
This is like one drug over
another drug over another drug

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.790 align:middle line:84%
trying to deal with the symptom
side effects of the first drug

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and second drug or third drug.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And, finally, the person
just deteriorates.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:37.480 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you say, when you
put a carpet over that manure,

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.680 align:middle line:84%
you spray air freshener,
you put perfume out there,

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.540 align:middle line:84%
you burn a match,
whatever the case

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.260 align:middle line:90%
is, the problem is still there.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.930 align:middle line:90%
You've only covered it up.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>> One of KC Craichy's
quotes really struck me.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:84%
He said it's impossible to
predict the outcome of taking

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.920 align:middle line:90%
five drugs together.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.344 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you know that
are taking at least five drugs

00:43:58.344 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:90%
and maybe more?

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Buttar's
analogy of covering up

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.880 align:middle line:90%
the manure with a carpet.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.350 align:middle line:90%
That really struck home as well.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So I headed back home
to the Lone Star State

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.010 align:middle line:84%
to see what Dr. Irvin
Sahni has to say

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:12.130 align:middle line:84%
about the current medical
system and the pervasiveness

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:13.700 align:middle line:90%
of prescription drugs.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The system is designed
to create chronic disease.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.160 align:middle line:10%
There's no money
in being healthy.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.770 align:middle line:10%
There's no money in being dead.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.060 align:middle line:10%
All the money is in
being chronically ill.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.580 align:middle line:10%
And so the way the renumeration
works for physicians,

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:35.950 align:middle line:10%
even with Medicare, is that
it encourages more drugs

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.120 align:middle line:10%
to be written.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So by design I feel like
the system is flawed.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And who do you think is
paying the Congress people

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:46.390 align:middle line:84%
money for their next
election campaign?

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Some small-town
doctor who's trying

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:50.469 align:middle line:84%
to educate people on how to
lose weight or Pfizer or Merck?

00:44:50.469 --> 00:44:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not picking on
any specific company here,

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:53.593 align:middle line:90%
but it's just simply true.

00:44:53.593 --> 00:44:55.200 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
money comes from.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's how these jobs are
created and billions of dollars

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.000 align:middle line:84%
are paid out to
different individuals.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
system is flawed.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.600 align:middle line:90%
That's my opinion.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.322 align:middle line:84%
That's one aspect of
it that's very easy

00:45:06.322 --> 00:45:07.780 align:middle line:84%
to sink your teeth
into, and no one

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.654 align:middle line:84%
can tell me that I'm
wrong because it's true.

00:45:09.654 --> 00:45:10.490 align:middle line:90%
It's just a fact.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this isn't something
that's up for discussion.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.730 align:middle line:84%
This is just pure
and simply a fact.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Very telling
information from Dr. Sahni.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.152 align:middle line:84%
He says that the
system is flawed.

00:45:20.152 --> 00:45:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But what about the main
treatments for cancer today--

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.720 align:middle line:84%
the chemo, the
radiation, and surgery?

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.887 align:middle line:84%
Is our cancer
system also flawed?

00:45:26.887 --> 00:45:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear what several
prominent physicians

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.900 align:middle line:90%
have to say about this matter.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.560 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
cancer, typically,

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.260 align:middle line:84%
conventional medicine will
treat with either chemotherapy

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.800 align:middle line:84%
or radiation or surgery,
or a combination thereof.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your opinion on the
efficacy of the conventional

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:42.940 align:middle line:90%
treatments?

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.810 align:middle line:10%
>> So, each situation
is different,

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:47.700 align:middle line:10%
and so we have to approach
each situation as different.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.620 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, in a lot
of conventional medicine--

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.530 align:middle line:10%
I was just down at MD Anderson--

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:57.100 align:middle line:10%
people are treated more
like a feedlot situation

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.160 align:middle line:10%
where, if you have
this, colon cancer,

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.660 align:middle line:10%
this is the protocol
that we use.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.034 align:middle line:84%
If you've got
breast cancer, this

00:46:03.034 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:90%
is the protocol that we use.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And, obviously, that has failed.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.260 align:middle line:10%
Our problem with
conventional therapy

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.980 align:middle line:10%
is when cancer has moved
from one place to another.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.370 align:middle line:84%
When there is a metastasis from
the prostate into the bone,

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:20.450 align:middle line:84%
or from the breast into the
brain, or from the colon

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:23.690 align:middle line:84%
into the lymph nodes,
then conventional therapy

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.403 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work so well.

00:46:25.403 --> 00:46:26.250 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.870 align:middle line:84%
So it does depend on what
type of cancer there is.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:33.110 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of
rarer types of cancers,

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:37.340 align:middle line:84%
like the cancer that
Lance Armstrong had,

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.700 align:middle line:84%
that was amenable to the
conventional approach.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And he goes on to be able
to cheat and win some races.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That was testicular cancer.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:47.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:47.603 --> 00:46:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Testicular cancer.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>> To cheat and win some races.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are some
blood-borne cancers also that

00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:01.100 align:middle line:84%
respond to the
conventional therapy.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:05.070 align:middle line:10%
But, for the most part, the
bread-and-butter cancers--

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:07.440 align:middle line:10%
so when we're looking
at ovarian cancer,

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.100 align:middle line:10%
pancreatic cancer, prostate
cancer, breast cancer,

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:10%
colon cancer, uterine cancer--

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.530 align:middle line:10%


00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.080 align:middle line:10%
once the barn door gets
open with any of those,

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.280 align:middle line:10%
then the conventional
therapeutic model doesn't work.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:25.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Then went into the internal
medicine residency in San

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:29.360 align:middle line:10%
Francisco where I got my
internal medicine degree.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.870 align:middle line:10%
And, then, from there, I went
to an oncology fellowship, Ty,

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:35.485 align:middle line:10%
which was another two years.

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:38.480 align:middle line:10%
I kind of overtrained, actually.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.730 align:middle line:10%
I finished that up
in '73 and then went

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:44.630 align:middle line:10%
into practice in San
Francisco as an oncologist

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:47.122 align:middle line:10%
with a group of oncologists.

00:47:47.122 --> 00:47:48.830 align:middle line:10%
After a couple of
years in San Francisco,

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.621 align:middle line:10%
I decided I wanted to
be in a smaller town,

00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:51.456 align:middle line:10%
so I moved to Reno.

00:47:51.456 --> 00:47:52.580 align:middle line:10%
I've been there ever since.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.380 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.550 align:middle line:10%
>> 40 years, now.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.430 align:middle line:84%
The first 20 years
of my practice

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.070 align:middle line:84%
there, I was doing
everything just

00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:59.840 align:middle line:90%
cookbook style, Betty Crocker.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Conventional.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Conventional,
doing their protocols,

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.990 align:middle line:10%
just like the book said.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:08.570 align:middle line:10%
Then I began to notice that
my long-term survivor list was

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:11.690 align:middle line:10%
pretty short, and I began
reading the literature

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:12.860 align:middle line:10%
that everyone was.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:17.060 align:middle line:10%
That after five years of
chemo, in their own literature,

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.640 align:middle line:10%
they recorded only
2.1% survival rate.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.210 align:middle line:10%
So any adult undergoing
chemo with stage 4 disease,

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.940 align:middle line:10%
two out of 100 of them would
be alive at five years.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.270 align:middle line:10%
Not a-- you wouldn't
hire a baseball player

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:31.690 align:middle line:10%
with a 2% batting average.

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:33.080 align:middle line:10%
Not a real good--

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.920 align:middle line:10%
So I finally realized,
I couldn't participate

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.790 align:middle line:10%
in this act for very
long, so I decided

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:44.180 align:middle line:10%
to get my homeopathic degree.

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:10%
>> All of the drugs that you
see, if you pick up the label,

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.515 align:middle line:10%
all of the chemo drug
says "causes cancer."

00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:54.210 align:middle line:10%


00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:55.010 align:middle line:10%
Think about it.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:48:59.450 align:middle line:10%
>> We use a drug to treat
cancer that causes cancer,

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.940 align:middle line:10%
a known carcinogen?

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:04.160 align:middle line:10%
How crazy is that?

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:10%
But that's what we do every
day in every institution

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.440 align:middle line:10%
across America.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.460 align:middle line:10%
We use radiation.

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.290 align:middle line:10%
What do X-rays cause?

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:14.100 align:middle line:10%
Hello, cancer.

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're using that,
supposedly, to treat it?

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:24.020 align:middle line:10%
So a stage 4 cancer in America's
survival rate is about 2%.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:28.340 align:middle line:90%
You know, that is horrific.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.470 align:middle line:90%
It can't get any worse than 2%.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So 2% success rate
for stage 4 cancers

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.100 align:middle line:90%
is beyond comprehension.

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:43.820 align:middle line:10%
The patients would live
much longer and healthier

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.330 align:middle line:10%
if they did nothing, if
they didn't take the drugs,

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:51.210 align:middle line:10%
because the drugs are
hastening their death.

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:52.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:54.480 align:middle line:10%
And I've read studies.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:55.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Don't get me started.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.329 align:middle line:10%
>> I think you're
already started.

00:49:57.329 --> 00:49:59.370 align:middle line:10%
I think you're already
going, which I am enjoying

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.020 align:middle line:10%
because it's good information.

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.870 align:middle line:10%
I've read studies of people
saying the same thing, doctors

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:05.370 align:middle line:10%
and scientists
saying that you would

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:09.130 align:middle line:10%
live longer by doing nothing
than by doing the treatment.

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.220 align:middle line:10%
And, I can't remember
the medical doctor

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.260 align:middle line:10%
that I was just talking
to recently said

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:10%
that in all his years of
treating cancer patients,

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.820 align:middle line:10%
that he's never actually seen
one that died from the cancer,

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.500 align:middle line:10%
that they always died
from the treatment.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.330 align:middle line:10%
You know, primary tumors
almost never kill anyone,

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:28.500 align:middle line:10%
unless they're in the brain.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.390 align:middle line:10%
A primary tumor
can kill you there.

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:35.700 align:middle line:10%
But, if you give it long
enough, the metastases

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.950 align:middle line:10%
can eventually get you.

00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:42.750 align:middle line:84%
But almost no one in America
today dies of their cancer.

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:46.110 align:middle line:84%
They die of the side
effects of the chemo.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.610 align:middle line:10%
I shouldn't call
those side effects.

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:50.640 align:middle line:90%
The direct effects of chemo.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.400 align:middle line:84%
We call them side effects
because they're unwanted,

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.210 align:middle line:84%
but they are direct
effects of the chemo agent.

00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:01.710 align:middle line:10%
>> It doesn't make sense
to poison and to radiate

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:05.920 align:middle line:10%
and to cut a body that's
already sick in the first place.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.160 align:middle line:84%
People don't get sick
because they have cancer.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.300 align:middle line:84%
They're already sick and
then they develop cancer.

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you start trying to poison
and put these horrific things

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.690 align:middle line:84%
into a person's
body that's already

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:20.640 align:middle line:84%
weak and sick in
the first place,

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.720 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
get very good results.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And statistics show us that.

00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.020 align:middle line:84%
The study done in
Australia, at the University

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:32.920 align:middle line:84%
of Sydney, Australia, where they
looked at 22 different cancers

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.810 align:middle line:84%
over a five-year period,
and they found only a 2.2%,

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:39.540 align:middle line:84%
on average, success
rate with chemotherapy.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, those
aren't very good odds.

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:46.470 align:middle line:84%
If you cut out an
organ, if it's diseased,

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.870 align:middle line:84%
what are you
telling that patient

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:51.300 align:middle line:84%
to prevent that from
happening again?

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the traditional
methods of treatment

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:55.540 align:middle line:90%
is just not working.

00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So I headed to Memphis to
talk to my friend, Chris Wark,

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.520 align:middle line:90%
a cancer survivor.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What's amazing is so
many cancer patients,

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:03.811 align:middle line:84%
when they're diagnosed
and they're told they need

00:52:03.811 --> 00:52:06.200 align:middle line:84%
chemotherapy, almost all of
them don't want to do it.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.139 align:middle line:10%
Instinctively, they
don't want to do it.

00:52:08.139 --> 00:52:09.430 align:middle line:10%
They don't want to be poisoned.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:10.560 align:middle line:10%
They don't want to suffer.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.400 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to get sicker.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But everyone tells
them they have to,

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and so they reluctantly
agree to do it.

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And for most of them,
it doesn't end well.

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.670 align:middle line:84%
They get a treatment, or
a series of treatments,

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and there will be a very
short window of time

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:29.830 align:middle line:84%
where the doctors
can't find any tumors.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll say, you're in
remission, you're cancer-free.

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Yay!

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:35.910 align:middle line:84%
We see celebrity
headlines all the time--

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.220 align:middle line:84%
"I'm cancer-free now," after
having a tumor cut off.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.850 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is,
you're not cancer-free.

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:43.230 align:middle line:84%
You still have cancer
cells in your body.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:44.355 align:middle line:90%
You still have a sick body.

00:52:44.355 --> 00:52:46.230 align:middle line:84%
You still have a
depleted immune system.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter of
time before new tumors form.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's really sad to
watch cancer patients go

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.184 align:middle line:84%
through this process of,
oh, I'm in remission,

00:52:56.184 --> 00:52:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and they think
everything's great,

00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and they can go back
to a normal life.

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And a few months later,
they have another scan,

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and there's a new
spot or several.

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.520 align:middle line:10%
Or it's migrated from what
started as a tiny lump

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.120 align:middle line:10%
in one breast, is
now in their brain,

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.790 align:middle line:10%
in their liver, spots on
their bones, in their lungs.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:14.890 align:middle line:10%
And we know that's
from the chemotherapy.

00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:17.370 align:middle line:84%
It's causing it to spread,
it's making it more aggressive,

00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's causing secondary
cancers in the body.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Radiation as well.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that was
my next question is,

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:24.600 align:middle line:84%
do you think that it's
related to the chemotherapy?

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.870 align:middle line:84%
We know it is because
of the industry studies.

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.960 align:middle line:84%
The studies that have come
from the cancer industry

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:84%
tell us that chemotherapy
is carcinogenic,

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:36.510 align:middle line:90%
it causes secondary cancers.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:38.010 align:middle line:84%
There are many
chemotherapy drugs

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that are known carcinogens
and listed by the US National

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Toxicology Board as carcinogens.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.510 align:middle line:90%
They cause cancer.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.530 align:middle line:10%
>> It's estimated by 2020 that
50% of all cancer in America

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:55.090 align:middle line:10%
will be medical X-ray-induced
or drug-induced.

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So we will be responsible, in
a very few short years, for 50%

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:01.110 align:middle line:90%
of all cancer in America.

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That's staggering.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>> That's staggering, and the
medical society is doing this

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.240 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.790 align:middle line:90%
We are doing it to the people.

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>> That's-- that's mind
blowing, that by 2020 we will be

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.510 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
50% of the cancers.

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:19.870 align:middle line:90%
>> It's staggering.

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:22.251 align:middle line:10%
And, especially, in
light of the fact

00:54:22.251 --> 00:54:25.660 align:middle line:10%
that the recent statistics
from the WHO and the ACS

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.000 align:middle line:10%
are indicating that one in
two men, one in three women

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.380 align:middle line:10%
alive today will face cancer.

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.005 align:middle line:10%
And they're saying
that half of that is

00:54:31.005 --> 00:54:32.330 align:middle line:10%
caused by the medical system.

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm blown away, and I
don't get blown away easily.

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:40.210 align:middle line:84%
50% of cancers are actually
caused by the treatments?

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And, in light of
this information,

00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:44.122 align:middle line:84%
do you think that
oncologists themselves

00:54:44.122 --> 00:54:45.580 align:middle line:84%
would take these
treatments if they

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.080 align:middle line:90%
were diagnosed with cancer?

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:10%
>> 86% of oncologists polled,
or so, said they wouldn't give

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.590 align:middle line:10%
themselves what they
give their patients.

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:54.340 align:middle line:10%
>> They would not take
chemo or radiation?

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:55.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow!

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.160 align:middle line:10%
86%.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.280 align:middle line:10%
>> 86%.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.780 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a study that came
out, about 90% of physicians,

00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:02.890 align:middle line:10%
particularly in oncology, would
not prescribe the drug that

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:07.100 align:middle line:10%
they give to their patients
to their wife or their child.

00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:07.900 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:08.983 align:middle line:10%
So what does that tell us?

00:55:08.983 --> 00:55:10.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's just my job.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.580 align:middle line:10%
So there's a disconnect between
the patient and the physician

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.380 align:middle line:10%
now.

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Charles Majors is a prime
example of a physician that was

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:20.950 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with cancer himself--
he had multiple myeloma that

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.210 align:middle line:90%
spread to his brain--

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and he did not chose the
big three treatments.

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Let's listen to
what he has to say.

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The most important thing
when I'm working with a cancer

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.330 align:middle line:84%
patient, the first thing I
want them to understand is,

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.100 align:middle line:84%
you've got to understand
what cancer is.

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:37.750 align:middle line:10%
You're walking in to talk to
me or have a visit with me,

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:39.670 align:middle line:10%
you have no idea what
cancer is, but you're

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:44.380 align:middle line:10%
about to do chemo,
radiation, and/or surgery,

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:46.506 align:middle line:10%
but you don't even know
what you're dealing with.

00:55:46.506 --> 00:55:49.139 align:middle line:10%
And, so, the first
thing I had to do

00:55:49.139 --> 00:55:50.680 align:middle line:10%
was, I had to find
out and figure out

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.120 align:middle line:10%
exactly what cancer was.

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if I wanted
to reverse this,

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:55.830 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what it was.

00:55:55.830 --> 00:56:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And, so, our body is made of
50, 60, 70 trillion cells.

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Those cells grow and
die every single day.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.050 align:middle line:90%
They grow and die.

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Every one of our cells
has a cell death.

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:09.490 align:middle line:90%
They have a life.

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:10.300 align:middle line:90%
They die.

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.910 align:middle line:84%
They grow, they die, they grow,
they die, they grow, they die.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Right now, as
you're sitting here,

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:17.027 align:middle line:84%
you will lose over a
million cells in a second.

00:56:17.027 --> 00:56:18.360 align:middle line:90%
And what happens a second later?

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.190 align:middle line:90%
They re-grow.

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:21.540 align:middle line:84%
There is an intelligence
inside of you

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.030 align:middle line:84%
that is more incredible
than anything else.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Your body heals, it
regulates, it kills.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:30.440 align:middle line:10%
Those cells die, and
those cells re-grow again.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:33.400 align:middle line:10%
So cancer is when those
cells no longer die.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.480 align:middle line:90%
It's called apoptosis.

00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Those cells no
longer die, and they

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.670 align:middle line:84%
begin to replicate
themselves, and they grow.

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I needed to figure
is why would those cancer

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:44.860 align:middle line:90%
cells show up?

00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.030 align:middle line:90%
Why are they there?

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And why haven't they gone away?

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.480 align:middle line:90%
We all get cancer every day.

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.286 align:middle line:84%
Some of the research shows
between 5,000, 10,000,

00:56:52.286 --> 00:56:54.160 align:middle line:84%
20,000 cancer cells are
showing up every day.

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.243 align:middle line:84%
We have an immune system
that takes control of it.

00:56:56.243 --> 00:56:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> The cancer is not some
alien thing that was dumped

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.430 align:middle line:84%
in your body from a
space ship or something.

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:01.390 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:03.490 align:middle line:10%
And if your body has
kind of gone a bit wrong,

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.700 align:middle line:10%
and if you fix things, your
body will restore its health.

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.910 align:middle line:10%
It's not a runaway train
that can't be stopped.

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, it's a runaway,
but you can put the breaks on

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and then reverse it.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And, there, you see
that a lot, of course.

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:18.855 align:middle line:84%
The number of
natural cures not are

00:57:18.855 --> 00:57:21.310 align:middle line:84%
so vast, you'd have to
be blind or dumb not

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:24.040 align:middle line:84%
to see what's going
on and not to realize

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.484 align:middle line:84%
that orthodox medicine isn't
hitting the bar at all.

00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:28.150 align:middle line:10%
>> I couldn't stay
on the same path, Ty.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:29.470 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't working.

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:31.840 align:middle line:10%
I found I was just using
more and more drugs

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.902 align:middle line:10%
to treat the symptoms
from the other drugs.

00:57:33.902 --> 00:57:36.110 align:middle line:10%
And, more importantly, people
weren't getting better.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:37.390 align:middle line:10%
And it just wasn't
working for me.

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:39.181 align:middle line:10%
And either I was going
to give up medicine,

00:57:39.181 --> 00:57:41.230 align:middle line:10%
or I had to find a
different model to use.

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, looking at
things from a biochemical model

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and a natural model, to try
and supply the body with what

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.322 align:middle line:84%
it needs so it can
take care of itself,

00:57:49.322 --> 00:57:50.530 align:middle line:90%
is really a better way to go.

00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> How it makes me
feel is very upset.

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:55.480 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
I'm angry is because I

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.790 align:middle line:10%
feel that at least
it's negligence that's

00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:59.950 align:middle line:10%
what's happening in the
conventional medical care,

00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:03.650 align:middle line:10%
particularly with oncological
patients and cancer treatments.

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And, if you go
further, it almost

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:09.040 align:middle line:84%
could be thought of as criminal
because we are letting people

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:13.000 align:middle line:84%
die unnecessarily, we're giving
people a lower quality of lives

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and lower outcomes, but we're
pushing profits every day.

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:19.300 align:middle line:84%
This is injustice, and I
can't be silent anymore.

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.256 align:middle line:10%
Everybody has the right, right?

00:58:21.256 --> 00:58:23.630 align:middle line:10%
It's even like the Declaration
of Independence, you know.

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:28.070 align:middle line:10%
You have the right for
these things, the freedoms,

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:30.190 align:middle line:10%
to have pursuit of
happiness, and we

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.840 align:middle line:10%
have to really pursue that.

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.660 align:middle line:10%
And you can't pursue
happiness without health.

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.761 align:middle line:84%
And what makes more people
happy is just feeling healthy.

00:58:37.761 --> 00:58:39.010 align:middle line:10%
You can't put a price to that.

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:41.614 align:middle line:10%
So, you know, the one
with the most toys

00:58:41.614 --> 00:58:43.030 align:middle line:10%
doesn't win at the
end of the day.

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:44.170 align:middle line:10%
Even though we've
been driven that we

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.270 align:middle line:10%
need to have a lot of
these extrinsic factors,

00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:49.370 align:middle line:10%
it's the intrinsic values
that are more important.

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And, so, it makes me happy
when people feel better.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.396 align:middle line:90%


00:58:54.396 --> 00:58:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I know this is a
lot of information.

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I know it's a lot of information
that's not commonly known.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's a
lot of information

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that many people may
look on it and say, oh,

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:03.680 align:middle line:90%
that can't be true.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the bottom line is,
we've proved to you tonight

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:06.990 align:middle line:90%
that it is true.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And, so, what we're
going to do now

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.250 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to show you how
to take control of your health.

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:12.500 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give you the
information that you need,

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.560 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge that you need, so
that you can empower yourself

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.550 align:middle line:90%
with health.

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:18.758 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to know,
from the bottom of my heart,

00:59:18.758 --> 00:59:20.600 align:middle line:84%
that I'm here for you,
that I care for you,

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and I want you to be healthy.

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So we've taken the
first step tonight.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's continue on
this journey tomorrow.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.558 align:middle line:84%
I look forward to
seeing you then.

00:59:28.558 --> 00:59:30.554 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:59:30.554 --> 00:59:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:45.895 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2012, I was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:59:45.895 --> 00:59:48.400 align:middle line:90%


00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.860 align:middle line:10%
Actually, the hardest
part for me at that point

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:53.560 align:middle line:10%
was telling the family.

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:57.520 align:middle line:10%
That was the most
emotional part.

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Because having cancer in
the family for so long,

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:04.420 align:middle line:84%
it was almost like I
expected it, to get cancer.

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
makes any sense.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I actually did,
it didn't surprise me

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:13.400 align:middle line:90%
all that much.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that I
had to tell the family,

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:20.850 align:middle line:84%
it was just, that was my
most heart-wrenching part

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.210 align:middle line:90%
of the whole thing, actually.

01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:23.860 align:middle line:84%
My daughter had
always had a fear

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of losing me because I had
lost my mother so young.

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So from a very
little child on up,

01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:33.727 align:middle line:84%
she had always been afraid
of losing her mother.

01:00:33.727 --> 01:00:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And so here I'm going to
have to give her the news

01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:38.876 align:middle line:90%
that that might very well be.

01:00:38.876 --> 01:00:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It was hard to
tell the boys too,

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:41.833 align:middle line:84%
but it was especially
hard to tell her

01:00:41.833 --> 01:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
because she was so fearful
of that all of her life.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, breast cancer is
the number one killer

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.770 align:middle line:10%
of women of cancer.

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And I had found a
lump in my breast,

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and I went to the doctor,
and I had a mammogram done.

01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Then they said it
didn't look good.

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:01.549 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to do a biopsy.

01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:03.340 align:middle line:84%
They did a biopsy, and
they said, yes, it's

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.440 align:middle line:84%
invasive carcinoma
breast cancer.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the invasive kind.

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:10.510 align:middle line:10%
And so then we did a lumpectomy.

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And when they did a
lumpectomy, then they

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.180 align:middle line:90%
did sentinel node biopsy.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And three out of three
lymph nodes that were tested

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:21.400 align:middle line:84%
were positive for invasive
cancer, and one of them

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
had actually gone
outside the lymph node.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So it used to be
that it would be

01:01:29.410 --> 01:01:31.420 align:middle line:84%
stage 4 once it's
in the lymph nodes,

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.970 align:middle line:84%
but they've changed
their staging.

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So mine-- actually, from the
information they had that I had

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.400 align:middle line:90%
three positive lymph nodes--

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.610 align:middle line:90%
it was stage 3B.

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:46.570 align:middle line:10%
And, so, usually,
that's a very grave--

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.210 align:middle line:10%
I knew how serious that was.

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:53.740 align:middle line:10%
Because, usually,
less than five years,

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:57.010 align:middle line:10%
depending on how fast it
went, whether to the brain

01:01:57.010 --> 01:02:00.940 align:middle line:10%
or to the lung or to the liver,
would be the deciding factor

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.200 align:middle line:10%
of how fast you died.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.790 align:middle line:90%


01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:09.760 align:middle line:10%
So this is what
happened for my cancer,

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.470 align:middle line:10%
and I chose my treatment.

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:13.700 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, I had
the ovaries removed,

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.780 align:middle line:10%
which was feeding the cancer,
which was causing the cancer,

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.710 align:middle line:10%
so I remove the hormones.

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So this was very grave, and
I knew how serious it was.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.120 align:middle line:10%
And so it was very hard
for me, even though I

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.020 align:middle line:10%
had decided to do a
natural treatment,

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:34.280 align:middle line:10%
it was not easy to go
against my physicians.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.080 align:middle line:90%
It was very hard.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
In April I had the
breast surgery.

01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I only did
lumpectomies, and they

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
wanted me to sign over the
fact that possibly they

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:47.830 align:middle line:84%
would do lymph node dissection
if they found cancer

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:50.580 align:middle line:90%
in the lymph nodes.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.080 align:middle line:90%
But I would not agree to that.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.560 align:middle line:10%
I went down to Uchee Pines,
which is a lifestyle center.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.229 align:middle line:10%
But I had actually
just gotten the news

01:03:00.229 --> 01:03:02.020 align:middle line:10%
that it was spread to
my lymph nodes, which

01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.670 align:middle line:10%
was kind of a heavy hit for me.

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:07.990 align:middle line:10%
Because, usually as a nurse
in the medical profession,

01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:11.320 align:middle line:10%
you know if somebody has a
lymph node involvement, that's

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.210 align:middle line:10%
pretty much, you're
going to have cancer

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.850 align:middle line:10%
all over the body pretty much.

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So it was really
emotional to deal with.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
But it took some readjusting
because I didn't expect it.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.860 align:middle line:10%
I thought it was just going to
be limited to the lumpectomies

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.290 align:middle line:10%
and that it wouldn't
be in the lymph nodes.

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:34.015 align:middle line:10%
But, anyway, when I got
down there, it was exciting.

01:03:34.015 --> 01:03:37.600 align:middle line:90%


01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.650 align:middle line:84%
Before every treatment
they would have prayer,

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and someone always
stayed right with you.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:50.560 align:middle line:10%
It's such a contrast to
our hospitals, you know?

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.740 align:middle line:10%
When I got back from
the lifestyle center,

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.470 align:middle line:10%
I had promised my doctor I'd go
see the oncologist-radiologist

01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:01.270 align:middle line:10%
and so I did that.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.730 align:middle line:10%
I decided against doing
the chemo and radiation,

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:06.410 align:middle line:10%
but they did want me
to get a PET scan.

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.860 align:middle line:10%
And, so, I had a
PET scan, which I

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:12.040 align:middle line:10%
was very reluctant to do that
because of the radioactive

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.470 align:middle line:10%
iodine, I mean, glucose.

01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:16.919 align:middle line:10%
And, so, I had it
done, and I was so

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.210 align:middle line:10%
thrilled about when I got
the results that they did not

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:23.770 align:middle line:10%
see any cancer in any organs.

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So I was really
thrilled about that

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.070 align:middle line:84%
that things that I
had done were working.

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:31.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't lose my hair.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:38.260 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sick and throwing
up and retching and going

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
through night sweats
and different things.

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I looked healthy, and I felt
healthy, and I still do.

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:47.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing health seminars.

01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So there is a better way
to treat cancer than what

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:57.340 align:middle line:90%
we're offering people today.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:01.450 align:middle line:10%
So when I got the
results from my PET scan,

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:03.100 align:middle line:10%
I got all the children
on a conference

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.982 align:middle line:10%
call-- we got Tim and David
and Stacy on a conference--

01:05:05.982 --> 01:05:07.690 align:middle line:10%
and they thought I
was going to give them

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:10.150 align:middle line:10%
some bad news because I told
them I was going to give them

01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:13.240 align:middle line:10%
my news about the PET scan.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.252 align:middle line:10%
And when I told them, you
know, it was almost like,

01:05:16.252 --> 01:05:17.710 align:middle line:10%
there was silence
on the other end.

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:19.670 align:middle line:10%
I thought, what's going on?

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:22.540 align:middle line:10%
I found out later, they
were actually crying for joy

01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:26.950 align:middle line:10%
because I had given them
that reassurance that the PET

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:27.860 align:middle line:10%
scan was good.

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:30.340 align:middle line:84%
They didn't see any
disease going on.

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.080 align:middle line:90%
And I felt good.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been walking
two miles a day.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm visiting in San Diego and
actually doing health seminars.

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:44.080 align:middle line:10%
It's been almost three
years that I was diagnosed,

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.580 align:middle line:10%
and so I'm loving it.

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:50.230 align:middle line:10%
So I really have
enjoyed the journey.

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:52.630 align:middle line:10%
It's been a growing process.

01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Having cancer and, you know,
you hear people saying,

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:57.970 align:middle line:90%
oh, it did wonders for me.

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, you think of your
love life, everything that's

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:03.940 align:middle line:84%
happening, you appreciate things
that are happening more, even

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.910 align:middle line:90%
just the simple things.

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I got to see my
grandson baptized,

01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:10.720 align:middle line:90%
and I was healthy there for him.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.900 align:middle line:10%
Just little things
in life mean a lot,

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.020 align:middle line:10%
that you can enjoy
them with your family.

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.130 align:middle line:10%
So there's the better way.

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:24.100 align:middle line:10%
And I hope soon we'll find
it'll be available to everybody

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.870 align:middle line:10%
to find these alternative
treatments that actually

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:30.212 align:middle line:10%
work for them.

01:06:30.212 --> 01:06:31.420 align:middle line:10%
There's many of them that do.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.400 align:middle line:10%
There's many options that we
have the scientific proof of.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.470 align:middle line:10%
When I went in to the
doctors and talked to them,

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:41.380 align:middle line:10%
and they wanted me
to do something else,

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:46.040 align:middle line:10%
it was very hard to go against
what they wanted me to do.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
But my gut feeling was that
I needed to go my own route

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:56.905 align:middle line:84%
and do natural treatments
because I felt like immunology

01:06:56.905 --> 01:07:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and increasing my immune system
was the way to treat my cancer.

01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And if that's what
you've decided,

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:08.170 align:middle line:90%
then that's what you need to do.

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
The hardest thing is to
go against your doctor

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.139 align:middle line:84%
and your family because usually
the families are saying,

01:07:13.139 --> 01:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
you've got to do
this or you're going

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
to die because that's what,
sometimes, the doctors will

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.180 align:middle line:90%
say.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you don't do chemo,
you might be dead in six months.

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.250 align:middle line:10%
I urge you to go
with what you feel

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.259 align:middle line:10%
is the right treatment for you.

01:07:26.259 --> 01:07:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And if I can make a
difference in somebody's life

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and help them to be
healthier and enjoy

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:34.960 align:middle line:84%
their life with their
family, it is a mission, yes.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think of it that
way, that so many people

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.270 align:middle line:90%
would be watching this.

01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And my husband said,
maybe your chest

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
will become your testimony,
and it has become my testimony.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:50.520 align:middle line:84%
My testimony is,
there is a better way,

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and you can enjoy life.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Just because you've been
given the diagnosis of cancer,

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:57.210 align:middle line:90%
don't lose hope.

01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:58.860 align:middle line:90%
You have hope.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.510 align:middle line:84%
God gives us a
hope and a future.

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:05.300 align:middle line:90%


01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.400 align:middle line:90%
It's been an amazing journey.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
To know now that this
testimony will go out

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
through the world and other
people will know there is hope.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not just hopeless.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:22.520 align:middle line:84%
There's hope and a
future with cancer.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.970 align:middle line:90%
