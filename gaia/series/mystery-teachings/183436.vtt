00:00:09.215 --> 00:00:12.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever been driving
on a regular route home

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:10%
and then suddenly you realize
you don't remember the last 20

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.485 align:middle line:10%
minutes of your drive at all?

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:10%
This happened to
me the other day

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:10%
when I got home from
a friend's house.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.280 align:middle line:84%
I thought, whoa, wait a
minute, how am I already home?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And oh my gosh,
how did I get here?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
It made me think, how often does
our subconscious take the wheel

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:90%
during our daily routines?

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Are we conditioned
to just give over

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
control and go through
our day unconsciously

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:90%
like sleepwalkers?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's say the human
brain is an iceberg.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:84%
While we're consciously
aware, both within ourselves

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and in our environment, it's
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, if we're
not paying attention,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
the amount we're aware of
is more like one snowflake

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.150 align:middle line:90%
on the tip of the iceberg.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of what's
happening in our brain

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:84%
is processed subconsciously
beneath the surface

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:90%
of our awareness.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
This gives you a sense of how
little we're actually aware of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and how much subconscious
processes tie up

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:90%
our brain capacity.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Our brain actually registers
100% of what we're exposed to.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
But psychologists
often say, we're

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
only consciously aware of
10%, just a tiny sliver

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:90%
of the information coming in.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there's quite a
bit of subconscious activity

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
going on behind the
scenes, and that activity

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
influences our thoughts and
actions, even though we're not

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:90%
aware of it.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Can we agree that
by not being aware,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
we're no longer in
the driver's seat?

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious thoughts,
emotions, and programs

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
are driving our course
of action in life,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and we're not even aware
that it's happening.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
If we're not aware, then we're
no longer in the driver's seat.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line
here is if we want

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
to have more of a hand
on our own journey

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and put our hands on
the steering wheel,

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.630 align:middle line:84%
we need to evolve
our conscious mind.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Part of this work starts with
using our senses intentionally.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The secret to this is that by
actively engaging our senses,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
we carry the torch
of consciousness

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:90%
deeper into the brain.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it
gets really exciting.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
By actively engaging
our senses, we

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
can strengthen our
connections and build

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:84%
bridges of consciousness
throughout the brain and body

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
In our journey to accessing
our full potential,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.780 align:middle line:84%
we must become more
consciously aware of the deeper

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.880 align:middle line:90%
processes of our brain.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Here, we come to the threshold
between the higher functioning

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.680 align:middle line:84%
regions of the cortex
and the midbrain.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
This area is known
as the limbic system.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a gateway between
the oldest parts

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:90%
of our brain and the cortex.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:84%
This area is the key to managing
our emotions, motivation,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
fear responses,
social interactions,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:90%
and long-term memories.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
We're often disconnected from
the subconscious influence

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:90%
of this area.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
In order to bridge
into the limbic system,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
we must cross this threshold by
going deeper within ourselves.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to
a transition point

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.320 align:middle line:84%
between our outer experience
and our inner self.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
As we make this shift from an
outward focus to an inward one,

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
we have to bring our
attention within.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:90%
And we must relax.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We must let go of tension in
the body, tuning into one's self

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
and letting go of the
stresses of the outside world.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
These are skills
that we can master.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to learn to
let go of stress at will.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
However, if we have a
disconnect or a faulty wiring

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
within the limbic
system, it can become

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:90%
extremely difficult to relax.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And when we're having
difficulty relaxing,

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:84%
it can lead to anxiety,
hypertension, or even ADHD.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
The good news is as we bring
our conscious awareness

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
into the limbic system,
we have the ability

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.520 align:middle line:84%
to release old,
suppressed emotions.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And by working
through this process,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
we're able to gain
greater mastery

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:90%
over our emotional state.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.770 align:middle line:10%
Another benefit is
that we also become

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.640 align:middle line:10%
more aware of the
motivations that drive us.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
This opens the door for us to
become more intentional in how

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
we choose to stimulate the
reward center within our brain.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So the question here is,
how do we access the system?

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Everything begins by relaxing.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
This helps us shift into
an alpha brainwave state.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The alpha state
is also a gateway

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:90%
between waking and sleeping.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
As we relax, we move from more
awake, active brainwave levels

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:84%
of the beta state
into an alpha state.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And that alpha state
is the frequency bridge

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
between our conscious mind
and our subconscious mind.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:84%
The deeper we go,
the more we relax.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
We ultimately move through alpha
into the more meditative theta

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:90%
state of 3 to 8 hertz.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
We have wonderful options to
help us to relax and access

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:90%
an alpha state.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Some you may have used before
are light meditation, yoga,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.290 align:middle line:84%
tai chi, even guided
visualizations.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And when we use these tools,
our brainwaves actually

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
slow down to the 8
to 12 hertz range

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:90%
that defines the alpha state.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And at this slowed-down
rate, we start to gain access

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:90%
to more spiritual energy.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
However, as adults, we tend to
operate our day-to-day lives

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.540 align:middle line:84%
while in the beta state,
which is about 13 to 35 hertz.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
That beta state
happens when we're

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the outer
world, which is distracting.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:10%
This makes it more difficult
to connect to the subtle realms

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:10%
and the spiritual frequencies.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
Children, on the
other hand, primarily

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:90%
operate in an alpha a state.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, they're highly
connected to a spiritual state

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:90%
of being.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
They're constantly accessing
this imaginative, dreamlike

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they experience
so many inner visions.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Adults often label these
as fantasy or imagination.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But to a child, these inner
visions are very real.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
When adults relax, we
are able to open up

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to more of our spiritual
connection too,

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:90%
much like children do.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And we may start to
perceive and receive

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:90%
more spiritual energies.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
This allows us to tap
into the imagery, symbols,

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and sacred geometry patterns
that lie within the fabric

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.040 align:middle line:90%
of the higher dimensions.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
These symbols and imageries
are the building blocks

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:84%
of creation, and they're
based on sacred geometries

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and archetypes.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Another state in which we often
access these building blocks

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:90%
of creation is during sleep.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Our dreams communicate to
us through these archetypes

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:90%
and symbols.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And if our third
eye is open enough

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
and we know how to shift
our brainwaves at will,

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.830 align:middle line:84%
we may even perceive these
energies while fully awake.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
For us to access these
transcendent states,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
we must bring our
awareness to what we can

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:90%
call the introspection bridge.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
This is where we begin
to tune into ourselves

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and bring our conscious
awareness into the functions

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:90%
of the limbic system.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:84%
The key to this is to
shift our attention away

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
from the outside world
and into our body.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:84%
We can do this by
noticing what sensations

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:90%
we feel within our body.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
This helps us to pick up
on subtle feelings, which

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
is a way for us to tune
into our emotional state.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Over time and with
practice, we become

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%
used to shifting easily into
the alpha brainwave state,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:90%
even with our eyes open.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But starting out, we begin by
closing our eyes and relaxing.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Start by releasing
tension and letting

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.580 align:middle line:90%
go of physical attachments.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Allow the mind to
drift into whatever

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:90%
imagery presents itself.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Tai chi and moving
meditation really

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.980 align:middle line:84%
help make a shift
into this alpha state.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:84%
We also focus on the breath to
bring our mind and attention

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:90%
inwards.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:84%
In tai chi or qi
gong, we flow energy

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
while slowly moving the
body, pulling in energy

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
from the earth and
the universe and then

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:84%
flowing it back out
through the aura.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, this kind
of deep introspection

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
guides us to ask the
big questions in life.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.870 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose?

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And in order to tune in and be
in touch with our true selves,

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:90%
we have to ask these questions.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:90%
Why do I feel what I feel?

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that I'm supposed
to learn from this situation?

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:84%
If we focus on small details
or on external drama,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.360 align:middle line:90%
the lessons won't come.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:84%
But if we can ask
these deeper questions,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
if we can ask, what is
it revealing about me,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.240 align:middle line:84%
we can move through and
elevate any experience

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:90%
to a higher perspective.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.790 align:middle line:84%
No matter what challenges
we face in life,

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:84%
asking these questions
opens the possibility

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:90%
to change and transformation.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:84%
By asking the questions and
tuning in for the answers,

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.500 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to discern
the inner, subtle realms

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.250 align:middle line:84%
These questions help connect
us to our inner wisdom

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
In order to heal, we
must do the work and face

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:90%
what's going on inside of us.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Healing really is the key.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to do
that is to peel back

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.100 align:middle line:84%
the layers like an onion and to
get to the core of the issue.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Distracting oneself
won't change anything.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
It just means that our emotions
will remain there buried.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't deal
with them, then they

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:84%
will eventually take their
toll on our well-being.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:10%
But then the question is,
is it possible to deal

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:10%
with emotions we may not
be consciously aware of?

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Our senses are tools
that we can use

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate the limbic
system and facilitate healing.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
One good way to stimulate
the limbic in and particular

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:90%
is with a aroma therapy.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:90%
Aroma therapy helps us to relax.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And because of
our sense of smell

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.950 align:middle line:84%
is linked to our
emotions and memories,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:84%
we can use it to help
release emotional wounds

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and old memories, even the
ones we didn't know we had.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:90%
The process is quite simple.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Using an essential
oil like lavender,

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.290 align:middle line:84%
we breathe it in and focus
on what we want to bring in.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, I breathe in
forgiveness and healing.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And as we breathe out,
we release whatever

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:90%
it is we choose to release.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:45.636 align:middle line:84%
For example I release my
anger, or I release my sadness.

00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
affirm this out loud

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and say what we're
letting go of.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.600 align:middle line:84%
Ancient spiritual traditions
have always used oils

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.210 align:middle line:90%
to expand consciousness.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.840 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, for example, every
sephiroth on the tree of life

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
has a unique correspondence
of herbs and essential oils.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Each part of the
tree also corresponds

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to a different healing
benefit, an aspect of ourself.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:10%
Working with the
tree of life, allows

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:10%
us to find an appropriate
oil to support us

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:10%
in healing a specific aspect
of our mind, our body,

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:10%
and our life.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life
is a blueprint that

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
can help us identify where
that emotional wound or issue

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.930 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Once we identify what part of
the tree of life it relates to,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.200 align:middle line:84%
we can then choose
a corresponding oil

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to help us deal with the
emotions or issues in our life.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's say we're
struggling with self-worth.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah reveals
that this is related

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.820 align:middle line:84%
to an imbalance in Kether, the
very top of the tree of life

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:90%
located above our head.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the aromas
assigned to Kether

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
is frankincense, a very high,
vibrational, and sacred oil.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And what we can do then is use
this high quality frankincense

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.920 align:middle line:84%
oil to anoint our crown
and then rub the remaining

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.190 align:middle line:84%
amount on our wrists, our
palms, and then breathe it

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:90%
in deep several times.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:84%
With each in breath,
affirm something

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
like, I breathe in my
divinity and my worthiness.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
With each out breath say, I
release all guilt and shame.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Make this a daily practice.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:90%
But what about other senses?

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
What other senses
stimulate emotion for us?

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been moved
by a piece of music?

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Most of us have.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Since the auditory
nerve is strongly

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
limbic system, it

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
allows certain sounds to deeply
stimulate our emotional center

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.610 align:middle line:90%
within the brain.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Music can also create
a cathartic experience.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers often turn
to music to help cope

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:90%
with their intense emotions.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
They use music to
express themselves

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and to release whatever
emotional buildup they have,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
whether it's sadness,
anger, or joy.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Now that we understand
the power of music,

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:84%
the important
question is, how do we

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
find music that will actually
help us rewire and heal

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.046 align:middle line:90%
the limbic system?

00:15:32.046 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
when looking for music

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.280 align:middle line:84%
that will help us to
shift into an alpha state,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
there are two things
to keep in mind.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:84%
One is that the music
is rhythmic and calming.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:84%
The other is to use
music with no lyrics.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:84%
If the music has
lyrics, we end up

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
processing those lyrics with the
language centers of the cortex.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to
do that if our goal is

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
to consciously access
the deeper brain centers.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
We actually want the music
to fade into the background

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:84%
so that it becomes
almost like wallpaper.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:90%
We're not focusing on it.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:84%
We might not even
notice it, yet the music

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:90%
adds to the overall environment.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.660 align:middle line:84%
When we look at this as it
relates to brain development,

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.620 align:middle line:84%
we see that natural
sounds and music

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
are processed within the
deeper part of the brain.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Throughout our
evolution, humans were

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
exposed to the sounds
of nature far earlier

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:90%
than words or language.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So music without lyrics
is the most effective way

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:84%
for stimulating the
limbic system in addition

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:90%
to aroma therapy.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And it moves us out of the
language centers of the cortex

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and into deeper
regions of the brain.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.900 align:middle line:84%
One system of music
thought to bring us

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
into an emotionally rich state
so that we can access subtle,

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
spiritual energies is known
as solfeggio frequencies.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They first emerged within
these religious and spiritual

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
ceremonies to inspire states
of spiritual transcendence.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:10%
Solfeggio frequencies are
based on a numerology system

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:10%
where each number can be
reduced down to a 3, 6, or 9.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla once
said, if you only

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
knew the significance
of the 3, 6, and 9,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:84%
then you would have the
keys to the universe.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Numbers are truly the building
blocks of the universe.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And they hold the
keys to harnessing

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:90%
the energies of the cosmos.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Music and chants tuned
to solfeggio frequencies

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
stimulate the limbic system,
which helps release emotions

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:90%
and accelerate healing.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:84%
This kind of music can
bring us into a state

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual transcendence.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And as we turn inward, we may
encounter an emotional charge

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:90%
buried within our subconscious.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And when this emotion
rises to the surface,

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:07.460 align:middle line:84%
we're able to come into greater
awareness, which in turn,

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:90%
allows us to heal, to let go.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we're able
to create a new pattern.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:84%
And once we release,
it's important to have

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.790 align:middle line:84%
a strategy in
place for how we're

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:84%
going to replace the old
pattern because as we

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
let go of the old, we
must bring in the new.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
Like tuning the radio dial,
each solfeggio frequency

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:90%
has a specific vibration.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:10%
According to Leonard
Horowitz, they each

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:10%
correspond to a
different benefit.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
396 hertz is associated with
liberating guilt and fear.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
417 hertz assists with undoing
situations and facilitating

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.970 align:middle line:84%
change, thus breaking up
crystallized, emotional

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
528 hertz has been used
by genetic biochemists

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:84%
to structure water and
relax the DNA coil.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.070 align:middle line:84%
It's said to be associated with
transformation and miracles,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
while 639 hertz brings greater
whole brain connectedness.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It supports us with
connecting in relationships

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and having overall
experience of unity.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
741 hertz is related
to awakening intuition

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.885 align:middle line:90%
and nonlinear knowing.

00:19:26.885 --> 00:19:32.290 align:middle line:84%
852 hertz is returning to
what we call spiritual order

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and training us
into an experience

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.600 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Now keep in mind,
these frequencies

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:84%
aren't meant to be used
as a scale altogether.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead, each number becomes the
base of its own tuning scale.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And a powerful
combination is to start

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
with a solfeggio frequency
as the base number

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and then to use
Pythagorean tuning scale

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:90%
to build off of it.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:10%
Each step up the
scale would then

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:04.275 align:middle line:10%
be a perfect 5th ratio in line
with the Fibonacci sequence.

00:20:04.275 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a little
mystery school secret.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:84%
The solfeggio frequencies
use numerology

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to attune to the pure Hermetic
and Ensofic rays of energy,

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.270 align:middle line:90%
the primary rays of creation.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So beyond helping
us rewire our brain,

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.990 align:middle line:84%
we're working with
these esoteric energies

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
that connect us into these
powerful rays of creation.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's all
about vibration.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:84%
All energy in the universe has
certain frequency of vibration.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Each of us have a
range of frequencies

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.555 align:middle line:84%
that we may vibrate at
in in any given moment.

00:20:46.555 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And many factors within
our day-to-day life

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
influence our energy
and our vibration.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Everything we choose
to eat or drink,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.840 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, whether negative
or positive, our emotions--

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.410 align:middle line:84%
all of these have
influence on our energy.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Humans are actually
naturally supposed

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:90%
to operate at the 528 hertz.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed to be
our homeostasis point.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:84%
When we can bring our
whole being into coherence

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.790 align:middle line:84%
with this single
frequency, that is

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
when we have arrived at an
enlightenment type of state.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
We are in tune with the
universal galactic vibration.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the original
vibration of the Hermetic ray,

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:90%
the first ray.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Any deviation from this pure
ray results in misalignment

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
with our galactic oneness.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:10%
In addition to raising
our baseline frequencies

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:10%
to a higher level, what
if we could actually

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:10%
raise our baseline
for experiencing

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:10%
more pleasure in life?

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:10%
Let's explore this
possibility by looking

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:10%
at another core structure
of the limbic system, which

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:10%
is the hippocampus area.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
When this area is stimulated,
biochemicals like dopamine

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.250 align:middle line:84%
are released, and we
feel good, really good.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.770 align:middle line:84%
It's our reward center
and our pleasure center

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.320 align:middle line:90%
within the brain.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Now naturally, people crave
a rush of this dopamine.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And they seek it out
by going to parties

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:84%
or going dancing
or playing games.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But often, these moments of
pleasure are short lived,

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and so we end up going
back for more and more.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And this drive to keep
the dopamine flowing

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:31.560 align:middle line:84%
can lead to unhealthy
habits and addictions.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Now both the hippocampus
and the basal ganglia

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.430 align:middle line:84%
are strongly connected to our
sense of happiness, motivation,

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.740 align:middle line:90%
and emotional well-being.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.790 align:middle line:84%
These areas regulate our
motivational behavior

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and help us take action
on the goals we set.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:84%
We activate these areas
in those moments when

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.820 align:middle line:84%
we feel like we've
just solved a puzzle

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:84%
or in moments of joy or
laughter, like the aha moment

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:90%
or a punchline of a joke.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.400 align:middle line:84%
These give us this
sense of feeling

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:90%
good and of satisfaction.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And here's the key.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The more work we do
to get to that moment,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:90%
the more enriching it is.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I see this when we dive into the
esoteric studies of hermetics.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And students have this
experience all the time.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like the lights come on,
and there's this aha moment.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's earned because the
student put the puzzle together

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.310 align:middle line:90%
within themselves.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that is taught.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.980 align:middle line:84%
It's creating an
opportunity for the puzzle

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.630 align:middle line:84%
to come together so that you
can have your own revelation

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:90%
and insight into yourself.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.120 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a new
perspective of who we are

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:90%
and what this life is about.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It gives us insight into
our sense of purpose

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and what we should be
doing with our lives.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:84%
As we move out of inertia and
toward greater empowerment

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and progression, it's
profoundly powerful.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:10%
In today's world, all
kinds of industries

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:10%
have found ways to capitalize
upon the pleasure center,

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:13.240 align:middle line:10%
and they steer our
choices and daily habits.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.700 align:middle line:84%
We're encouraged
towards consumerism,

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and so we waste our time
chasing these moments

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
of immediate and
fleeting pleasure

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:90%
without a sense of fulfillment.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But in ancient
spiritual practices,

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:84%
there's a tradition of
accessing the pleasure state yet

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
in a more holistic
and conscious way

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:90%
to stimulate our whole being.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a path of progression
towards embodying our divinity.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:90%
And there's real joy in that.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
We can choose how we use
this motivational center

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to keep us moving
forward towards greater

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.920 align:middle line:90%
fulfillment and growth.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Now the path towards
balancing the limbic system

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:90%
can be challenging.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.010 align:middle line:84%
But the work we do here
brings an even greater reward.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
When we approach this
introspection bridge,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.990 align:middle line:84%
the very first challenge
is to face ourselves.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.870 align:middle line:84%
When we tune in, we
have the opportunity

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.740 align:middle line:90%
to sit with ourselves.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And this can be uncomfortable
because emotions buried

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.120 align:middle line:90%
under the surface may rise up.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.735 align:middle line:84%
It may be an emotional
experience, but it's good.

00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It can be a
cathartic and healing

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:84%
release of old, buried emotions,
and it can move them out

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:90%
of our system.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.140 align:middle line:84%
If a suppressed emotion has
been there for long times,

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:84%
we've probably pushed it away
to avoid dealing with it.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And when our emotions
are suppressed,

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:90%
they go into a passive state.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:51.010 align:middle line:84%
But during moments of
high stress, they surface.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And they make the situation
more difficult and confusing

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't help
to suppress emotions.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
They will get the better
of us at some point.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So our goal as we step across
the introspection bridge

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.430 align:middle line:90%
is to go in and heal.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.730 align:middle line:84%
In order to heal and
release this emotion,

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.600 align:middle line:84%
we bring it from a passive
state to an active one.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And we do that by allowing
ourselves to feel it.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.390 align:middle line:84%
When we step up to face
these buried emotions,

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
it gives us the opportunity
to decide when and how we're

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:90%
going to deal with them.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the emotion may
rise up at the wrong time

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:40.170 align:middle line:90%
and catch us off guard.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So instead, we want to
tune in and allow ourselves

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:84%
to feel them on
our time and then

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.610 align:middle line:84%
find the proper
outlets to release them

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:90%
in a safe and constructive way.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
But first, we need
to give ourselves

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:59.870 align:middle line:84%
permission to go there
and be in that emotion.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
tools that can

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:05.740 align:middle line:84%
help us process these
emotions in a healthy way.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Journaling is really helpful
for acknowledging and releasing

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.440 align:middle line:90%
those emotions.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:90%
Using essential oils is helpful.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And when we combine that with
the affirmation and trauma

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:90%
release, it's even better.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Listening to the right music or
going into a somatic therapist

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to help us also with
releasing this trauma

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:90%
can be extremely valuable.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:84%
If we don't process and
release these emotions,

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:90%
they get stuck in the body.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:84%
They get stored in our
organs, and this can

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:90%
lead to chronic health issues.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
We may try to treat
the physical body,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:90%
but there's an emotional source.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And when the unresolved
emotion manifests physically,

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.860 align:middle line:90%
it causes problems for us.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.380 align:middle line:10%
Somatic methods are
a great way to help

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:10%
us find those areas in the body
where the emotional blockages

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:10%
are stored.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And then using a
combination of breath

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
and active imagination
plus some subtle movements,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.300 align:middle line:90%
we tune in to what's there.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Using sound and tones, we can
move that energy up and out

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.670 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's now pull this all together
into a practical approach

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
to balance these areas
within the limbic system.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.780 align:middle line:84%
We've discussed the
solfeggio frequencies

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate the hippocampus and
activate the emotional center

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.570 align:middle line:84%
A great album to start with
is JS Epperson's Solfeggio

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Frequency or The Creative
Alchemy Instrumental Mix.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I also recommend an artist by
the name of Source Vibrations

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.850 align:middle line:84%
who works with solfeggio
frequencies quite effectively.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.300 align:middle line:84%
While playing solfeggio
frequencies in the background,

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.850 align:middle line:90%
we can take this a step further.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
We can then bring in the
essential oils and breathing

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.230 align:middle line:84%
techniques to activate and
release emotions from the body.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Different oils will work
with different aspects

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.310 align:middle line:90%
of our emotions.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Frankincense is a very
high vibrational oil.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacred oil.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And research shows
it lifts the spirit

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and is actually a
natural antidepressant.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:84%
We can work with the oil
by placing a drop of it

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:84%
on one palm and then
swirling it around clockwise

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:84%
to activate it, then
breathe it in deeply,

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
breathing in through the nose
and out through the mouth.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in and affirm
a positive quality,

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:84%
whatever you'd like to
bring in, whether it's

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:35.020 align:middle line:90%
peace or healing or joy.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And then breathe out and name
whatever negative emotion needs

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.630 align:middle line:90%
to be released.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.360 align:middle line:90%
It can be something like this.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I breathe in joy, and
I release my anger.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:10%
Or I release my
pain or my sadness,

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.280 align:middle line:10%
whatever it is for you.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And this can be repeated until
you start to feel a shift.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:10%
Oils like lavender, rosemary,
chamomile, or patchouli

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:09.270 align:middle line:10%
are also good and have more of
an emotional quality to them.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:84%
A higher therapeutic
grade essential oil

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.030 align:middle line:84%
will also penetrate
the blood-brain barrier

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:90%
when breathed in deeply.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Another way to
work with the oils

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:23.850 align:middle line:84%
is to anoint the body to assist
with this release process.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Anoint wherever that emotion is
held within your body, wherever

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.150 align:middle line:90%
it feels stuck.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It's always good to
anoint also at the heart

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:84%
or the solar plexus, anoint the
risks, the sides of the neck,

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:90%
also behind the ears.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.120 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve runs along
the neck down into the heart

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.040 align:middle line:90%
and even to the gut.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And by anointing behind the
ears or the sides of the neck,

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:51.120 align:middle line:84%
we're activating the nerves that
travel to many of the organs

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:90%
within our body.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:90%
This process is also cathartic.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.990 align:middle line:84%
It can be intense at times,
but it's very effective.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Once the emotion
is released, we can

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.220 align:middle line:84%
return to a state
of grace and relief

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:84%
from both the physical
and the emotional pain.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.330 align:middle line:84%
We can return to a state of
homeostasis with more joy

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:90%
and ease.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:18.120 align:middle line:10%
We can experience greater
coherence within ourselves.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Releasing these old and
stuck emotions from the body

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.080 align:middle line:84%
takes a weight off of
our backs, and the result

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is an expansiveness,
a broadening

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.210 align:middle line:90%
of our emotional spectrum.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.300 align:middle line:10%
We'll have a greater
bandwidth and more compassion

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.540 align:middle line:10%
for others and for ourselves.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:40.280 align:middle line:84%
There's one final
key to share here.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Embrace laughter in
this healing process.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.370 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
like a good laugh

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to trigger our limbic
system with positive input.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And laughter also synchronizes
many parts of our brain.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.130 align:middle line:84%
It's great medicine, and
it has a contagious effect.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Laughing bonds us
together and leaves us

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.020 align:middle line:90%
with a sense of euphoria.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Those who reach higher
states of consciousness

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.550 align:middle line:84%
often describe
reaching a point where

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.700 align:middle line:90%
they are more frequently happy.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And they are able to
laugh at themselves

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.770 align:middle line:84%
and find joy and pleasure
in each step of the journey.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:18.770 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama is a
great example of this.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.620 align:middle line:84%
He can be silly, and
he loves to laugh.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:84%
He brings joy and humor
into everything he does.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Crossing this
introspection bridge

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and activating the full
potential of the limbic system

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.690 align:middle line:84%
is our pathway to reach this
expanded emotional spectrum.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It shifts our vibration
and our baseline

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:84%
towards feeling more
content and joyful in life.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:84%
of our human potential with
